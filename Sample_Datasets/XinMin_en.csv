"I did n’t go home for more than ten days, and worked for more than 12 hours a day",“Police“ Police ”across the river,Space,"Chief reporter Pan Gaofeng ""Thank you so much, you helped us busy, and you want you to put money. We are really embarrassed."" This is the third time I thanked Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, who lives in the Linyi Building of Dongfang Road. But she was pushed back. Lin Weibin is a community police at the South Pier Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Pudong New District. Since the occurrence of the epidemic, he has been fighting the front line of resistance. Until yesterday, he hadn't returned home for more than ten days. On March 30, Lin Weibin, who maintained order at the nucleic acid detection point, met Aunt Dong's family. ""At that time, she looked particularly anxious and helpless. Mr. Ge, her husband, had been anxiously saying something. I felt that something would be something, so I went to ask."" Seeing Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, 63, was overjoyed. ""Police Officer Lin, our children's medicine has been broken for more than half a month. I think he is a bit wrong, it is really anxious."" Lin Weibin stunned. Looking at Xiao Ge behind Aunt Dong, he found that his eyes were really manic. Xiao Ge is a psychiatric patient. Every month, his parents took him to the Shanghai Mental Health Center on No. 600, Wuxing Ping South Road, Puxi to see a doctor, and the condition has been well controlled. But since this epidemic, because of continuously being closed at home, the medicine has been taken for a long time. With Pudong Puxi promoted a new round of grid -based ribinic acid screening, cross -strait traffic interruption, and the distribution of medicines became a difficult problem. Aunt Dong and her husband were very worried about this. ""You do nucleic acids first, go back to the medical insurance card to give me a way, I come to find a way."" Lin Weibin comforted and reported to the police station immediately. After receiving the consent of the sub -bureau, he decided to run a trip to help Xiaoge with medicine. Lin Weibin did not set off immediately. He found several other neighborhood committees he had jurisdictionary and asked about the medication of mental patients. He found that there were still two cases of drug breaks. He also came to ask the medical insurance card. In order not to delay participation in nucleic acid testing, at noon that day, Lin Weibin drove to Wanping South Road without eating meals. With the help of a volunteer of the Municipal Commercial Committee, he contacted the hospital. Aunt Dong did not give enough money. He also paid for his own pocket and cooked the money to help Xiaoge with good medicine. However, the other two patients did not have seen a doctor at the Shanghai Mental Health Center before, and could not prescribe medicine according to regulations. Lin Weibin rushed back again, and inquired that they were usually seeing a doctor at the Pudong Yuandong Mental Health Center, and hurriedly drove over, finished the medicine, and delivered them one by one. When things were resolved, Lin Weibin was relieved. Aunt Dong's family was grateful and found that Lin Weibin also helped put the medicine money. He found Lin Weibin three times and wanted to return the money to him. This appeared at the beginning of the article. ""For the community police, it is also internal affairs to control the mental patient."" Lin Weibin told reporters that under the epidemic, many things that happened at all happened. ""It's hard to everyone. If you help, you can win a little more understanding and support."" In fact, ""difficult"" is Lin Weibin himself. On March 22, he was maintaining order at the nucleic acid detection point and suddenly received a notice. His community found a confirmed case and was about to be closed. The leader knew that Lin Weibin's wife was a doctor at Puonan Hospital. The child was in the third year of high school this year and did not order death. He made him decide whether to go home or stay in the front line. At that time, Lin Weibin called his wife. The wife was on duty and never answered. Hesitating again and again, he decided to last. ""It's not easy, you can do more or do more."" He hurried home, took two sets of clothes to change, and explained a few words with his son, and rushed back to the police station. Since then, he has been sleeping at the police station and never returned home. On the afternoon of March 30, Lin Weibin, who was busy after the community nucleic acid detection, was preparing to return to the police station. Suddenly discovered that 3 medical workers who had done nucleic acid testing in the community were running on the road. Catch it back and return without merit. He hurried up and asked what could help. It turned out that the three were nurses of the Oriental Hospital. Before wearing ""big white"" as nucleic acid that morning, they put the replaced clothes and three medical PDAs in a bag. Unexpectedly, the cleaner who received medical waste was not noticed, and it was taken away as a garbage bag. There are data scanning data in the three PDAs, and it is very valuable, and the three nurses have broken. Lin Weibin decided to help. He found that the nearby medical waste garbage was dispatched to dispose of the special disposal point to the West West Road of Pushan Road, and immediately drove the nurses and rushed over. At the scene, everyone couldn't help but take a breath: each garbage bag was piled up like hills. When will this be found? As Lin Weibin comforted everyone, he found the staff and asked what was the latest garbage, and then took the nurses to find a garbage bag and a garbage bag. After turning more than 30 garbage bags, nothing was obtained. At this time, a new car was transported. Lin Weibin asked the driver carefully and found that it was very likely that it was very likely to lose things on this car. Sure enough, after more than ten garbage bags, the clothes and the lost PDA of the nurse were among them! After the disinfecting, Lin Weibin sent the nurse back to the hospital again, so that he could eat something. ""In fact, there will be a lot of such things every day, helping the patients with medicine, sending the elderly for blood transmissions, and buying vegetables for residents ..."" Lin Weibin told reporters that these days, he gets up at 5 o'clock every day and send colleagues one by one to one by one to one by one. After ordering, I returned to the jurisdiction of the community and worked for more than 12 hours a day. Fight continuously. ""But who is not tired? None of the community workers and doctors and nurses I saw."" Lin Weibin said that he was a veteran, and he was transferred to the community police after retiring. ""Back to the place yesterday, with tea replacement, to celebrate the video of a few comrades -in -arms who had just lifted the isolation. Everyone was encouraging and said that I was good.""",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-01/8.htm,2022-04-01,8th edition: Shanghai News

Talking about the performance of the first two stations, Zhou Guanyu gave a summary of ""the overall is quite satisfied, but he still has a lot of potential to dig, and it will continue to enhance competitiveness in the future"". At the same time, he also hopes that Shanghai will get out of the haze of the epidemic as soon as possible: ""I believe we will be able to overcome difficulties and make everything return to normal as soon as possible. I also look forward to participating in the F1 China Grand Prix as soon as possible."" Fully preparing for a previous interview before the season, it has not been in the competition. Zhou Guanyu, who shows his skills on the Tao, once said that the goal of this year is to finish the game as much as possible, and at the same time strive to get points. Looking back at the scene a few months later, the Chinese driver said with a smile: ""I did not expect the first stop to complete the small target."" Behind the successful results, the full preparation and start of Zhou Guanyu and the team before the season will be indispensable. After continuous adjustment and improvement. In order to adapt to the rhythm of F1 as soon as possible and avoid hitting the so -called ""new wall"", this winter, Zhou Guanyu gave up most of the rest time and stayed in the team factory to discuss the details of racing adjustment with technicians and staff. ""It was very busy that winter, and we discussed almost every aspect of each one that could affect the competition and driving feelings."" He took his own driving style as an example. ""Because it is the first year to enter F1, it may be in terms of long distances. It is relatively good at it. In terms of improving the speed of a single circle, you need to accumulate more experience. """" I feel that I have a lot of gains than after two stops. ""Zhou Guanyu bluntly said in the interview that At that time, he heard a lot of different voices. At that time, he understood that the road to F1 was full of thorns, and he needed to speak with better results. However, even with psychological preparations, the various situations on the track on the track of Barin still made him inevitably nervous. ""I feel like I have been in a roller coaster. I feel that I can get points in the last second. The next second may change due to the condition of the tires and yellow flags. Zhou Guanyu, after becoming F1's official driver, is a ""successful star chase"". In the two games of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, ""China Week"" has a record with idol Alonso and Hamilton. Speaking of this, ""Little Fan Brother"" gave a somewhat unexpected answer: ""I feel envious when watching their game on the screen. When I really met on the track, I would not think that the person in front of the person was the person in front of it was The idol is still the world champion. At that moment, my goal was to surpass him. ""In the Saudi station competition ending last week, Zhou Guanyu won the 11th place, regretted the losses and the points of the points. It is the Seven Crown King Hamilton. Because of the relationship between the playback position and the lens, many Chinese fans failed to see the pursuit. Yesterday, Zhou Guanyu restored the situation at the time. ""When there is no time left in the game, I know that I am in 11 digits, so I have improved the speed and pursued to the Hamilton in front of me."" He particularly emphasized that at that time, he only tried his best to win a point, and did not care about it. In front of it is one of the idols ""old man"". Next weekend, F1 will move to the Melbourne Albert Park. At present, Zhou Guanyu is following the Alpha Romeo team to prepare for the game as planned. The experience of the first two stations also made Zhou Guanyu look forward to the later competitions. ""From the perspective of the situation I know, there may be many Chinese car fans to come to the scene to cheer, which is exciting, but the goal is still not. Change, finish the match and strive for points, and also hope to impact the third stage in the ranking match, and strive to bring you more surprises. ""This reporter Lu Weixin dialogue Zhou Guanyu reporter: The first two games have achieved good records, What do you feel about changing? Zhou Guanyu: Mainly in terms of mentality, there are a lot of voices when signing the contract, and even some of them are not based on facts. I have never responded to it, I hope to prove myself with grades. The current situation is not bad. I received points and was recognized by the team. I felt more peaceful. Reporter: In the last game, the team had some mistakes. What exchanges did this after the game? Zhou Guanyu: The last game was because the team made a ride -handed channel, which caused them not to receive a penalty for 5 seconds when I needed to stop at the station. I believe that the car group will discuss and adjust the relevant situation. I will give them more encouragement to avoid the overall emotions and morale. Reporter: When the relevant person in charge of the long -term sports was interviewed, they talked about that after you signed the F1, the car became popular in the country. Many teenagers may choose to engage in this project. What do you say to them? Zhou Guanyu: I am glad that more and more friends are concerned about the car movement, and I also thank them for their support. All I can do is to make good performance as much as possible, and use results to prove that Chinese drivers are also capable of standing on F1. For friends who are interested in engaging in racing sports, I think the most important thing is to be down -to -earth and stabilize every step. Do not always think about completing the ""jump"", because only by laying a good foundation can you realize your dreams in the future and stand on the expected arena on the field.

Space ,Wedding dress ,Space ,"Ge Kunyuan reached the season of Qingming again. As usual, I would think of some friends who died. Teacher Lu Xiuzhen was one of them. Lu Xiuzhen was originally the editor -in -chief of ""Northern Literature"" and a editor of a wedding dress who worked in Harbin all year round. After retirement, she came to Shanghai in her old age with her husband and famous scholar Wang Guanquan. I am a friend of them for many years. I like to listen to them about the past. They are good guests and like to chat. It is often a cup of tea, a glass of wine, chatting for a long time. What Lu Xiuzhen talked the most was the past that she had associated with the author. On one occasion, Lu Xiuzhen affectionately talked about her and the famous female writer Chi Zijian. At the beginning, Lu Xiuzhen proudly said: ""Chi Zijian is the main force of the Chinese contemporary literary world"" and the winner of the Mao Dun Literature Award. Her novels are well -known at home and abroad, and several countries have translated her works. And when I knew her, I knew her. She was only eighteen or nine years old and just started to work. ""Lu Xiuzhen said that that year, Song Xuemeng, a youth editor of"" Northern Literature "", went out to form a manuscript, and found a student named Chi Zijian to discuss the manuscript. I thought it was a boy, but the little girl came. Her novel ""That Lost ..."" was quickly published in ""Northern Literature"" by the modification. This is her ""debut"", which is picked up by the editor, so she is very grateful and excited. When she received the first manuscript fee, she went to the store to buy a bottle of ""bamboo leaf green"" that father loved to drink. Their father and daughter are deeply affectionate. Her name is from her father. Her father hopes that her daughter can have a literary talent like Cao Zifang. Soon, Lu Xiuzhen served as the deputy editor -in -chief of ""Northern Literature"" and held the first Xingkai Lake novel class. Here Lu Xiuzhen saw Chi Zijian for the first time. She is the youngest in the class. She doesn't speak much and likes to think. Lu Xiuzhen was sincere, quite affinity, and smiled, all showing the feelings of loved ones. Soon, she and Chi Zijian became ""forgetting the year."" They often contacted and do nothing. Chi Zijian is sometimes a bit naughty. In the letter, she claimed to be ""Xiao Chizi"", and also sent a lot of life photos to Lu Xiuzhen. One of them was a bit blatter: she sprinkled her hands and smiled on the sculpture of giant pandas in the park. There were a few conversations behind the photo: big panda (arched as a cricket): Miss, good behavior, the little panda hungry It's time to feed it. Me: (Lest): No, I haven't played enough, and then take me five steps. Big panda (a smart machine): Look, lady, you ride on me, the park managers have to be punished for you. I (shaking my head): It doesn't matter, the old bear, I prepare for the manuscript fee in my pocket. Seeing Lu Xiuzhen here, the last sentence was her words. This is her happiness! During the relationship, Lu Xiuzhen found that although Chi Zijian was naive, lively, and cute, her work contained deep thoughts. Soon, Chi Zijian's novel ""Sleeping Da Gu Qigu"" was published. Lu Xiuzhen enthusiastically pointed out in the editor: This novel is ""a declaration of a new life."" This evaluation has been recognized by many readers. Lu Xiuzhen not only tried to recommend Chi Zijian's novels in China, but also managed to introduce her novels abroad. Chi Zijian published the local narrative ""Hulu Street Singing Evening"" in ""Northern Literature"" was recommended by Lu Xiuzhen and her husband, translated into English by American sinologist Ge Haowen, pushed to overseas ... When I heard this, I said with emotion: ""You are really a good editor who wants to be a wedding dress for others wholeheartedly!"" Lu Xiuzhen said with a smile: ""These are what I should do as a editor. I can from our magazine The emergence of excellent writers like Chi Zijian is the honor of our magazine and my honor! ""Chi Zijian respects the editor of the wedding dress very much. For Auntie Lu, she kept it in her heart. She once wrote: ""I have a poem written at the age of 19 in my diary, called"" Grass "": Grass is the foil of flowers, the element of human freedom, cattle and sheep is your loyal partner, you are fresh milk, you are not or not The source of the end ... I hope ""Northern Literature"" can be a grass that can be made in literature; I hope those cattle and sheep who get 'fresh milk' because they eat this grass, don't forget its source -grass ! ""After Lu Xiuzhen retired to Shanghai, Chi Zijian continued to contact her. As long as Chi Zijian goes to the south to participate in the pen or receive prizes, he will get off at Shanghai to visit the couple. More than ten years later, Lu Xiuzhen published a book. With the encouragement of her husband, Lu Xiuzhen returned to Harbin with a book and sent a book to friends and colleagues in person. One of them was given to Chi Zijian. On this day, after Chi Zijian happily accepted Lu Xiuzhen's book, she specially invited her ""Aunt Lu"" to ""Portman"" for Western food. During the meeting, she told Lu Xiuzhen that she has participated in novel training courses or pens for many years at the tourist resort. The most unforgettable is the first time she participated in the Xingkai Lake novel class. It seems that she really didn't forget ""grass"". As for the matter of her Mao Dun Literature Award, when she was the chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Writers Association, she did not mention it ... After listening to the story of Lu Xiuzhen's story, I finally understood what a editor should be. Do you be the one who can be a wedding dress in the mind of the author ...",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-01/14.htm,2022-04-01,Edition 14: Nightlight Cup 
Space,Slaying Phoenix Bakery,Space,"Shen Jialu's theoretically said that after the Yangtze River was banned, the Yangtze River saury could not be caught or eaten, but several old -fashioned saury noodles were still supplied. Come, the owner Wang Gu left him. Industry insiders told me that most of the saury are produced by Taihu. So good, it's better to eat phoenix fish. Thanks to these rich treasures in the water, the phoenix tail fish, which is very similar to the shape of the saury, is also elegant enough to be elegant, and it is a mission to PK with the saury. In the past, some people thought that the phoenix fish and saury were similar. When the phoenix grows, it has become a saury when it grows. This is Qi Dongye. The phoenix tailfish is also called ""phoenix"", ""鲚 鲚"" or ""catfish"", which are categories with Qisi and short jawbatches. Although the phoenix tailfish is small, the body frame is also graceful and luxurious. The body is like a small dagger, with a streamlined type, the silver lights are flickering, the mouth is scratching, the lips are bright red, the eyes are round and bright, and the poems and the distance are watery. The pectoral fins were tilted sharply and unyielding. The tail is long and elegant, until the last section of the fork, like the tail of the Phoenix. Called its phoenix fish is a sincere praise of the fisherman. As a small fish travel, phoenix fish usually travels in the sea. Every year in the late spring and early summer, they enter the river from the sea and spawn in the freshwater area where the Yangtze River and the sea meet. The phoenix fish hugged the ball to warm up, and they were eaten with floating creatures. They cleverly rotated in the ocean flow, escape the chase of the fierce people, and evolved into a huge family. The phoenix fish seems to be able to find its traces in the Dajiang River in the south, and even swim all the way to Poyang Lake. Wherever you go, the surging fish flood is formed. From March from March to October, the flood season of Phoenix is definitely the blessing of civilians. Compared with the saury, the tailfish wins in the hug of the belly, tight and fragrant, so it is also called ""grilled seed fish"" in Shanghai's population. According to Mr. Xue Liyong, ""roasting"" is the error of ""囥"" in Wu Fang's language. The correct saying should be ""ravioli fish"", and ""囥"" means ""hiding"". Most of the phoenix fish eaten by Shanghai people come from the coast of the eastern Zhejiang, and a small amount of Chongming Island. The quality caught in May and June is the highest quality. The fish seeds are tight. Gently bite it. Eating phoenix tail fish, the tightness of fish seeds is the key to judging the advantages and disadvantages. The phoenix fish is thin and bone spurs. Participate in the body of the body that burst the fish, and pour some old pump in the fish body to ""Yu"". After a few seconds, pick up, get on the table while hot, chew bone, and give wine. In the restaurant, phoenix fish is expensive than smoked fish, and the cost is placed there, and consumers can understand. Suzhou people also regard the phoenix tail fish as a treasure, and put more sugar when making brine. A while ago, I invited a few cantonese friends to dinner in the Sixteen Panel. I ordered a grilled seed fish. The firewood was piled up. There is no such thing in Lingnan. As soon as friends eat, they even claim to be beautiful. It is best not to invite northern friends to eat phoenix fish. They thought Shanghai was stingy and called a plate of kitten fish virtual stories. I do n’t know its value, and it ’s not better to eat it, just like the Suzhou people say-"" cow chew grass "". When the supply of supplies is scarce, the canned Phoenix is a pagoda -like pagoda on the counter of the food store. The pedestrian passed by, and the ""vomit water"" answered. The Shanghai people who work in other places return to Shanghai to visit relatives in Shanghai, and there will be a few cans in the backpack. When it was difficult to freeze out of the door, the fox and dog friends gathered together borrowing wine to sorrow, and they would open a bottle of phoenix tail fish. There are also a considerable part of this object of exports to make foreign exchange, which has become an appetizer on the European dining table. There are still supply in Shanghai's supermarkets, but the phoenix tail fish that is stuffed in Guangkou bottle or cans. Although the cable is clear, the taste is inferior, and it is a bit of a scum man. People from Wenzhou often put the phoenix fish in order, dried under the sun, stored in the tile tank, and can be used to boil soup or burn with pork when the green and yellow are not connected. The taste is quite good. If the phoenixes bought in the vegetable field have no seeds, the family can not help but regret the chicken ribs. Last year, I ate a catfish cake at Lu Du Hotel in Taicang, which is another way of presentation of phoenix fish. The phoenix fish goes to the keel and the intestine, chop it into mud, add egg white and a little raw powder, add salt, rice wine, white pepper powder, squeeze a little ginger juice, do not add green onion, mix clockwise clockwise clockwise clockwise clockwise Uniformly, fight for a while. Then pinch into the size of the egg, sprinkle a dry powder on the table, press the fish to make the fish round into a small round cake, and arrange it in the pan with a textual fire to the golden yellow sides. After a while, the fish cakes are too much, and there are two ways to eat. First, add a little shrimp seed soy sauce and white sugar to cook. The soup should be less, and it is also a good side dish. The second is to stir -fry a pot of wine, and cover the fish cake back to the pot, which becomes a very rustic meal. If the base is fried bamboo shoots or dried dried reeds, then the fish cake on the top must be burned. To key, the phoenix fish should be chopped finely, and the salty head must be eaten at one time. There is no regrets that the saury of the Yangtze River is not necessary, because the phoenix fish is constantly coming. Its deliciousness can make the worldly early summer plump and sweet.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-01/15.htm,2022-04-01,15 Edition: Nights Cup

The testing team of Anhui Province, Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu Province, respects and thanked Zhuge Yujie for participating in ","Li Qiang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Gong Zheng, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and mayor, went to Xuhui, Jing'an, Huangpu, Putuo, Qingpu and other areas yesterday morning to check the implementation of the second batch of regional nucleic acid screening, people's livelihood guarantee, and emergency medical treatment. , Respect and thanks to Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang, and Anhui Province's testing teams in the city. Li Qiang pointed out that the most important stage in the most vigorous prevention and control of the epidemic must be firm and uncomfortable. It is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and instructions, and go all out, do our best, and do this round of nucleic acid screening. , Strive to ensure the safety of citizens and the safety of the city. The second batch of regional nucleic acid screening work will be fully carried out on April 1, involving more personnel and wider coverage. In order to ensure the strong and orderly advancement of nucleic acid screening, relevant districts have paid close attention to the preparations of the seal control screening. Li Qiang came to a community on the South Dandan Road, Xujiahui Street, Xuhui District to check the closed management situation of the community, listened to the work reports such as residents' nucleic acid screening organization and people's livelihood security during the sealing control period, and inquire about the emergency medical ""green channel"" and personnel equipment situation. The cadres, medical staff, public security police, property security personnel, and community volunteers who adhere to the front line expressed condolences and thanks. He said that it is necessary to combine regional reality, more targeted deployment, refining the plan, and ensuring protection. It is necessary to make good use of big data, but also ""knock"" by households to ensure that nucleic acid screening is ""not leaking one household, not one person"". It is necessary to strictly control the management, control each building, patrol and every street, and ensure that the requirements of ""people are not flowing and not leaving the house"" are implemented. It is necessary to make full service guarantees, listen carefully to the residents' voices, solve the problem of urgency in a timely manner, and better consolidate the strong joint force of everyone's self -discipline and resistance. In order to speed up the detection speed of nucleic acid, a group of mobile nucleic acid detection vehicles have been put into use a few days ago. Li Qiang came to a neighborhood square in Jing'an District to learn about the surrounding residents of the mobile nucleic acid detection vehicle service, carried out the relevant situation of nucleic acid detection, and listened to the report on the improvement of the regional nucleic acid detection capacity to improve the relevant work. Li Qiang pointed out that the detection capacity of nucleic acid testing is related to the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention and control. It is necessary to focus on the current optimization of the organization, to reasonably allocate resources, promote the collaboration of the full process of ""collection, delivery, inspection, and reporting"", promote accurate matching and efficient operation; In the long run, we have worked more from the aspects of layout, equipment procurement, qualification approval, and training personnel training, and strongly support the development of relevant testing enterprises, laying a solid foundation for the convenience of citizens with the inspection. In the past few days, the brothers and cities have given strong support at a critical moment when the new round of nucleic acid screening work is promoted by the city. The testing teams of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places have arrived in Shanghai one after another. They could not take care of more, and they immediately put them into the nucleic acid sampling testing of the relevant communities. Li Qiang visited the comrades and representatives of medical staff on the spot. On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and the city, the people of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang and Anhui testing teams did not spare no effort and support for the inspection team of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. He said that in the face of the severe challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, the brothers and cities took the initiative to docking, close collaboration, watched assistance, joint defense and control, which fully demonstrated the deep friendship of the people of Shanghai. I believe that with the strength of the Yangtze River Delta and the provinces and cities across the country, we will be able to win the resistance and control of the epidemic. Li Qiang told the district and the street comrades to further strengthen the docking, communicate closely, and do a good job of service guarantee for supporting teams in other provinces and cities with their hearts and thoughtfulness. In recent days, our city has continued to strengthen the ""non -necessary non -leaving Shanghai"". From 00:00 on April 2, in addition to 48 hours of kernel acid test negative proof of kernel testing, the personnel from Shanghai must also provide anti -antigen detection negative certificates within 24 hours.

The city leaders also went to Huangpu District to inspect the social facial control and inspect the prevention and control of the epidemic and the progress of nucleic acid screening. They made a specific understanding of the completion of local conditions and comprehensive prevention and control measures to ensure that nucleic acid screening was completed on time and quality. Li Qiang pointed out that the development of nucleic acid screening is to find out the bottom number, lock risk, and cut off the spread at the fastest speed. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the grass -roots party organization's fighting fortress and the pioneering model of party members, better act on the front line of resistance, unite and lead the residents and the masses, and resolutely win the big battle of the epidemic prevention and control. Gong Zheng came to Meituan to buy Caikang Road Station. There was a bag of vegetables stacked here.

Gong Zheng is very concerned about the living security of residents in the seal and controlled area, understand the order distribution process and vegetable prices in detail, encourage enterprises to strengthen the source organizations, strengthen the distribution force, connect with the neighborhood committee and volunteers, and strengthen the self -epidemic prevention. He told the cadres in the district to protect the provision of this time an important task. It is necessary to adjust and optimize work gestures, open up the ""last mile"" to ensure that life must be sent to the house. With the comprehensive development of nucleic acid screening in Puxi, Human Village in Zhaoxiang Town, Qingpu District implemented closed management. Residents maintained interval, protecting them, and orderly nucleic acid sampling in an orderly manner. Gong Zheng looked at it and listened to the on -site organizational plan. He pointed out that the solid nucleic acid screening is related to the global resistance. It is necessary to continue to optimize on -site organizations, ensure time and time, reduce queuing time, avoid gathering conversations, and strictly prevent cross -infection. The ""easy -to -detection"" group should be included in territorial management, and the inspection should be inspected. The city leaders also came to the construction of a construction isolation and treatment point in Putuo District, and inspected the construction on the spot. Gong Zheng pointed out that it is necessary to dig up the renovation to ensure quality and safety, put it into use as soon as possible, and ensure that those with positive infections are transferred in time. After the centralized treatment point is put into operation, it is necessary to give play to the role of party members, strengthen care and care, and call on the masses to do well in self -management, enhance mutual understanding, and form a good atmosphere of ""everyone for me, I am for everyone"".

"Adult infection is transferred, who will take care of the child?","""Children's Supervisor"" and ""Children's Director"" are online",Space,"During the closing of the community, we need to strengthen care and care for special groups. How to care for the elderly and people who are in trouble for lonely widows? If the adults in the family are infected and treated, who will take care of the children of the minor? Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said that Shanghai is a city with a high degree of aging. Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, the care and service guarantee of special groups such as the elderly in the community is the top priority of our work. Recently, civil affairs departments, streets, and village commissions at all levels are also trying to do a good job of service guarantee for the special community. For elderly people who live alone, live alone, and have inconvenient actions, the community contacts the situation through telephone WeChat and other methods to understand the situation, help the elderly carry out nucleic acid test registration, and assist meals and distribution of living materials. Many ""old partner plan"" volunteers and pairing care objects pass a phone call every day to provide care and care through ""remote companion"". At the same time, for some rigid demands of the elderly in the community during the management period, such as food assistance, home care, etc., we require street towns and service agencies to do their best to provide services under the premise of strict implementation of protective measures. In addition, many districts play the dynamic information of the elderly consultant service network, timely grasp the dynamic information of groups such as elderly alone, and use the ""one -click"" information platform for the ""service for the old"" to accept the call of the elderly and their families for 24 hours. For elderly people with special requirements or difficulties, the corresponding neighborhood committees or relevant departments are coordinated and resolved. Temporary custody of children caused by the epidemic is indeed a disturbing problem. Once an adult is infected and transferred to the treatment of the epidemic, or the epidemic sealing management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them, we ask for the ""Children's Supervisor"" in the town where the children are located and the ""Children's Director"" in the village where the children are located quickly responded to Saving children's physical and mental safety as the first principle, quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. For minors suitable for home, assist in determining the appropriate caregiver and arranging temporary life care measures as soon as possible. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign special personnel to take care of them to ensure that the child is in a state of effective monitoring.

In the five venues of the district, a new round of engineering acceptance and transmission and infrastructure engineering guidance are carried out. At the same time, check the office and rest places for medical staff. ""Safety is the primary. Engineering safety, hospital sense prevention and control, personnel safety, including medical care, patients, and engineering construction personnel must ensure safety. Although tight time, difficulty, and heavy tasks, they must be sloppy. The plan is meticulous, and the work must be implemented. ""Chen Erzhen reminded all parties repeatedly. During dinner, Chen Erzhen accepted an exclusive interview with this reporter, and introduced the medical treatment and treatment plan of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered. Question: What is the treatment force of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered points? What is the condition of the ward that has been treated? Answer: As of now, the operation of this episode is generally stable. The Shanghai New International Expo Center was officially opened on the evening of March 31. Medical staff accepted the first batch of patients overnight. Under the guarantee of multi -party, the medical team of Shanghai Sixth and Tenth People's Hospital, which is stationed in the two venues of N4 and N5, accepted the ambulance that arrived at the isolation and treatment point. As of 19:00 on April 1, the venue was treated from various districts in Shanghai. 1500 patients in the county. Under the premise of ensuring the safety of patients, we are also convenient for patients. The medical team optimizes the treatment process and pays attention to details. Specifically, the ambulance that arrived at the treatment point did not line up, but the medical team took the initiative to welcome it. The medical team settled the patient first, and then handled the confirmation of relevant information. Therefore, patients are basically satisfactory. At the same time, we ask the medical team to create conditions as much as possible to meet the patient's life. Many people arrived in the middle of the night yesterday, and the treatment point also prepared rice cakes, bread and snacks for them. We also prepared a spiritual ""food"" for patients. Yesterday, the 3,000 Xinmin Evening News also sent it to the New International Expo Center to centrally isolate and collect points. So until now, patients are more recognized in all aspects. Next, the centralized isolation and treatment points of the Xin International Expo Center will steadily advance, and truly achieve the basic principles of ""separate"" and ""acceptance of acceptance"". Question: There are more than 15,000 design beds in the new International Expo Center. It is currently the largest centralized isolation point in Shanghai. What difficulties and challenges do this bring to management and operation? Answer: The site of the treatment point is very large, and the number of patients with a lot of treatment is also large. Here are including Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Longhua Hospital, Shuguang Hospital, Yueyang Hospital, Shanghai Lung Department Hospital, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Wu Guan Science Hospital, and Yangpu District Central Hospital. The medical team of ten hospitals entered, and the workload was very large. In the management of the hospital, first try to be perfect in hardware construction, and meet the equipment requirements, process requirements and technical requirements of the hospital sense prevention and control; Personnel and volunteers, etc., should improve their understanding of the importance of the hospital through training, and also improved the sense of the hospital. Question: In medical treatment, is there any plan? How will the infected people treat it here? Answer: In terms of medical treatment, the medical teams are strictly implemented based on the ""New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)"" published by the National Health and Health Commission. During the treatment process, we will further refine the plan to meet the needs of patients. We have prepared the plan to deal with patients with basic diseases and try to meet the individualized treatment needs of patients. Most of the new International Expo Center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points are asymptomatic infections. We will give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and let the infected people take some Chinese medicine. At the same time, patients with symptoms are treated with symptomatic treatment, such as cooling down. For those infected, we will conduct nucleic acid tests on the second and third days. Once the yin is transferred to meet the discharge standards, we will go through the discharge procedures. For those with mild and asymptomatic infections, this cycle is basically 7-10 days. Question: As the chief commander at the centralized isolation and treatment point at the New International Expo Center, what is the difference between the treatment of the treatment of the Third Hospital of Wuhan two years ago? Answer: At that time, we were ""foreign aid"", and this time it was ""internal rescue"". Omikon BA.2 mutant strain spreads fast and has strong communication, which also increases the difficulty of our control. However, whether in Wuhan or Shanghai, they are fighting against the epidemic. When I was in Wuhan, I said, ""I just changed my job"", so there is nothing different from nature. Question: Before, you were also responsible for many centralized isolation and treatment points. Have you accumulated some experience and brought this isolation point? Answer: The team I led has participated in the construction at the Temporary Concentration and Creating Points of the Gymnasium, Chongming Changxing Island, Jiahe Xinyuan, and Expo Exhibition Hall. From the earliest we have slowly accumulated experience, continuously summarized experience, and also learned from others. Overall, the new international expo center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points has the embodiment of previous experience. Of course, such a huge -scale treatment point is also very challenging to me, which has never been encountered before.

The direction of the peripheral queue is adjusted clockwise or counterclockwise according to the direction of the building. ""In the morning, the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the nucleic acid need to be on the south side of the test area. Entering the queue area in the direction of the clockwise direction can not only allow residents to walk less, but also ensure that residents do not go back all the way. The dynamics are more scientific and smooth. In the afternoon, the nucleic acid building is the opposite, so there are two versions of our roadmap.

The Qatar World Cup group lottery announced this morning ,"Which group of enemies are narrow, who is a horse Pingchuan ",Space ,"The World Cup is one step away -Beijing time this morning, 2022 Qatar World Cup group lottery ceremony was held at the Doghahui exhibition center. The four -year football feast, the top 32 seats are scheduled, there are ""Non -Road Road"", ""new hatred and old hate"", and ""one horse Pingchuan"". Who can kill the siege all the way and become the ultimate king? A total of 32 teams participated in the ""Death Group"", divided into 8 groups. At present, 29 participating teams have been determined, and the last three seats are generated through the playoffs in June this year. According to the latest world ranking announced by FIFA, the participating teams are divided into four gear. The host Qatar and the world's top 7 teams have become seed teams. Because Germany and Croatia have been divided into the second -level team, it is inevitable that the situation in advance in the Haoqiang group stage will occur. The ""Death Group"" of this World Cup is well deserved to belong to Group E: the two former World Cup champion teams in Germany and Spain meet the narrow road. Historically, Germany has held the Hercules Cup 4 times and the European Cup will be topped; and Spain has also made a limelight in the past ten years. In addition to the historical championship of the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, it is also picked in the European Cup three times. Kui (including the 2008 and 2012 European Cup). Judging from the current world ranking, Spain is the first group of the 7th and Germany, the first group of the championship. Their direct dialogue in the group stage will inevitably become the most exciting highlights. In the remaining several groups, there are also giants that meet, such as Group C. Argentina meets Mexico and Poland, both of which are difficult Lords. In order to attract the attention; in Group G, the five -star Brazil and Serbia, Switzerland, and Cameroon were in the same group. Serbia won the first place in Portugal in the preliminaries of the World Championship. Interestingly, after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the three teams were divided into the same group again. The host of the host is good for the 2022 World Cup. It is the first time in the World Cup football match that has been held in Qatar and the Middle East and the second time in Asia in history. In addition, the Qatar World Cup is the first World Cup held in the northern hemisphere in winter and is the first time that has never been held by a country that has never entered the World Cup finals. For Qatar, which consumes a lot of funds for and hosted, FIFA will naturally give certain ""care"". This group lottery, the signing of the Asian team is generally not good. The host is the best luck. They are divided into group A as Ecuador, Senegal, and the Netherlands. In this group, the Dutch team in the second stage has not been the same as the ""unparalleled king"" of that year, and even can only be regarded as the second -rate strong team in Europe; although Senegal is the new African Cup champion, it has also fallen seriously. This year's African region In the end, the World Policy was lucky to be lucky through penalty shootouts. As for Ecuador, Qatar was also fully capable of ingening with one. Several other Asian teams can basically say ""fate is miserable."" Whoever is in the same group with the West and Germany will become very difficult, and the Asian champion Japan will be divided into group E. Earlier, the Japanese team coach Mori Mori said that the goal of this World Cup Japanese team is to rewrite the history of the team in the World Cup. At least it has entered the top 8. At present, this goal is probably difficult to achieve. The South Korean team with Sun Xingzhang is Portugal, Ghana, and Uruguay, respectively. It can be said that the venues are tough; Saudi Arabia is surrounded by Argentina, Mexico, and Poland. The United States, I am afraid that it is not big. Therefore, the Asian team wants to perform in this World Cup, and I really have to expect to occupy Qatar, the host of the time, and the host of the time and place. As the 2019 new Asian Cup champion, they may become a capable of reaching the top 16 Asian ""independent seedlings"".

Space,Water Bian Liren to meet,Space,"Our reporter Wang Wei's Ming Dynasty was the third day of March of the lunar calendar. There may be many people now think that this is a relatively niche holiday. You must know that Le Lao's early farming society is a grand and romantic festival. Du Fu's ""Beauty Walk"" left a beautiful verse of ""New weather in March 3, Changan Water"". First, please guess the mystery: I live with the snake and hit a word. The answer is the word ""alley"". Look closely, isn't the lower half of the lane characters ""巳""? What is the ""就""? This is because the first day in early March is called ""Shangye"". Among the earthly branches, the sixth place is arranged, and the snake in the zodiac signs can be expressed. There is a legend that the Shangli Festival is a festival that originated from the emperor of Xuanyuan. According to legend, March 3 is the birthday of Huangdi, and the Central Plains region has the saying that ""February Two Dragons look up, March San Sheng Xuanyuan"". There is also a legend. In the ancient Spring and Autumn Period, the Han nation had the custom of sacrifice to the ominous riverside in riverside. The bathing activities held in the early March of the spring, so the Shangjie Festival was also called ""Spring Bath Day"". Everyone believes that bathing this day can eliminate the disease and clean the body and mind, called ""祓禊"". In the period of Le Wei and Jin dynasties, the upper festival gradually evolved into the festival of the royal nobles and literati, and there was another important custom of the Shangjie Festival -Qu Shui Liu Yan. Everyone sat on the edge of the water, laid the water on the water of the full wine, and let it drift in the water. In front of anyone, anyone would pick up the wine glass to drink and give a poem, otherwise a penalty would be punished. Wine three cups. The most famous ""Qu Shui Liu Yan"" activity in history is to count the Lanting rally held by Wang Xizhi and his friends. Wang Xizhi has become a ""Lanting Collection"", which has made a book with a good book, has been well -known, well -known in the world, and praised by future generations. In China, there are several Daughter Days. On the third day of March, the third day of the lunar calendar, the Dragon Boat Festival in May, and the seventh day of July, it is called Daughter's Day. Therefore, the Shangyi Festival is also the Daughter's Day. The little girl put on beautiful clothes, faced the water, and danced. According to legend, the ancient Han girls generally held adult gifts on this day, called ""Li Li"". 发 发 is the sister -in -law used in ancient times. Since it is Daughter's Day, the female red is unable to take off. In the Songjiang area of Logu, Gu Xiu has always been an essential homework for daughters. Dance of the needle tip into the embroidery, reflecting the girl's heart and cleverness. Until now, as the Sanxin School of Songjiang District, which is a non -heritage campus in Shanghai, has also specially opened a Guxiu interest class to make this national intangible cultural heritage carry forward. Interestingly, Shangxian Festival is also one of the major Valentine's Day in China. On the third day of March of the lunar calendar, the spring flowers bloom, and the long warbler flying is the best period for men and women to date. ""The Book of Songs · Zheng Feng · ·"" describes the scene of young men and women in March, the young men and women, and the spring on the shore of the water. The poem reads: ""Victoria and Women, Yi Qisha, gives it a spoon."" If a single man and woman are in love, they will give each other with peony or orchid grass, which will form a ""peony to set love"" to reserve programs. The ""medicine"" in peony is ""appointment"", and peony has become a symbol of love between men and women. Therefore, the upper festival can be called the most orthodox and oldest Valentine's Day in China. The president of Zhongfulan Shanghai Folk Culture Society, Le Primitive Society. The most basic spiritual activity of people is primitive worship. In order to survive, people in ancient society carefully avoided many disasters and derived many taboos. These taboos played a role in the formation of festival customs. For example, every spring is the season when the plague is easy to be popular. People take epidemic prevention. This is the origin of the Lunar March 3rd. Bi Xuling's folk customs of the Institute of Literature of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and the director of the non -heritage research office of the ancient dragon mother accidentally conceived the legend of the dragon by the river, which has something to do with the Shangxun festival customs. There are two indispensable things ""water"" and ""foreign body"" in the typical plot of Dragon Mother. According to legend, the activities of this day of Shangyi Festival are mainly Laeheh and Lakes. Young men and women give each other gifts, which has the meaning of seeking puppets, sons, and life.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-02/12.htm,2022-04-02,12 Edition: Our holiday: Our festival
Space,Spring Tea,Space,"The medicine collection is planned according to the original plan. At this time, I should experience new tea before the Qianshan Tea Garden. Unexpectedly, the epidemic and ""Chun Chun Cold"" arrived at the same time, and going out to be difficult. As a result of a partner, he was very open -minded: ""Since you can't get to the"" Mingqian "", change the"" after the rain ""!"" The new tea this season will take about a few days to drink. However, I have always liked Chen Cha, and I have a lot of time at home. I took out the smoky Chen tea of my relatives' own self -proclaimed and made a pot. I experienced the spring meaning of ""senior"" in the back of Gan Gan. The habit of drinking Chen tea was developed by a teenager. I remember that before going to school every day, my mother took Chen Cha's pottery pot and was filled with a large tin pot after cooling. Let me go to school to drink. She also said that children should not drink new tea and hurt the stomach. In fact, the content of tea polyphenols in new tea is high and stimulated. The mother's practice is an experience. The amount of exercise in school is large, and the water is much more water. It is inevitable to raise my hands several times in the class, so often criticize the teacher. Later, I read the ""Children's Miscellaneous Poems"" in Zhitang, and there was a song: ""Bring a teapot to the school, and the book is not cooked. Essence It seems that the students in the Sanyi Book House also tasted the three flavors of tea drinking. It is no wonder that Zhitang could write an excellent sentence such as ""drinking together with two or three people for half a day, can reach the dream of ten years"". What is good for Zhitang is ""Qingquan Green Tea"", which is the authentic tea. Liu Yuxi's ""Xishan Lan Ruo Test Tea Song"" wrote: ""Mountain monk back eaves of tea, spring and bamboo pumping new fluff. From the side of Fang Fang, the eagle is picked up. Sterees are frying into a full -room fragrance, so you can build the golden sand water. ""It is recorded that the mountain monks fry the new tea for guests, which is extremely vivid. From the perspective of the verse, only the process of fried greens, without fermentation, the taste is very simple. Fortunately, the owner of Lan Ruo specializes in the ""eagle mouth"" ordinary leaf. It is quite appropriate to come. Once drinking tea has become a habit, it is difficult to change. This in the Tang Dynasty has already experienced it -half a century before Liu Yuxi wrote this poem, Tang Dezong began to levy tea tax, and he received 400,000 consistently that year. As many, Liu Yuxi's friend Bai Juyi also has a famous sentence that ""businessmen heavy litter to leave, buying tea to go in the previous month"". It can be seen that at that time, tea was not unpredictable, but part of most people's lives. Hobbies and life were originally two very different tastes. Although I drink tea since I was a child, I didn't like to go to Chashan for a time. I always thought that the tea garden was a very boring place. It takes a long time to gain a lot, often frustrating. Until one time I sent the old relatives to return to my hometown, coincided with the harvest of spring tea, relatives put down their luggage, and took out the bamboo baskets and went straight to the Chashan. Embroidery and string, quickly pick the tender sprouts of tea leaves, and said in my mouth, ""This tea is the same as children. It looks like a day. If you don't quickly pick it off, delay the time, it is a waste of God's hard work!"" Holding the bamboo basket for her, listening to her fluff, feeling the spring breeze in the tea garden, the birds were making trouble, and suddenly the tea tree in the tea garden had a good impression on the tea tree without flowers and no flowers. Maybe what really moved me was the elderly That's true that it is not violated. From the tea garden, the old man had to send me a can of homemade tea, and also emphasized that the tea was smoked and ""not dry"". Shengyi was difficult, I had to accept it, and I didn't care too much at that time. After that, I accidentally put a pot, which not only had mellow taste, but also with the unique smoky taste of local tea. ""Addicted. I can't say what I remember, whether it is tea, or the simple and warm taste when I was a teenager. It is more than half of this spring, and the tea trees in the tea garden may not have to wait any longer. I hope this wave of ""Chun Chun Cold"" has passed earlier.

Space,Cherish resources,Space,"There are many types of Chongming cakes, Ningbo rice cakes, and local cakes stored in the New Year in Nanni refrigerator. After freshness, the frozen components of the refrigerator are frozen in the freezer of minus 18 degrees Celsius. Before the arrival of Qingming, he must have threw it mostly. Today, when bread is not so convenient for breakfast, it is the same. The good taste of food is still that taste. The Chongming cakes of the walnut red dates are full of small bags and put them in a small bag. Name, how many good things are wasted! I can't help but think of a interesting smell: a foreign tramp who specializes in expired food, nothing wrong. Opened a half -box biscuit jar, ate one -third of the walnuts and sesame powder, a bag of blueberry nuts oatscisy, the remaining 3 Taiwanese sun cakes, and the green tea that was two years. The oolong tea that has expired this year, several apple oranges that are dying ... suddenly appeared in front of you with a new and precious face. In the name of love in the name of life, we don't tired of eating, and well -known modern and efficient life, we are actually a lot of waste. ""Buy, buy and buy!"" ——Taishan and arrogance replaced the softness and convergence of food. The epidemic allows us to realize that cherishing resources is necessary. ""Squeezing"" -The medical resources are afraid of ""extrusion"", and do not go to ""crowding"". ""Squeeze"" is an unsafe vocabulary. Is it a word that is a word that should be criticized as a safe and not morality as the opposite side of the crowding. Another level of cherishing resources is to cherish the friendship you value. In the past, many of the social interactions were actually invalid social. The so -called party has a self -release of the joy of gathering joy, and the interaction of friendship is heating up, but why not include social politeness and the burden of entertainment, why not include the flow of gossip and discussion right and wrong. ""Wine and meat friend"", —— wine and meat can not produce friends. Real friends, he will always be in your heart. That is just right. I haven't met in the same city for ten years, but once you need it, he immediately responds. Once you meet, just broke up yesterday. Being able to withstand loneliness can also have profound friendship. Growing up secretly can we appreciate each other. I feel that the novel ""Flower Flowers"" is good, and the word ""not sounds"" has stirred the countless joy, feelings, reflection, and inquiry of people. It is still an Internet celebrity. Do not sound when you do n’t speak, and do n’t sound when you should sound; do n’t sound when you are embarrassed, and even more when you are proud; do not sound when hearing the gossip, and you do n’t sound That is to be good at being a person. Real humor is waiting for the conscience. True learning is used for self -appreciation. Real friendship seems to be forgotten. I thought of the word waste. Some waste will be extremely praised. He can borrow you hundreds of thousands of RMB to buy a house, and you don't borrow it. She can arrange your child to enter her company, and you didn't find it. Senior seniors can promote your promotion, but you just nodded. If the resources you care about, if it is a real pure spirit, you must allow it to be wasted by the material form.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-02/14.htm,2022-04-02,14th edition: Nightlight Cup
"In the first quarter of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, there was a significant adjustment","Don't panic, spring is approaching!",Space,"Affected by the epidemic in 2020, the performance of listed companies is not good. In 2021, the performance of listed companies has increased significantly. If the data of listed companies in 2021 is used, the actual price -earnings ratio is estimated to be about 11 times. Judging from the 2021 annual report is currently disclosed, listed companies have good performance. As of March 30, 877 companies released the 2021 annual report. The total net profit of these companies in 2021 was 223.11 billion yuan, an increase of 19%year -on -year. If the company that has already released performance expressions and the release of performance forecasts, calculated based on the lower limit of the performance forecast, 3410 companies achieved a total net profit of 3351.9 billion yuan in 2021, an increase of 27%year -on -year. Obviously, the performance increase of listed companies in 2021 should reach double digits. In this way, the current A -shares, regardless of the price -earnings ratio or the net net ratio, are at the bottom of history. Most institutions believe that the current A shares enter the bottom area. Last week, Shen Wanhongyuan held the ""Thirty Years of Entering the New Economy"" through the Internet platform -the capital market spring strategy meeting. Shi Wanhongyuan studied the chief analysis master of A -share strategy, Jingtao, said: The A -share market has ""bathing"" and is ""reborn"". The long -term cost performance of the market low in mid -March can be compared with several historical outsoles. We are ushered in the bottom area of a large band, and the bottom of the big bottom corresponds to big opportunities, but the process of getting out of the outsole is often twists and turns. Still that sentence: Winter is here, will spring be far away?",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-02/15.htm,2022-04-02,15th edition: Xinmin Finance
Space,"""Policy bottom"" has now ""market bottom"" still needs to be consolidated",Space,"Since the bottom of the A -share smashing out on March 16, the Shanghai -Shenzhen stock market has entered a large box of composition in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in the past half a month. With the ceiling, the floor of the GEM index is between 2764 and 2462 points. The policy bottom is clear, and the real market bottom is to get out of the box interval at the bottom. To get out of this bottom interval and turn the bottom of the policy into a real market bottom, this requires a series of conditions to cooperate. These conditions are nothing more than the following: First, the market needs time for space. The bottom is piled up by funds. As far as the current cabinet is concerned, because the various indexes have been in the market for average shareholding costs over the past year, their amplitude is almost less than 300 points below the annual line. There are little on the profit tray. Basically, the holding of the shareholding is a lingering disk. This part of the holdings of the holding of the market is relatively impetuous, hesitating when it falls, and fled when it falls. It is carried out in the atmosphere, so it takes time to repair the market, and the loosening of the meat plate is needed, so that the stock price can consolidate the bottom. Second, the bottom of the secondary market also needs to reduce the impulse of endless money in the first -level market. In recent years, the high premium issuance of the first -level market has become a market form. The new shares of the Shanghai and Shenzhen cities are only two or three in 10,000. The reason why the winning rate of new shares is so low is exactly related to the issuance method. The chips of tens of millions of shares in a small company are placed in the huge market to grab it. The value of coming comes is bound to be undertaken by the secondary market. This is the current trend of breaking the phenomenon and the long -term opening of the stock price after listing. More than ten years ago, the GEM trend and the market for the market. The high premium is better than that of more than 10 years ago, so the bottom of the market will need to cooperate at the bottom of the market in the future. The issuance price of the new shares of the Bei Stock Exchange is continuously declining, which is the result of the game of market investors and financiers. Third, the composition of the market at the bottom of the market must be supported by macro fundamentals in the final analysis. This year's economic layout has been established, and the economic development goals determined by the government work report have been decomposed into various regions and departments. In this decomposition plan, we have seen that in September this year The Pingzhong Fund is a profitable information for the market. The goal of this year's GDP growth is set to 5.5%year -on -year. This should be said to be a very good goal at the moment. But the future is bright and the road is twists and turns. To achieve these goals, you need to make great efforts. At present, to what extent the development of the economy needs to be observed. Therefore, compared with the previous bottom building, this wave of bottom -up market has never been seen before. The reason is very simple. There may be more problems in Lin's big market, so the expectations of this wave of bottom -up market should still be more patient. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Index 3279 points are the ceiling of the bottom interval. It is not considered to be out of the bottom of this ceiling. Only when this ceiling is stepped under the foot to become the floor of the next box, this is the real sense of getting out of the bottom. The stock market is new. In the current market, investors still have to be patient to maintain the strength of their own funds. If there is a large market in the future, it means that the same funds can buy more stock chips, and wait patiently in the box finishing market. At the time of the breakthrough, choose the existing stock in your own hand, fall back and forth, or short -term supplementation or low suction and high throwing. This is also a way to play a game.

World Expo Fang Cabin Hospital sent away eligible discharge in batches today,"""I have defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!""",Space,"Cabbage, discharged! Shanghai's first COVID-19 patients with mild patients and asymptomatic infected World Exhibition Center Hospital have been running for a week. From today, the qualified discharge will be sent in order here. These courtyards will be returned to the land by various districts and strictly do health management. The infected person tells that peace of mind isolation treatment Active volunteer service on March 23. The 34 -year -old Mr. Wang's family of three and his parents were notified to receive centralized isolation observations. ""I was notified abnormally during the hospital test at the hospital. At that time, my wife, 8 -month -old child, and parents and elderly people could not be released."" I don't know how it is my turn. The unit leader called him to let him relax, do not have ideological burdens, and receive treatment with peace of mind. All units in the family will find ways to solve it. Mr. Wang was relieved, and was sent to the World Expo Card on the 26th to treat the area under the jurisdiction of the medical team of Renji Hospital. Mr. Wang is a member of the Communist Party of China. He holds the idea of ""good deeper"". He said that he had to work hard to ""turn overcast"" and return to his family as soon as possible. ""The first time to sleep with so many people is definitely not used to it, but the bed, quilt, and various living items are brand new, and the environment is relatively clean. Men, don't pay attention to so much."" Here, Mr. Wang said he said he After living a nursing home -like life, three meals a day can be delivered, and you can come again if you are not enough; if you have nothing to do, video with your family, and occasionally deal with some units' work contact matters. In the square cabin, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine was fully exerted, and he also took everyone with everyone. Except for eating, he usually wore a mask, including sleeping without taking off. ""I think everyone does this, it seems to be very common, and I am not particularly uncomfortable, just get used to it."" There is a activity area in the square cabin hospital. When the sun was exposed, the pressure was gone when the mind was empty. Mr. Wang also saw an initiative of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee from the mobile phone. He said that his party was 10 years old and his body was uncomfortable. He could stand up to serve everyone. As a result, he became an active volunteer to help nurses distribute three meals and bottled water, carry materials, and coordinate the living needs of nearby personnel. ""Da Bai wants to take care of so many people in us. It is very hard. We can help us, find something to do, and the time has passed soon."" In the area where he lives, everyone is happy to serve others. Mr. Wang Laughingly, there were several late time, and they did not grab the volunteers. They could only ""enjoy"" the services of others. The biggest difficulty is that the hardware conditions are limited. The shower facilities cannot be converted here. You can only wash it with hot water. Fortunately, washing and going to the toilet are more convenient, and they do not need to be lined up. Others are also very modest. Seeing someone in the back, I always speed up and avoid others for too long. From the beginning of the tension to the later relief, Mr. Wang said that this was the first provenance of him and the virus; and the two nucleic acid detection negatives intervals 24 hours a day was his long -awaited victory. ""I defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!"" Last night, he had sorted out his personal items and will be arranged by the vehicle in the area. ""I miss it home. The first thing to go back is to take a bath."" Mr. Wang thanked the Renji Medical Team who took care of him. He said that the family members are currently nucleic acid detection negative and everything is good. Looking at it, each experience has harvested, and the special ""collective life"" is also a different experience. The chief commander tells the difficulties that we have worked together to work together in the World Expo Hospital where Mr. Wang is located. As of yesterday, more than 7,100 mild patients and asymptomatic infections were accepted. Ji Hospital, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Tongji Hospital, Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, and Shanghai Children's Medical Center. The interim party committee and temporary party branch have been established here. Zheng Junhua, chief commander of the World Cabin Hospital and Secretary of the Party Committee of Renji Hospital, told reporters that according to the characteristics of the mutant strains of Omiko, most people can transfer to the yin to go home after 7 to 10 days. Starting today, those who meet the discharge standards will be discharged in batches and districts. ""We have strictly compared one by one in accordance with national standards. It requires two negative interval time for nucleic acid to require more than 24 hours. For three consecutive days of body temperature, there is no symptoms of respiratory tract. In the end, we set the first list."" The personnel are involved in multiple districts in the city. They have completed docking and confirmed with various districts yesterday. These personnel are managed by the territory and coordinated by the territorial coordinated vehicles to take them back properly. In terms of discharge management, the Shanghai Municipal Government has established a comprehensive coordination of special classes. If the residence meets the home isolation conditions, it can carry out 7 days of health management at home; if the family's own conditions do not have it, the accommodation arrangement will be implemented by the local area. As these groups of personnel have left one after another, completing the disinfecting work, a group of new personnel will be ushered in. Zheng Junhua said that the first time to set up a square -cabin hospital infected in Shanghai for the first time, it is completely different with the scene where he took the city's first support for the Hubei medical team to Wuhan in 2020, so this time you can only improve while doing it. From the beginning, it can be improved. From the beginning The running -in period, when the improvement period, and reaching the improvement period, cannot be separated from the joint efforts of everyone. At the same time, the medical needs and life needs of more than 7,000 people are facing very large pressure. ""It is definitely better to stay at home, and it will always exist."" Zheng Junhua hopes to tell everyone that isolation is temporary. As long as everyone can cooperate with the prevention and control strategy and respond positively and optimistic, they can soon go home.

Space,"Inspiration is constantly ""resistant to episodes"" bright moves",Space,"Yesterday, our reporter from the ""New 36 Anti -Epidemic 36 Plan"" collected by the city's anti -epidemic front -line was published, which brought new ""inspiration"" to many first -tier anti -epidemic workers. They were practical tricks. Today, let's take a look at what they have. The 7th ""Artifact"" QR code ""Batch generation"" is in Dongqi Village, Lingtang Town, Qingpu District, and nearly two -thirds of the villagers are elderly people over 60 years old. They are not good at using smart devices and need staff to help enter healthy cloud nucleic acid registration information. In order to improve efficiency, the ""post -90s"" guy Li Sichun thought of a good way -he used his professional learning to write a two -dimensional code batch of appointments based on the population information table. Each person's appointment registration information only takes 40 seconds You can generate up to 100 pieces at most, which is not only efficient, but also avoids the problem that the elderly's information may be errors in the village committee staff. Using this program, only one staff member, plus three computers can operate at the same time, can generate more than 1,400 appointment codes in the village within 5 hours. At present, nearly a hundred villages in Qingpu, Jiading, Minhang, Pudong and other areas have also begun to use this program, which greatly improves the efficiency of nucleic acid screening information registration. Our reporter Yang Huan No. 8 Before the ""dark box"" was simplified, how to quickly scan the appointment of the nucleic acid detection and register the two -dimensional code before the ""dark box"" was checked by the ""dark box""? Yesterday, the reporter found in the Green Home District of Jinhui Town, Fengxian District that the nucleic acid testing team here uses a homemade ""dark box"". This ""dark box"" is a rectangular ""sunroof"" cut out of the top, and a convenient noodle box on the side is cut around. In the bright spring light, the residents stretched the mobile phone from the side of the cut, and as the volunteer scanned the terminal with the hand -scan terminal, they could be retrieved. According to the volunteers at the scene, this ""dark box"" was made a few days ago. Prior to this, they found that although most residents took screenshots in advance and registered the QR code of nucleic acid testing, when the light outside was too strong, the screen of the mobile phone was relatively dark. The QR code on the screen was not easily scanned by the terminal-- Sometimes it takes more than ten consecutive times to succeed. And such a self -made ""dark box"", the light inside is not as strong as the outside. This is much bright in the mobile phone screen in it. In order to adjust the light in the ""dark box"" to a better level, and to better check the handheld terminal screen, they also gave a ""dark box"" and a handheld terminal. They said that now they are basically accurate, fast and safe. Our reporter Luo Shuiyuan's 9th efficient bright code brush ID card as a nucleic acid. According to the proposal made by the citizens through the public adoption of the ""Special Solid in the Epidemic Prevention and Control Work"" channel, the citizens will not operate the elderly in the nucleic acid detection. The prominent problem of dilemma, Jiangpu Road Street, Yangpu District contacted a technology company to emergency research and development, and draw on the practice of brushing ID cards at the high -speed rail station to enter the station to drive. Essence ""Intelligent nuclear detection"" looks like a POS machine. As long as the elderly put the ID card, the device can intelligently recognize it, and automatically access the ""Healthy Cloud"" applet to generate a two -dimensional code for nucleic acid testing and printed. Jiangpu Road Street has piloted in several communities, which is very convenient for the elderly and has accelerated the speed of nucleic acid detection. After that, the street will continue to optimize the network stability of the device to promote this practice larger. Our reporter Sun Yun's 10th ""magic box"" emergency material faction field in the past few days, in the Pushan residential area of Jijiangxi Road Street, Jing'an District, a suitcase called ""Baibao Box"" is a bit busy: it follows The staff of the residential area ""Da Xian's skills"" came to the scene of the epidemic prevention and control again -this is the emergency of protective clothing, goggles, gloves, masks, disinfection and disinfection plants such as the deployment and requirements of the residential area according to the street deployment and requirements of the residential area. Materials, it can come in handy. It is understood that there are 7 staff members of the Pu Shan residential area, but there are 14 sets of protective suits prepared by Zhang Lei, the general branch of the residential district party -the first night of the first day of the sealing and control notification, rushed to the scene to cooperate with the seal control measures When the property company staff saw the community staff all armed, but when they had only one mask, Zhang Lei opened the trolley case and handed protective equipment to the property staff who needed to work in the building. The children of a family have a high fever and need to be sent to the hospital for treatment. The two sets of protective equipment of the ""Baibao Box"" are used again. Before 120 arrived, let the children and mothers protect them early, and they were sent to relevant hospitals for a moment. Our reporter Jiang Yuezhong's 11th anti -""leakage"" in the field of real -time form WeChat filling nucleic acid detection data can be made clear to ensure that one is not omitted? Wen Hai, a volunteer volunteer in the seaside New City Community of Shanyang Town, Jinshan District, is a teacher of the Mengshan Middle School Information Department. He summarizes the experience of previous volunteer services. He believes that the selection of this tradition will increase the work pressure of later data. Therefore, on the evening of March 29, Wen Hai used his own director to design and produce a WeChat real -time table overnight, including the community building number and room number of the community. Set the point to perform online registration. On the morning of March 30, the Eastern District of the Seaside New Town took the lead in implementing a dynamic monitoring of real -time tables. Residents find that they can open the form at home and simultaneously know the inspection progress of other corridors, which is very convenient; on -site volunteers have found that they can understand the detection status at the scene in real time to facilitate the next corridor for testing. For the volunteers of the building, this form is also very helpful, which can understand the situation of the detection site in real time, and facilitate dynamic adjustment of the scanning speed. The cadres of the neighborhood committee also believe that this real -time data can greatly improve the work efficiency of the presidential plan. The newspaper correspondent Liu Shihan Reporter Tu Yu's 12 ""Flowing Water"" combat hand -painted ""sampling process"" Tu Minhang District Maqiao Town Party Committee Qi Yuanyuan constantly explored and handed 6 sampling flowcharts, which clearly marked the sampling moving line, Each link and corresponding functions and precautions. Staff can rank according to the figure and perform their duties, so that the samples are as efficient and smooth as the ""flow line"". According to the flowchart, in terms of personnel configuration, it is usually configured with 2-3 volunteers in one station. Medical staff is only responsible for sampling links. Other codes scanning, cotton-dismantling, and samples are put into test tubes. — Relevant volunteers receive standardized training in the early stage. One process and 1 person are completed. At one time, it can save almost 2-3 seconds, one or two thousand copies a day, and the time to save is considerable. 70 medical staff can complete the sampling volume of 50,000 people in one day. According to the flowchart, the Xia Duoyuan community in Maqiao Town also created its own ""hand shape"" moving line, that is, the orderly arrangement of residents to queue in the ""arm"" in batches, and arrange volunteers to scan the code to verify it at the ""wrist"". Subsequently diverted to the ""fingers"" at the ""finger"" to complete the test before leaving, avoiding entry and exit flowing, preventing personnel agglomeration, and improving the sampling efficiency. After the closed -loop management of Judura, many young volunteers took the initiative to report to the residential village committee. They were arranged in the QR code verification area to perform mobile phone operations for residents who did not register, and scanned the code for the registered residents to ensure that 10 people in the testing team quickly turned around. Volunteers also DIY the shading carton to avoid the failure of the mobile phone to scan the mobile phone due to sunlight.

The 10 -year -old girl at home was always at home because of her negativeness. After seeing the video, send the information for ""helping Nong"". After receiving the help, the reporter contacted the girl's parents and neighborhood committees. ""The news is not real. Although both of our husband and wife are isolated, the school and the neighborhood committee have always been concerned about their children."" The emotional at home is low. ""Chen Chen is indeed alone at home."" Essence Girl Dad, Mr. Wang, told reporters that because the couple were diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, they had been collected uniformly on March 28. If they took the child to focus on the treatment point, they were worried that the child would be infected. Therefore, only the daughter was at home. Mr. Wang said: ""Because the parents are not around, and because of worrying about her infection, her daughter has really been a bit low in these days. However, the description in the video is inaccurate. A lot of it. ""The netizens who asked"" helping Nong ""also called the reporter to call the reporter. When he contacted the Douyin account on the 1st to ask about the situation, the Douyin account said solved. In order to further understand the situation every day, the reporter contacted Chen Chen's class teacher Dai. ""She is usually a well -behaved and sensible child."" Teacher Dai told reporters that since the girl's parental nucleic acid detection is abnormal, she maintains communication with her children every day. When her parents were not sent to the concentrated collection point, she and her parents were separated by two bedrooms. I followed up to understand the changes in my family every day. Starting this Monday, her parents left home. I will talk to her on WeChat every day, or ask audio calls to ask her needs and mood. Last week, her antigen self -test was positive, but she was tense. Fortunately, the result of nucleic acid review detection is negative. ""The reporter also learned from the neighborhood committee where Chen Chen's family was located that since Chen Chen's parents were sent to centralized isolation, Chenchen was included in the community's focus on the target of concern."" The 10 -year -old girl is alone at home, plus due to the entire building. They are all closed and managed, and we are also worried about her safety and worry about whether she can take care of himself. ""Teacher Tang, the person in charge of the neighborhood committee, said that on the one hand, the staff of the neighborhood committee communicated with Chenchen through WeChat every day to ask Chenchen's needs. In order to let Chen Chen and Chen Chen's parents feel at ease, a few days ago, they also contacted the professionals to come to do the home environment. ""Thank you for the neighborhood committee and the school, thanks to their care. ""Chen Chen's father, who is still in the isolation point, told the reporter on the phone. At the press conference of the 141st COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in Shanghai held yesterday, Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, emphasized that the epidemic situation emphasized that It may lead to temporary care of children. Once adults are infected and transferred, or the epidemic seal control management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them. Children's director ""responded quickly to ensure the physical and mental safety of the child as the first principle, and quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. If it is a minor suitable for home, to assist in determining the appropriate caregiver as soon as possible and arrange temporary care measures. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign a special person to take care of it to ensure that the child is in an effective monitoring state. Both parents like Chenchen COVID-19 have only one family who has been trapped away. Teacher Tang said that because Chenchen is the secret of positive patients, in the past two days, the town is also coordinating whether Chenchen can be transferred to the town to transfer to the town. There is a close -up isolation point for special personnel, and there is finally news on April 1. ""There is an isolation point for Chen Chen. If Chen Chen was unwilling to go to the isolation point, the street also applied for Dabai special care, and she could come to care and take care of her. In addition, the neighborhood committee also coordinated a doctor to adopt a nucleic acid for Chenchen to help her relieve her tension. ""However, as of the press time, Chen Chen's parents were not adapted because their daughters were not adapted to the strange environment, and they were worried that the strange Dabai special care came to the door to cause the child to be nervous.

Shanghai Police reminds: citizens shall cooperate with nucleic acid sampling detection,Uncontrolled inspection will be handled according to law,Space,"On the morning of April 1st, a scene occurred in a community in Songjiang District: According to the unified arrangement of the street, the residents organized residents to conduct nucleic acid testing. Because of the trouble of trouble, the resident Yan Mou turned a blind eye to the detection notification, but the door was closed. Essence When the staff came to the door many times, Yan came to the scene, but deliberately presented the two -dimensional code of the WeChat business card to the sampling person. When he was asked to show the healthy cloud QR code, he forcibly broke through the staff to stop the staff and returned home by himself. It seriously affects the normal development of the testing work. After receiving the alarm, the police of the Songjiang Public Security Branch rushed to the scene to deal with it, urging Yan Mou to take the investigation after completing the nucleic acid test, and recently imposed administrative penalties for it according to law. In fact, on March 27, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government issued the ""Notice on Doing a Good Affairs of the City in the City"", and carried out a new round of cut -type and grid nucleic acid screening in the city. The general public is required to support understanding and cooperation with the city's epidemic prevention and control work. In accordance with the requirements of the street community or unit of the street, the nucleic acid screening is orderly. For the test of nucleic acid testing for unified organizations without justified reasons, which hinders the prevention and control of the epidemic or cause other serious consequences, the Shanghai Public Security Organ will give public security management punishment in accordance with the relevant provisions of the People's Republic of China on Public Security Management Punishment of the People's Republic of China; if a crime constitutes a crime, in accordance with "" The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China is investigated for criminal responsibility.

Space,How to open spring,Space,"◆ Zhou Limin's tea plums, laughing, peach blossoms, and cherry blossoms are open for the second time. We have to learn to accept the gifts of heaven and earth, whether it is the beauty of spring or snow. At the moment when life slowed down due to the epidemic, the heart also calmed down, opening the spring in reading, and it was a choice to adapt to local conditions. The ""most meaningful book"" book is vast. Which waves belong to us? It happens that there is a book list issued by Garcia Marquez on hand. A magazine solicited ""five most meaningful books for you"", this is his answer: ""One Thousand and One Nights"", ""Odipus"" in Somerus, ""White Whale"" in Melville's ""White Whale"" ""Collection of Spanish lyrics"" and ""Spanish Dictionary"". At first he wanted to include ""Earl of Christ"", but later he felt that there was already ""Oedipus King"" Pearl Yu; he thought of ""War and Peace"". I also feel that this is well known. The ""White Whale"" ""disorderly structure has created one of the most beautiful chaos in literature"" has not been recognized, and it is even more recommended. The book of forty years ago came from ""Painless Literature"", which was collected in Marquez's collection of ""Back to Seeds"" (translated by Tao Yuping, January 2022, Nanhai Publishing Company). This book also accepted a lot of social reports written by many old horses as journalists, which is comparable to detective novels and fascinating. Therefore, I did not hesitate to include this book in my spring book. When it comes to ""the most meaningful book"", I can't help but think of the classic works of classic writers. The book is not afraid of old, and prefers to meet again and again. In recent years, many publishing houses have launched many kindergarty and simple masterpieces. The first series of ""Wenjing | Scholars"" launched by Wenjing in Century Wenjing includes ""Resurrection"", ""Dece's Tess's Tess"", ""Castle"", ""Sahalin Travel"", ""The Ball of the Lamb"", ""The Red Cavalry Army"" (the people of Shanghai Publishing House, January 2022) and other famous books, and also equipped with contemporary writers' guide; the youth version of the brand book ""Everyone's Little Book"" of Beijing Publishing House also added world masterpieces. ""Hunter Note"", Xiaoqiao Ben is also loved. The free mind will not be imprisoned. Reading can take us to the distance. Recently, I have read Chekhov's ""Sahalin Travels"". Those places that may not be able to go in a lifetime, open the book in front of me. There are three books of the peach blossoms of the readers: ""My Mountain Animals Commercial"", ""Those Shining Days in Life"", ""Peach Tree Family: The Time of Reading Family"" (Beijing Times Chinese Book Bureau October 2021), I suddenly picked the last book that Zhu Tianwen, Zhu Tianxin, and Zhu Tiaoyi, was because of the spring atmosphere such as ""Tao Shushu"". This book is also realistic. There are two peach trees in the backyard of the Zhu family, planting vegetables and flowers, and also connected with hillside. ""Watching peach blossoms in March, picking peaches in May, making ice peach soup. In June, the flowers bloom ... September osmanthus ..."" (Zhu Tianwen: ""Peach Tree Family"") Sometimes the mother will take them to Dongshan Gang to use Bloody, ""Looking through the river valley, the mountains are silver flowers, shaking wild manges."" (Zhu Tianwen: ""Spring Shirt"") Is this peach blossom source? How can there be a peach blossom source in the world. Their material life is actually very nervous. However, ""readers"", poverty -stricken talked, and beating with nature and small animals, everything has become the ""best time."" Zhu Tianwen is greedy for typhoon, the power outage, the parents do not do anything, a family of five people is on the big bed in the hall, and the parents are chatting freely. The children are playing on the side ... In the long years, happiness may not come from In the material barrier, it is a kind memory of this normal life. I feel how important it is in the new book ""One Cave of the Studio"" (Writer Press, January 2022). The studio ""has a hole in the same private, the same freedom of the home, the magical of the immortal"", and the painting is ""the expression and expression of more people's soul."" (""The Story of the Studio"") Following Mr. Feng's text and a lot of pictures, I hit a roller on the grass of art. I also especially like the corridor of Mr. Feng's studio and outside the study. (""Chair in Lianlang"") The feeling here is not that spring is coming, but the four seasons are like spring. There is no poem to bring the spring back, how can it be worthy of this green and fat. Mr. Huang Yongyu's Poetry Collection ""See Smile Collection"" (illustration version, writer publishing house) met us this season, and more than 170 illustrations explained what ""poetic and painting"" is. The spring in his writing is the ""green"" of the hometown of Nanhua Mountain: ""The green is so embarrassed,/the green is so repeated,/the green can't breathe ..."" (""South Hua Cui"") Spring, we must listen carefully: ""Spring is here, big trees and small trees start to grow buds/Fortunately, they don't laugh, otherwise/noise during the day and night."" (""Spring"") This is the ""Spring Voice of Spring"" of a ninety -eight -year -old man, this It is the green text of returning to the old. In the early morning, it was really ""noisy"". It was a bird's sound of thousands of turns, closing his eyes, listening silently, and also wonderful music. ""The most popular voice in the world is the whisper of this bird."" A gentleman in the British countryside thought so 254 years ago. (See Gilbert White: ""The History of Sel Peng Nature"", p. 97, Miao Zhe, December 2021 Edition) Turn over his ""History of Sel Peng Nature"", how many urban people ignite again The dream of seclusion in the country. In the spring, in the wild, ""Overlooking the spring in the distance,/袅/cooking smoke -Is it/the girls who are cooking on the spring wild/picking the wedding dishes?"" Translated by Zhang Fenling, Beijing United Publishing Company, January 2022) There is also Chunyu and nostalgia: ""This spring rain must be the messenger sent by his family ..."" Page) We have always enjoyed spring. Have you ever thought about how she came? An undergraduate novel selection ""The way Spring Coming"" (Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, January 2022), a novel written by Wang Nuo Nuo tells me: Spring, we need to bring it back, to go to Beiyi to deviate from the direction of the direction The ground axis pulls right. Many people become ""big fish"" to bear this mission. A reincarnation is 8,000 years old, with a broad heart and broad love, so that the begonia flowers are blooming.

Space,"Tomorrow, I want to like myself again",Space,"Lin Xia Satsuma Hi, seventeen, I haven't seen you for a long time, see the words. I heard that after entering March, the weather in Melbourne was still like parabolic lines, high and low, just like your ups and daily mood. Because of the epidemic, the return period is not over. You said that you are suddenly confused. I don't know how to go to the future. You said envy me and published a book again. You say that you feel that you have failed, and the pressure of peers did not disappear due to the steady transition of adolescence, but chased you together over time. When you say this, I seem to see another me, just stand next to you. What a similar mood. Human sadness and joy are not connected, but the trajectory of everyone's life is mostly similar, and they cannot escape the clutch clutch and ups and downs. I often fantasize the previous second, and go back to some special time in the past to change some major choices. In the next second, I consciously dispelled this idea. Essence Night, the past is no longer meaningful. Therefore, if I really give me a chance to reverse or even ten times, I have no grasp, I can make everything better, and have a better and more complete life. I remember that I had a good friend Stan and I was drinking. The two vowed to get 30 next year. It will stand in thirty. You must make some results. The implication, at the age of thirty, we should have achieved fame. As a result, the 30 -year -old arrived quickly, and we still had a big gap along the ""ourselves"". We all have an insurmountable gap with our parents. The love is turbulent, there is no money, no house, no marriage, and the career that loves is just starting, and we have not yet showed the mountains. ""I am thirty years old and just grew up."" At the age of thirty, I started to have a deposit, and I barely had the courage to say ""no"" to everything that hate. Thirty years old, I can really love someone regardless of everything. At the age of thirty, I started to consider buying a house that belonged to myself. Virginia Woolf once said that women must have money and have their own house at the same time. At the age of thirty, I started to force myself, and I couldn't force myself to stay in the strange circle of comparison in my life. Instead, I couldn't peace, but inspected life with a more comfortable attitude and lighter attitude. At the age of thirty, I recognized that I was still an ordinary person with ideals and blood. Life is an uncertain journey, because uncertain, we will be afraid, and because of uncertainty, we are full of expectations. We will definitely encounter. Those who climb on the top of the mountain early will also hit the scenery, and we will definitely hit the mountain. I just start climbing the mountain. There are many people who are on the road like us in reality. Life is alive, there are many thoughts of Pentium, and it is rare for people who are practical. Therefore, whenever you look forward to germination, as long as you have the possibility of approaching, even if there is only a little bit, you should not give up. You are still at the best age. There are infinite possibilities in front of you. Perhaps it is a new journey. The new city may be colorful and different. I wrote down the interval of this letter. The sunshine in March passed through the clouds, passed through white magnolia, passed the glass, and took a beautiful beam on my floor. Everything recovered in the gentle spring light. The lake surface rippled ripples, the emerald was covered with the lawn, the peach was full of branches, the kite soared freely, and Husky dragged the owner in the park to enjoy the footsteps. Such a spring day, should read books, should clear the old things, and sow new hope. ""I like you to be silent, as if you have disappeared. You listen to me from a distance, but my voice can't touch you."" ""When I said 'Future', I just thought about it and became the past. When I said 'Silence', I broke it. """" As long as I think of what I regret in my life, the plum blossoms are full of Nanshan. ""... Reading makes people feel soft, even if it is fleeting, we are willing In the gentleness of that moment -stray. In March, the red willow green is full of spring. In March, rivers are running around and all things are symbiosis. It is better to, from now on, we treat ourselves as a tree in spring, grow new branches, and stretch the body and mind naturally. If we open a book casually, we are bathing in the gentleness of spring and text. Although the mountains and the sea are far away, reading can be flat.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-03/11.htm,2022-04-03,11th edition: Sunday Nights Cup/Nights Light Cup
Space,Very friendly neighbors,Space,"Wu Yue dusk, the ringtone sounded, and I glanced at the screen of the mobile phone, which was called by the neighbor ""Mr. Yu"". A sense of instinctual tension spreads from the heart. Mr. Yu is a good -tempered man. There is a beautiful wife and two smart and lively boys. On the day of the new home, I led my daughter to introduce myself. They politely asked us to chat in the living room. When we resigned, we added WeChat, and his net name was ""fish"". Since then, sometimes I met my children at the door of the elevator when I was sent to school in the morning, and sometimes I met under the sidewalk tree when I picked up the child from school. In fact, I rented the two -bedrooms in this urban area, and only lived on Monday to Friday. On Friday night, we returned to the home of the suburbs and drove to the past on Sunday evening. This cycle has been returning for a few months. WeChat chat dialog box is almost blank. A few days ago, primary and secondary school students in Shanghai began to study at home. There were relatively large TVs in the suburbs, which were more suitable for online classes. Before leaving, I simply packed the textbook and thought it would come back in a few days. Now, the sudden call of Mr. Yu, a neighbor, seems to indicate some accidents. ""Your home is leaking. It may be that the water pipe bursts. Come back and take a look. The water flows out of the room and flows to the public corridor."" Mr. Yu said anxiously. He asked me if I had the key, and the property could come in to help me close the faucet. Coincidentally, the spare keys of the door lock are in my parents 'house, and their parents' houses are nearby, but their communities are being managed in a closed -loop at this time, and they can't get out. ""We rush over now."" I was ready to move immediately. Mr. Yu paused at the end of the phone, ""Then you have to be prepared. Our building also announced a closed loop an hour ago. The water over there is flowing out, and it is impossible to prepare things that the whole family moves back in a few minutes. When I discussed with my husband, I decided to take a look. It was dinner time, and we couldn't care about it. We handed the children to the familiar neighbors and took a care, and they opened the accelerator to the city. Sure enough, the urban house was pulled downstairs, and the two ""big white"" guarded. On the way, I have contacted the property in the community. They have turned off the sluice outside my house, and the flowing water has been suspended. But what is the situation in the family, you can't know if you don't go in. I took a deep breath and made a video call to Mr. Yu downstairs. ""Now we can't get up, I can only ask you to enter the password to enter the door."" I know that this has added a lot of trouble to others, but Mr. Yu agreed that the two boys and his wife also appeared. Everyone was a little excited. Essence We are like a live broadcast of 20 meters across the vertical distance. We must push away the door of the mysterious shipwreck and look at the ""underwater"" world. ""Okay, now I opened the door,"" Mr. Yu said, while slowly pushing away our door, my mind turned out to the table and chairs that drifted out of the water and took my breath. ""Fortunately, there is no water in the living room, there is only the kitchen. You see, there is a deep knuckle."" Mr. Yu stepped in and found the culprit in the sound -then the dishwasher's leader into the water pipe. The faucet should be aging. At a certain time this afternoon, it bounced directly, and the fountain was generally freely waved. Until now, it is still surrounded by water after the sluice is closed. The crisis is temporarily lifted. As for the drainage and cleaning of the water, we can only wait until we will deal with it. This is a blessing in unfortunate, much smaller than the loss I expected. Mr. Yu didn't hang up. After he looked at it, he said, ""Let's help you clean it up, don't worry."" He and his wife spent an hour, using various tools to clean up all the areas of water. No matter how much thanks I say, it is not enough to express this movement, guilt and warmth. One week later, I was unblocked. I returned home and stood on the clean and dry floor tiles, feeling touched. I knocked on the neighbor's door again, ""I'm sorry, I haven't asked the surname?"" The old saying, ""Far relatives are not as good as neighbors"", this is really the case. In this very important period, the friendship of friends is also unusual. This time, we will help us take care of our children, help us call the police and clean, and help us pick up the courier, all of which are neighbors. Neighbor. Give people roses, and have a fragrance of hands. In the hardships of the hardships of the Communist Party, in this world -class city, the unseumed friendship and mutual assistance made the sky blue.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-03/12.htm,2022-04-03,12th Edition: Sunday Nights Cup/Nights Cup
Space ,Those moving melody soothe the home house ,Space ,"◆ Zhu Guang's EU Youth Symphony Orchestra had previously invited the choir to sing a song ""Ode to Ode to Ode to Ode to the Ode to the Ode to Between Germany. The screen broadcast on the Internet is not so clear, but the camera shakes to the square outside the concert hall. The large screen live broadcast on the scene, or the audience standing or sitting, including the elderly sitting in a wheelchair. Almost everyone sang with tears and sang this song. The ""Word Author"" of ""Ode to Joy"" is the German poet Sille. This German ""God's Work"" praised the ""Happy Goddess"" to express that even if ""the custom makes people running, the goddess of joy can eliminate all differences"" ""Hundreds of millions of people unite, everyone loves each other and love each other"" ... Seeing on the screen The picture of the affectionate chorus of men, women, and children is quite touching. We know that the suffering of any material form is not necessarily suffering a hundred years ago; the happiness of any kind of spiritual form of people a hundred years ago can still give people happiness. Which spiritual happiness is the most healing? There is no doubt that music is the first choice. Regardless of the old and young, there are no dysfunction, and now it is available at hand. When you search online, you can bathe in the ""sound cover"" created by human beings for thousands of years -estimated The reason why the headset is always selling -no matter when and where you are, ""the world belongs to me."" If you want to isolate, I will be isolated by music. If you want to go to the desert island, I also have to bring headphones. What music does the epidemic house listen to? The preferred ""John Williams: Berlin Concert"", which is exciting such as Berlin Philharmonic, and the opening song ""Olympic Horn and theme"" just released on February 4th, with a loud noise and a calm rhythm Call the world to condense. It is a competitive event that originated from ancient Greece and the place named in Olympia because of the place where the host is held in Olympia. Its continuation time is far -reaching, and it is rare in human history -such a picture of everyone holding hands and heart connecting must still be loaded into the history. It is recommended that all kinds of Olympic theme music and theme songs are particularly clearing the mind and broadening their hearts. After listening to it, the gods are refreshing and ""curative effect"". In this category, the ""Star Wars"" series, especially theme song, is still composed by John Williams. The ups and downs of the opening melody and excitingness indicate the future of hope. Hayao Miyazaki animated film Royal Concern has the same effect. At the same time, the details are more clear and the emotion is warmer. Secondly, movie music is also a good choice -at the age of 90, John Williams, a musician who often creates a song for movies. Those movie music or musical and movie versions that originally highlighted the theme of the character, with the plot brand, and set out a beautiful atmosphere are always to listen to the music while watching the camera screen to travel. For example, ""City of Philharmonic"" not only has beautiful love, but also Los Angeles Pickup. The ""Infernal Affairs"" series of movies is slightly brain -burning, but listening to the episode ""Forgotten Time"" sung by Cai Qin will help you think about nothing. The movie ""Love Myth"" and the TV series ""The World of Two People"" can make people pass through the beautiful scenery of Shanghai. The melody of the Shanghai gossip episode ""The Poor of the Old Society"" in ""Love Myth"" is brisk and happy. Think about it that you must not be poor, so you will release a lot ... still solemnly recommend ""Me and My Hometown"" movie. ""Father's Three North"" created by promoting songs and Zheng Jun: ""When you disregarded everything, you are now accompanied by you; you are not forgetful to be obsessed with it, and now you have disappeared ..."" But strong, there is a rap of the talker tone and the northern Shaanxi folk songs. The overall rhythm is roughly the same as the heartbeat, but occasionally premature fighting. When encountering the two poles, it must be a good product. This song is included in his latest album ""Two Masks"". Furthermore, it is also a classic, and there are many handed down works that sound tears and sense of intersection in the Chinese symphony, such as ""Red Flag Song"" -This is a case: listening or wearing headphones on the spot or wearing headphones Even if it comes from a distance, it can make people respect our red flags and will appear a variety of moving pictures in front of us. Based on this song alone, it is not considered ""Placing My Love Turkish Pipa"", and must pay tribute to the great, cute, humble and self -disciplined Mr. Lu Qiming. ""Little River Flowing Water"", which is based on the small tone of the people of Yunnan, helps people who love each other to look at each other -this describes that Amei always can't see the sadness of Age's love songs, let us completely want to cherish it. People in front of you. Listen to Wu Bixia's version, know the most dignified interpretation; you can also listen to Gong Linna's singing, with a stronger pop band assembly; you can also listen to Xiao Jingteng's somewhat rough version ... the most common also include various national orchestras The concerto -a little bit happier than ""Little River Flowing Water"" is ""Yi Dance"", which is a little bit happier than ""Yi Dance"" is ""Yao Dance"", but it is a moving work that is straightforward. What must be cheerful is the ""Beijing Good News to Bianzhai"" of various band versions, which makes people want to dance. There is no doubt that one of the most cheese types in Chinese folk music is Guangdong Silk Bamboo, such as ""Hi Yangyang"" -ton this song is often a song on the stage during the Spring Festival, just as the Vienna New Year concert always uses ""Radesky to perform songs in the song"" Radersky 》 The end is the same. The consistency of the ""step high"" is also a common song of the awards ceremony, which is suitable for walking on the treadmill. Of course, Guangdong Silk Bamboo passed from the Jiangnan area. Jiangnan Silk Bamboo is a national non -heritage -derived from Taoism music, which can be regarded as a health song. Adding a song ""Suzhou Night Song"", the first version of Oda and Zhengzheng -yes, the one who sang the theme song of ""Tokyo Love Story"".

Space,The name of the name of the name is different,Space,"Text/Fu Xiuhong's nickname, also known as milk name, milk name, and small characters. It is the first time that Chen Guang was born by his parents. It is also the first time that Ara's life has accepted the name. Take the vulgarity of small names since ancient times. ""Book of Rites · Tan Gong"" sparse: ""Beginning in March and adding the name."" ""White Tiger Tongde theory · Name"": ""The name of the name is also known as the young and humble."" Because according to the ancient ritual ""young name and crown word"", you have to take another name when you grow up. Historical waves do not have few celebrities. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period, Chen Guang, Jin Chenggong and Lu Chenggong's small names were called ""black buttocks""; the Three Kingdoms Chen Guang, Cao Cao's name ""Azuo"", Liu Chan's nickname ""A Dou""; the small name of Tao Yuanming in the Eastern Jin Dynasty is ""Platinum"", Xie Lingyun, a poet in the Southern Dynasties, ""Guer Er"", Wang Anshi, the northern Song Dynasty, ""Hunglang"". When you grow up, do n’t take the nickname into the “bottom of the box”, or even do n’t want to spicy others. In fact, the nickname depends on anyone to call. If it is loved ones and close friends, the nickname is familiar, there is always a different kind of intimacy. There is Chen Guang, and a little name is better than the name. Speaking of a nickname, I think of a joke. I went to the fourth grade of Chen Guang in the fourth grade of elementary school. I once called a classmate in the same village ""blackhead"". I didn't expect to dial a new female teacher in a school. In the class, Chen Guang, the teacher criticized me severely, saying that I don't understand politeness. Yi said, shouting dogs can be called ""blackheads"" and ""white hair"". As a result, other students laughed when they listened. Some people told the teacher that the classmate Xiao Ming was called ""Blackhead"". Allah has a custom in the local area to help the villain a nickname. girl. In fact, the grandmother shouted Xiaohong and Xiaolu in her mouth, thinking that she was healthy and strong in her heart. One writer was written in a memoir of the hot memoir, and Yi Xiaochenguang was forced to leave his hometown. Later, when Yim's mother heard the news of Yi, he begged all the way to find Yi, and called Yi Xiao's name, ""As long as there is a bowl of a bowl Porridge, my mother will drink with you. ""Yes, no matter how hard the sun is, the Mom also leaves a large bowl of porridge to dialect the small porridge. Every time I recall the scene, Yi is sad. Jia Pingwa Xiaochenguang, Mom hoped that Yi would be peaceful in her life, called Yi ""Pingwa"". After growing up, Jia Pingwa felt ""Pingwa"" kindly and delicious, took his homophonic, changed the ""baby"" to ""concave"", and became a name. Of course, Xiao Ming is not merit everywhere, and Chen Guang will also have misunderstandings. Writer Huang Zongying, a younger brother, is one year younger than Yi. The younger brother entered the kindergarten Chen Guang, and the teacher asked: ""What kind of white appearance in the spicy house?"" The brother said, ""Play with the little girl (Zong Ying Xiaoming Little Girl)."" The teacher asked again, ""What is the younger sister?"" My brother replied, ""It's my sister."" I didn't expect it, because I had a few gossip, the teacher actually suspected that the younger brother had a problem. The nickname is childlike and interesting.

Space,Together in the future,Space,"Due to the injustice of fate in Class 3 (20), the first seven -one middle school (20) of the first seventh middle school, some lives live in pain and cold, but we live in the same earth village with them, and we should give them more care. , Together with them to the future. In the winter day before the New Year, I went to the welfare home with the school piano community to perform public welfare performances. The welfare home is not large, and there is a piano in the center of the cabin. The house is full of cold as outside. The teacher there tells us that they are niche -congenital disability, abandoned, or suffering from psychological diseases, and they always close themselves ... They have lost too much beauty. The future in their hearts may be dark. My heart was touched at once, and my eyes were moist. Looking at the children next to the piano, I gathered the courage to walk to them. Maybe, what can I do, and go out of the darkness with them? ""My sister plays a"" Dao Xiang ""for you?"" With the help of the teacher, the noisy children were scattered, and I sat on the stool and started playing. The song ""Fragrance"" is brisk and always makes me feel happy. At this time, the beautiful piano sounded in the hut. I hope it can break the ""thick barriers"" in the children's hearts and quietly enter the children's hearts. I was surprised to find that a little boy swayed with the rhythm, with a smile on his face. I also moved with him and followed the music ... ""You teach me to play the piano."" After I finished playing, the boy who listened to the music told me timidly. Although he was not very sharp, although he was slightly stiff, he no longer avoided my eyes and no longer with fear and doubt. ""Okay, let's."" I accompanied him to the piano again and helped him sit on the stool. ""This is Central C ..."" I told him about the position of each sound and the method of hard work. He also worked hard to move the less flexible little hand, trying to press the key, and wrote curiosity and seriousness with his face. Essence I said a tone, he played a sound, and I pointed out errors and defects for him. His little fingertips were pale, and his face was slightly reddish, and gradually, he could play three sounds, four sounds, and even more ... He was sitting on the piano stool, and his calf was not enough to the ground. I seemed to see myself ten years ago: curiosity about the piano, looking forward to the future. His ""thick barrier wall"" may be melted by music. Seeing that he was no longer closed, I also felt my own value: let them who lost their families, felt the warmth of the family in the social family. Just like the lyrics in ""Dao Xiang"": ""Remember that you said that home is the only castle, as the rice incense rivers continue to run ..."" Before leaving, the little boy stopped me. He said he liked the song very much and wanted me to play him. I squatted down and hugged him. If you work hard, in the future, you can play your own piano and listen to yourself. You can hear more and more beautiful melody; in the future, you will be able to learn a lot of tunes and truly feel the charm of music. Let's go together to go towards a bright future ... This year's Winter Olympics theme song ""Together to the Future"" sang: ""We all need love, everyone holds up the hand ... we all have love, come to open all the doors ... … ""I think in the future, society can be equal, without discrimination and indifference. These children can be respected by others and get more care. Take the hands of those children, let's go towards that loving society together, and to the future together!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-03/15.htm,2022-04-03,15th edition: Sunday Nights Cup/Happy Composition
Space,The scarf that never faded,Space,"After the wedding, Deng Xiaoping bought a wool scarf for his wife's ""elephant"" trademark. ""Good -looking! It's so beautiful!"" Deng Xiaoping said, watching his wife with a new scarf. ""If you go out in the future, try to tie it as much as possible, so it is not easy to be recognized by your enemy's true identity."" ""Knowing that you bought it for me ..."" After the marriage, the Deng Xiaoping and the Zhou Enlai couple rented to live in In a small building. However, under the underground work under white horror, although the couple worked with the Central Secretariat, they could not always be together, let alone watching a movie and visiting the street. For the sake of safety and insurance, I did not take a group photo in Shanghai. In May 1929, Jiang Gui war ended. At that time, Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui, chairman of the Kuomintang Guangxi Provincial Government and the special military association and director of the Appeasement Office, were willing to cooperate with our party. Therefore, the Party Central Committee decided to send Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Guangxi to carry out revolutionary work. ""Go, don't think about it. I have Sister Little Sister!"" Zhang Xizheng was pregnant, holding his stomach, but comforted his husband. This walk is three months. When Deng Xiaoping returned to Shanghai from Guangxi to report to the Central Committee to report the work plan of the ""Encyclopedia"", Zhang Xizheng, the wife who was about to be present, was sent to Shanghai Baolong Hospital to wait for production ... When Deng Xiaoping rushed to the hospital after the report was over, the doctor would He stopped outside the delivery room: ""You can't go in now! She is hard to give birth ..."" I don't know how long, and a ""wow"" baby crying in the delivery room suddenly ... ""Give birth, it is a female sister ..."" The doctor explain. But I also told Deng Xiaoping: As Zhang Xizheng's childbirth time was too long, the pathogen was infected, and she suffered from puerbid fever. In the next day, the weak Zhang Xizheng woke up and fell asleep, while Deng Xiaoping accompanied her day and night ... In the end, Zhang Xizheng failed to survive, with unlimited nostalgia and regrets. inside. It is not just that their only daughter died a few days later. Zheng Naiwu River sobbed, and the sky was crying. Under white horror, Zhang Xizheng's body was buried for several times. It was not until the spring of the following year that Li Qiang of the Central Specialkee was buried in the Jiangwan Cemetery with Deng Yingchao and Zhang Xizhen's sister Zhang Xizhen. At that time, I didn't dare to use the real name. The tombstone only wrote ""Zhang Zhou's"", and the monument also used a pseudonym. The two important leaders of the CCP who were buried next to Zhang Xizheng: Luo Yinong and Su Zhaosheng. After the liberation of Shanghai, Deng Xiaoping's first ""private affairs"" was to find the bones of the dead wife. The original cemetery was completely disrupted by the Japanese invading army due to the construction of the airport. After many times, Zhang Xizheng's bones were finally found and placed in the Ruijin Garden of Deng Xiaoping in Shanghai. Later, the Shanghai Martyrs Cemetery was established, and Zhang Xizheng's bones were officially buried in the martyr's cemetery. At this time, people saw the five words ""Zhang Xizheng"" and the black and white photos inlaid on the tombstone. This photo was taken by Zhang Xizheng when she was in Moscow, and was the only precious photo she stayed in the world. The wool scarf, which stays at the Longhua Martyrs Memorial Hall today, was donated by Zhang Xizheng's relatives. According to Zhang Jia, this wool scarf is Zhang Xizheng's relics, and it is also the only precious token between her and Deng Xiaoping. The ruthlessness is life and death, and the true love is love.
