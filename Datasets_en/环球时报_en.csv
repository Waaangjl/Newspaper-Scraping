However, in the United States with a serious epidemic, huge pressure caused many nurses to leave, resulting in a shortage of manpower, and nurse income rose sharply. The average annual income of ordinary nurses before the epidemic is about $ 60,000. The salary of travel nurse is higher than that of ordinary nurses. After the outbreak, the annual income of some travel nurses reaches $ 200,000, exceeding the salary level of many doctors. Travel nurses do not refer to nurses who are nursing during travel. This title emphasizes the liquidity and temporary nature of such people engaged in the work of nurses. Where there is a vacancy of nurse positions, travel nurse will go up. For those who like to travel, travel nurse is an ideal job. It can be traveled in the place where they work and are around, and they are not just ""passing by"" as ordinary tourists. Time tour and deeply experience the local customs and customs.  Most of the senior nurses  Travel nurses generally work for 8 to 13 weeks, and the temporary work of 3 months is the most common. The income of travel nurses has soared after the epidemic, and the salary provided by many travel nurse positions exceeds $ 5,000 per week. Travel nurse must have a professional qualification certificate for nurse. The premise of obtaining this certificate is to graduate from a specialized nursing college and have a certain work experience before taking a specific exam. After passing the exam, you can get the certificate. The position of general travel nurse also requires a one -year work experience in relevant hospital departments. Therefore, most travel nurses are senior nurses who have experienced full -time nurses in several years, and then job -hopped to engage in travel nurses with a higher degree of freedom.  Buy a car to work  In the United States, there are not a few people who like to work in travel nurses. According to local media reports, a travel nurse who likes travel simply bought a RV while working all over the country. have to. Another major advantage is that the employment time is more flexible. For travel nurses, if you want to make more money, you can receive more tasks. When you do n’t do money, you can enjoy the holiday without applying for work or receiving tasks. Travel nurses can also agreed with employers in the contract to agree with specific vacations, such as not going to work on weekends, vacation on Christmas, and so on. In addition, travel nurses can stay away from workplace troubles such as ""office politics"" and complex interpersonal relationships because of their passengers.  The profession of travel nurse also gave practitioners a chance to ""taste first and then buy"". When travel nurse wants to find a city to settle, you can conduct a comprehensive experience of a certain city and a hospital from the aspects of life, work content, and colleagues during work. Nurse.  The first person in the United States to vaccinate the COVID-19 vaccine  The nurse's occupation did not originate in the United States. According to records, the earliest hospitals in the world were a church hospital established in 1836 in Germany. In the 1860s, the importance of nursing work during the Northern and Southern War was reflected, and nurses were gradually recognized as an emerging profession. At that time, the most famous nurse in the Northern Army was Ms. Clark Barton, and she later became the founder of the American Red Cross. The nurse in the Southern Army, Sally Thomp, is not easy. She not only has good care of her care, but also has outstanding organizational ability.  In the United States, another nurse was loaded into the history book and was selected as ""100 characters affecting the United States"". Her name was Margaret Sange. Because of seeing many women's pain and misfortune caused by excessive fertility and abortion, the nurse advocated family planning and contraception, and after decades of hard work to promote the freedom of contraception into the US constitution. After two World War I, the nurse was called ""angels during the war."" On August 15, 1945, a photo of a sailor in the New York Plaza kissed a nurse's ""victory"" photo became a sign of the victory of the world's anti -fascist war. The United States later cast this classic scene into bronze statues and placed it permanently in the museum. American nurses also have their own magazine ""Today's American Nurse"". Many movies, TV dramas and literary works often praise nurses. The name of a documentary is ""American Nurse: Healing the United States"".  After the covid-19 epidemic outbreak, many nurses were unwilling to vaccine because they were worried about side effects. Many nurses resigned because the hospital stipulated that nurses must be vaccinated. However, the first person in the United States to vaccinate the COVID-19 vaccine was Nurser Sandra Lindsi from New York City. Some American politicians tweeted her ""real hero"". In the summer of 2021, when a parade was held in Manhattan, New York, the United States, Sandra Lindsay took the convertible to the top of the team.",nurse; epidemic; New York; the United States;

""Infection of Omikon's death cases, but from the current point of view, the mortality rate is about one -thousandth or even one -thousandth. The overall is relatively low, but we cannot take it lightly for the protection of these key groups. ""Hu Bijie said.  Chen Erzhen said that considering the characteristics of the crowd, if it is an elderly patient and a crowd of organs' own organs, after being hit by COVID-19, the response ability decreases, and it may become a high-risk patient. ""We also have related plans for high -risk patients. Thinking the problem is more complicated and serious, so that there is no need to use it, even if we are prepared. Use this principle to arrange our resources.""  In an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 4th, the doctor Zhuang Shili, who has a long-term attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, believes that the current virus contagious has increased several times, but the fatality is reduced, or the vaccination of COVID-19 vaccine has reduced the help The fatality of the virus. It can be seen that Shanghai and Wuhan are facing ""different opponents.""  New drugs have been used for diagnosis patient treatment  In the ""New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)"" released in mid -March, antiviral therapy was further regulated. Among them, the two specific anti-COVID-19 virus drugs approved by the State Drug Administration are written into the diagnosis and treatment plan, that is, COVID-19 oral drugs and domestic monoclonal antibodies developed by Pfizer Romi Siwei Single Removal Anti -injection).

After the 5-day course of treatment, the patient's virus load decreased significantly, and the discharge time could be shortened to 5-7 days. In addition, the drug can also provide prevention and protection for medical staff of high -risk positions.  Because the epidemic in Shanghai and Jilin is currently tense, COVID-19 oral drugs naturally give priority to these two places. According to previous public reports, on March 20, 1,000 boxes of COVID-19 therapeutic Pharmaceuticals were used as the Shanghai Municipal Government COVID-19 therapy drug guarantee, and arrived in Shanghai to fight against COVID-19 medical supplies guarantee base. It is sent to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center for clinical treatment.  Hu Biejie, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Infection Management, Affiliated to Fudan University, said in an interview with the media that there are currently tens of thousands of cases in Shanghai in Shanghai, most of which are asymptomatic infected or mild infections. This part is basically not necessary to take medicine. A small number of infected people may have a combined bacterial infection. At this time, antibacterial drugs can be used appropriately, but if there are infected people with high risk factors, they must focus on this group of people. Among them It shows that if this medicine is used within 5 days of the onset, this medicine can effectively inhibit severe illnesses.","Shanghai; ""Global Times""; medical team; infected person; asymptomatic; square cabin hospital; Lu Hongzhou; epidemic prevention and control; Lito Navavi; medical staff;"

After the fifth wave of Hong Kong, the immigration quota is tightened. It is difficult to return to Hong Kong to update the entry endorsement. Public opinion is concerned whether this will cause the mainland talents who have the willingness to go to Hong Kong to give up, leading to the loss of talents.  Member of the Legislative Council co -signed, calling on the ""Special Affairs Office""  Several members of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong co -deployed on the 6th, hoping to ""special offices"" and set up green lights for mainland talents to stay in Hong Kong.  According to the Hong Kong ""Sing Tao Daily"" reported on the 6th, Hong Wen, a member of the Legislative Council, who is also the Secretary -General of the Hong Kong Huajing Association, recently initiated a joint department with five other Legislative Council members to believe in Li Jiachao, the director of the Secretary for Political Affairs (announced on the 6th that he resigned on the 6th ), Zeng Guowei, Director of the Political Affairs and Mainland Affairs Bureau, and Deng Bingqiang, director of the Security Bureau, hoped that the Hong Kong Government would authorize the mainland office to handle the endorsement in the short term, so that the talents, talents, and students who conform to the entry plan can update their endorsements in the Mainland. According to the regulations of the Hong Kong Entry Department, people who meet the various entry plans must go to Hong Kong to ""activate"" in person within the specified time when they update their entry endorsements.  In the letter, Hong Wen and others said that under the epidemic, a group of excellent talents, talents, and students stayed in the Mainland. They had to update their endorsements in Hong Kong within the specified time. In addition, entering the mainland from Hong Kong for 21 days, it also causes them to be inconvenient in academic and work. Many people have given up the idea of giving up the endorsement of the excellent special entry. However, after the epidemic, restarting a large number of talents in Hong Kong is inseparable from talents. These people are selected by the SAR government and eager to go to Hong Kong for development. Essence  According to a report from Hong Kong's ""Base"" on the 6th, Yang Tiantian, who plans to go to Hong Kong and work in Chinese financial institutions through the talents, has been temporarily working in the company's Shenzhen office because the epidemic has stayed in Shenzhen for some time. Although her work was not affected, she was only 3 months left before she returned to Hong Kong to activate endorsement. She said that accepting isolation is expected, but Shenzhen and other cities have very few entries in Hong Kong's entry quotas and daily appointments. In addition There are great uncertainty. Yang Tiantian said that she cherishes Hong Kong's work and studies like many talents and students in the Mainland. She does not want to abandon her endorsement because she fails to return to Hong Kong within the time limit.  Hong Wen roughly estimated that about 3,000-5000 people could not go to Hong Kong to update their endorsements in person. In an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 6th, she said that in the past few years, many talents have been lost in Hong Kong in the past few years. Objective needs for going back and forth. The isolation of more than two years has brought great trouble to their lives and work. It is very important to keep these talents in the Mainland and let them fill the talents of these industries. To this end, Hong Wen hoped that the SAR government would ""special offices."" In addition to facilitating the endorsement of the endorsement, she also mentioned that it can use the Talent Talent Database of the Entry Department for some investigations. Please contact the Hong Kong Government's office in the Mainland office to connect the batch of Youzhuan back to the Mainland. Hong Kong's sense of belonging.  It is understood that the five offices of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in the Mainland can handle some entry and exit matters such as the special zone passport and the return certificate of Hong Kong, and have the basis for accepting the activation of endorsement affairs. Since October 2020, the mainland entry and exit management department has already handled the return certificate for Hong Kong and Macao residents who have been in the Mainland and the expires of the return of the countryside. Earlier, applicants who replaced the home return permit must return to Hong Kong and Macao. Apply.  How many people have attracted the ""Excellent Talent"" plan  In 2015, after the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government suspended 10 million investment immigrants, he shouted the slogan ""Hong Kong is missing without wealth"", and increased its efforts to attract overseas and mainland talents to come to Hong Kong to work and start a business.  As early as July 2003, Hong Kong launched the ""Entering the Mainland Talent Program"", also known as the ""Expert Plan"", aiming to attract outstanding talents and professional talents in the Mainland to work in Hong Kong. Data show that in 2019, the Hong Kong Immigration Department approved a total of 14053 applications, of which art/culture, financial services, academic research and education, business and trade, engineering and construction, information technology, legal services, etc. are all popular industries.  Another major project in Hong Kong's introduction of Mainland talents is the ""Talent Plan"", that is, the ""Excellent Talent Immigration Plan"", the purpose is to attract outstanding talents around the world to settle in Hong Kong. The project was launched in June 2006. The annual quota of 2020 increased from 1,000 to 2,000, and about 86%of the approved overseas talents came from the Mainland. By the end of 2021, a total of 36689 applications were received, of which 9131 applicants received allocated places. The first three sources were the Mainland, the United States and Canada. Service, information technology and telecommunications and construction, measurement, engineering and construction.  Hong Wen told the Global Times reporter that Hong Kong's financial industry has a large number of ""Hong Kong drifts"", but in fact, mainland talents involve multiple industries. She said that the Hong Kong Government introduced the talents of talents, in fact, has measured the degree of compatibility of such talents and the demand for local market; those who can obtain a talent signing of the talents usually have employed contracts with enterprises, or from Hong Kong needs to need from Hong Kong. field of. Hong Wen said that Hong Kong is relatively lacking in medical care, care, science and technology, education and other fields.  Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue said on March 30 this year that the number of people to go to Hong Kong through the ""Talent Program"" has been rising, and the number of non -local students in Hong Kong's 8 -funded universities has increased. Lin Zhengyue's conservative estimation in the ""Political Report"" is that nearly 5,000 non -local graduates will benefit from each year. They apply for employment in Hong Kong and live for 7 years to become permanent residents. In addition, the annual quota of the ""Talent Plan"" will also increase to 4,000.  Hong Wen believes that the overall business environment of Hong Kong and some potential development categories, such as financial and high -end service industries, are still attractive for mainland talents. However, this attractiveness is not comprehensive -in certain industries, Hong Kong must vigorously create development opportunities in order to be attractive to talents. ""For example, the development of Chuangke industry, talents and industries are a problem of chickens and eggs. Without industries, they cannot attract talents, and they cannot develop without the talent industry."" She said that this requires a set of development plans in Hong Kong. The angle of the industry and talents go hand in hand.  Hong Kong universities are still attractive to the mainland  ""Repair storm"" plus the epidemic pinch, Hong Kong universities have faced various pressures in the past two years. It is also the focus of many universities to consider whether it can be attracted to mainland students.  In May last year, the Hong Kong Education Bureau disclosed the number of students who funded the course of the 2018/19 school year to 2020/21. The results showed that the proportion of 6 of the ""Eight University"", including urban universities, Lingnan University, Chinese University, University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, and the University of Hong Kong. Among them, Hong Kong University's proportion is the highest, with 3423 people, accounting for 16.7%; followed by China University, 3044, accounting for 14.8%. The ""Hong Kong School of Study in China"" shows that the number of mainland students going in Hong Kong from January to July 2021 increased by 126%year-on-year. The annual report data of the Hong Kong Entry Department also shows that the number of mainland students who have been approved by students from 2020-2021 is 32,332, an increase of 59%over 20361 in 2017-2018.  However, with the increasingly severe situation in the Hong Kong epidemic, many mainland students choose to go home online. The Hong Kong Headline Daily reported earlier that the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University have announced that they have taught in the form of online classes since February. There are videos of Hong Kong University in the Mainland. Zhu Zhu, who was studying at the School of Journalism and Communication of the Chinese University, was in Jiangsu. He planned to fly directly from Hong Kong because he could not grab the quota of Shenzhen Bay. She said, ""If the diagnosis is only one or two hundred, I may not go back, but now I can't stop the car, my classmates have gone back a lot.""  Some students are troubled by rent. It is understood that the monthly house rent in Hong Kong students ranges from HK $ 4,000-6000, and some high-end homes are tens of thousands. Students often need to sign a year -on -year contract, and they cannot retire and check out halfway, which means losing a large amount of rent.  However, some comments believe that although Hong Kong universities are affected by social events and epidemic, they still have some attraction to mainland students. In addition to being able to go to the top schools in Europe and the United States, when the European and American epidemic outbreaks, Hong Kong universities have become ""shelters."" Some students said that considering that the world ranking in Hong Kong schools is high, tuition fees are better than Britain and Australia, and they are closer to home, so they are still the first choice for further education.",Hong Kong; Finance; Finance; Professional Talent;

""However, Ms. Lu also said that these days have received vegetable bags and instant noodles from the community, and daily eating problems are being resolved.  According to Chen Tong on the 7th, due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the end of the e -commerce platform's end distribution capacity has also decreased significantly under the context of the epidemic prevention and control, which has also significantly declined, resulting in the outstanding contradiction between the last mile and the last 100 meters. The fight against against the disease affected the quality of life of millions of households, and the phenomenon of difficulty in reaching the house of life was that Shanghai was going to promote the protection work.  Chen Tong said that Shanghai is trying to solve problems such as low equipment efficiency, lack of nodes of living materials, and insufficient labor capacity, and fully combat price illegal acts. At present, Shanghai has allowed non -immune -related causes to be closed in the courier of the courier in the community.

Infection status. Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue said on the 8th that the fast -testing of the whole people is a voluntary action, hoping that 7 million citizens in the city will participate.  According to the ""Sing Tao Daily"" report, the SAR government published advertisements on the front page of multiple newspapers across Hong Kong on the 8th, and sent information to mobile phone users, calling on the citizens of Hong Kong to actively respond to the fast testing activities of the whole people. In the early morning of the 8th, a number of artists in Hong Kong responded to showing their own negative photos. A member of the Legislative Council also invited party friends and citizens to test them to test them.  According to the Hong Kong Internet media ""Hong Kong 01"", Lin Zhengyue quoted the research on the University of Hong Kong on the 8th that as of April 6, the instant prevalence rate of Hong Kong was 0.56%, that is, about 40,000 people infected COVID-19. /4 people are known to be confirmed and they are recovering, that is, there are still 3/4 and about 30,000 people who have been infected but they don't know. The national fast test can find these 30,000 people and have the opportunity to cut off all the communication chain to reach the rough ""Zero-Covid"". She said that it is very simple to do a quick test, only a few minutes, and the waiting result is 20 minutes. On the first day of the fast test, the Hong Kong Department of Health stated that the preliminary reporting figures were increased compared to before.  Hong Kong people have different responses to the fast -testing of the whole people. According to Radio Hong Kong on the 8th, some citizens said that if everyone responded to the government's call for self -testing and registering positive results, it was believed that it would be helpful to control the epidemic. However, some young people do not agree with the effect of voluntary fast antigen test plan. They believe that many Hong Kong people are not worried about the infection of COVID-19, but they are worried about being infected and lost work income. It is estimated that many people may not report to report Positive cases, the government is advised to solve the problem of medical system priority.  The Hong Kong media ""Hong Kong Zai"" issued a social comment on the 8th that the fast test of the whole people is a key step in Hong Kong's ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and it is also conducive to gradually relaxing social distance measures from the 21st of this month. If the citizens do not participate because they are afraid of trouble or other reasons, the effect will be greatly discounted, so that the virus will have the opportunity to take advantage of it. The economic people's livelihood that has just been warm up may be frozen again, and the citizens in Hong Kong will be losers. Therefore, every citizen should be consciously involved. The ""Ming Pao"" comments said that the accuracy of the antigen fast test is not as good as nucleic acid testing.

Although as early as December last year, Tianjin's ""first battle"" Omikon in the Mainland, with the recent outbreaks of local epidemic in Jilin, Shanghai and other places, the complexity of Omikon was highlighted again.  Experts said that the Omikon strains or Delta strains are ten times difficult to prevent and control. This means that protecting people's lives and health must pay more efforts. Earlier, when the grounds of Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Jilin, etc., were spread to Omikon, they strictly adopted prevention and control measures such as isolation, control, seal control, screening, and screening. Practice has repeatedly stated that adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation and shaking, and resolutely achieve ""four response"" is the key to win the battle against the epidemic.  It is worthwhile that when the epidemic prevention and control are tight, some of the specious views come out to ""bring rhythm"". They advocate ""Omikon is a large influenza"", the United States and Britain and other countries have ""successfully coexist with the virus"", trying to create the ""prosperous scene"" that Western countries have completely got rid of the epidemic interference in public opinion, and even think that this is a West in the West The victory of ""group immunity"". But in terms of moral or scientific, these views are completely untenable.  The characteristics of Omikon poisonous strains, fast spread, and decreased toxicity have also widened the arguments such as ""large influenza"". However, from the current foreign data, the mortality rate during the popularity of Omiko strains must be Higher than Delta. The Director -General of the WHO Tan Desai recently said that the mortality rate of some countries has reached the highest level since the beginning of the Great Popularity. The basic national conditions of our country are that the population 60 and over reaches 267 million, the children's population exceeds 250 million, and the two add more than 500 million. ""The mentality must adhere to the"" dynamic Zero-Covid "", take the initiative to attack, strictly control and control in order to fundamentally avoid the scale of the epidemic.  In fact, the United States and Britain and other countries have ""coexisted"" with the virus, but it is just a passive ""lying"" that is ""lying down"" that ""do not want to do but can't do"" on the issue of epidemic prevention and control. Its so -called ""group immunity"" is essentially the dismissal of a large number of low immune capabilities. This is a cruel social Darwinism. And China uses strict management and isolation policies to protect the elderly and people with basic diseases. This is amazing.  Even if a lot of life costs are paid, Western countries are far from saying that they have ""defeated"" the virus. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, it ended all epidemic prevention measures in March and opened the so -called ""coexistence model"". question. Germany is also aware of the seriousness of the problem. It has announced the cancellation of the decision to stop mandatory isolation in May. The country's Minister of Health even publicly stated that he had ""made a mistake"".  Practice has proved that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best choice for China's current resistance. The more tight the epidemic, the more comprehensive and accurate adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". It is worth emphasizing that some places that cause people to live normally are a series of problems brought by the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". We must comprehensively and accurately adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". On the one hand, we must adhere to ""fast response, precise prevention and control"", based on the early grasping, small, and grasping the foundation to achieve the foundation together. To achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, resolutely remove formalism and bureaucraticism, and minimize the impact of epidemic situation on economic and social development.  Over the past two years, it is precisely because it has always adhered to the people's supremacy, life first, and adhering to scientific accuracy, dynamic Zero-Covid, we have to maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health, and my country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a global leading position. In the face of a new round of severe tests, comprehensively and accurately adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", fully show that the party and the government are highly responsible for spiritual and practical attitude.

Regarding whether it will be ""coexist"", the island is constantly controversial.  After the Qingming Festival, the confirmed cases of Taiwan continued to reach a new high this year. 442 cases were added to the island on the 9th, and 1 death was added. The Taiwan ""Epidemic Command Center"" announced that it will extend the 65 -year -old vaccination of 500 yuan for NT $ 500 to the end of May. The Tsai Ing-wen authorities shouted the ""new Taiwan model"" for this purpose that the goal set by the authorities at this stage was ""Seeking Zero-Covid and Effective Management of Mildness"". The epidemic prevention strategy continued to go on the goal of ""disaster reduction"". Chen Shizhong, the ""commander of the Epidemic Prevention Command Center"", is the first time that ""Zero-Covid is impossible"", but he said that ""coexisting with the virus"" is inaccurate, but it should be said that it is ""disaster reduction"" or ""effective control of light control light"" or ""effective control light light"" Symptoms. Li Mingzheng, director of the Department of Infectious Department of the Revitalization Hospital of Taiwan, estimates that the epidemic on the island will reach its peak one month later. The pace should be slowed down so that the number of cases should not be increased with steep slopes to coexist with the virus.  According to Lianhe News Network reported on the 10th, Taiwan's ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"" recently said that when the number of diagnostic people on the island exceeded 1,500 cases, the ""confirmed home care management"" will be launched, but the relevant regulations will still be blurred. New Taipei Mayor Hou Youyi said on the 9th that home care is divided into life and medical care. Combined with the remote platform, the home care of mild and asymptomatic diagnosis is quickly adjusted. At present, the home care management on the island is under the age of 65. Luo Yijun, deputy leader of the medical response team of the Taiwan ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"", said that after the illness of the people over 65, people over 65 developed into a high risk of medium -illness and were not suitable for isolation at home.  However, the ""New Taiwan model"" of the Taiwan authorities has been questioned by many people. Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe and Hou Youyi, the mayor of New Taipei, criticized him to become a slogan. Li Bingying, the convener of the ""Ministry of Health and Welfare"" infectious disease prevention and treatment consulting team, said that the ""new Taiwan model"" is a gray area, which is not complete Zero-Covid, but it cannot completely abandon epidemic prevention. ""For Taiwan, it is estimated that it is estimated There is a long way to go. "" Li Bingying said that the so -called ""coexistence"" means that the border is controlled and the mask does not need to be worn, but the local epidemic must start immediately. He said that if ""coexiste"" directly, the disadvantaged group and the elderly may be very severe, and they will overwhelm the medical system.  The Kuomintang ""legislator"" Wen Yuxia said on the 10th that ""disaster reduction"" and ""severe seeking Zero-Covid"" should reduce the COVID-19 mortality rate, provided that the vaccination rate of high-risk groups must be increased. Virus drugs. However, the Taiwan ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"" has only 2,3500 oral medicines, with an average of one person per thousand people. In case the epidemic is heating up, how can we ""coexist"" with viruses with bare hands? She criticized that not only did the purchase slow, but also the equivalent of testing reagents was more expensive than overseas.  What's even more ironic is that ""the president of the executive"" Su Zhenchang just said that after the ""world first"" in Taiwan's epidemic prevention, it was reported that the epidemic was burned into the ""Presidential Palace"" -the Cai Yingwen dinner with his family during the Qingming Festival. Home isolation. However, although the official residence had just held an epidemic prevention meeting, Lai Qingde, Su Zhenchang, and Chen Shizhong who attended the meeting should have been self -healthy monitoring, but soon lifted the monitoring. ""Lianhe Daily"" commented on the 10th that the ""New Taiwan Model"" was on the road, the first demonstration was the ""dual -epidemic prevention"". Judging from the practice of meeting officials with Tsai Ing -wen, the ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"" is obviously bullying the people. ""Chen Shizhong can drink red wine and sing.

Regarding the saying that ""the fierceness of the future variant virus is lower than Omikon"", Lu Yongxiong made it clear that this is just a reality. It is not a reality. It cannot be said that the next generation of virus must be low.  The news of the school will be announced soon  Recently, the epidemic in Hong Kong showed signs of ease.

The Center for Health Protection said that the positive number picked up quickly, and the asymptomatic infected rose to nearly 70%, proving that citizens had responded to fast testing operations.  Lin Zhengyue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that 7 million people in Hong Kong would actively participate in the fast test, find out the community invisible patients, and cut off the virus transmission chain as soon as possible to reach Zero-Covid, and citizens can restore their past life. On the 10th, Lin Zhengyue also revealed that this week will announce the positive news of a number of prevention and control epidemic, including the re -classes of schools in Hong Kong. She said that the SAR government will not determine whether students can go to school with vaccination or vaccine, because school is very important for students' mental health and growth. If the school needs a vaccine permit, it is not good for students. She said that the number of injections in the 12-19-year-old students exceeded 90 %, but among the children and elementary school students aged 3-11 years old, there were no first stitches.

The fifth wave of epidemic broke out. A total of 8,557 COVID-19 patients died in Hong Kong, and the mortality rate remained at 0.727%, of which 96%of the deaths over 60 years old accounted for 96%of the overall death case. Ou Jiarong said that the expert consultant group is constantly examining the latest scientific data and deemed discussions whether to vaccinate the fourth pins.

The SAR Government should take more effective measures to increase the vaccination rate of Hong Kong, and let Hong Kong out of the epidemic as soon as possible.

Among them, the ""three reductions"" proposed by the expert group, that is, ""reduce severe illnesses, reduce death, and reduce infection"" is the focus of Hong Kong's next resistance, especially the priority protection of the elderly is the top priority. This means that compared to the national test at a high level of epidemic, medical resources should be concentrated, the inoculation, isolation, and treatment should be strengthened, the right medicine should be applied, and the elder is preferred with accurate and powerful measures.

Gu Honghui, deputy secretary -general of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the director of the Office of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention and Control Work Group, also notified the latest city screening of Shanghai on the 11th: as of 8:00 on the 11th, a total of 25.12 million people were sampled and 21.52 million were completed. Among them, the results were 25,996, and the re -inspection of some positive personnel of mixed pipes is currently underway.  On the other hand, the rapid growth of infected people is also related to the characteristics of the number of infected people with no symptoms and high proportion of this round of epidemic. Liang Wannian analyzed on the 10th that the strains of the popular epidemic in Shanghai were mainly Omikon BA.2, which had a very fast transmission and was particularly hidden. The difficulty of preventing and controlling the epidemic. At present, most of the 16 districts in Shanghai are infected, and there are extensive community communication.  Liang Wannian said, ""Do nucleic acids over and over again, and at the same time do antigen to want to clean it (virus), try to expand the range, find out all possible sources of infection, and then manage it to cut off it.""  Announce the list of new ""three districts""  Gu Honghui announced at the press conference of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control Work on the 11th that in accordance with the relevant provisions of the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism, combined with the actuality of Shanghai, in accordance with the seal control zone, control area, and prevention area, the city implemented a differentiated classification of differentiated prevention and control. Among them, the seal -control area refers to the residential community, natural villages or units, and places reported by those with positive infections in the past 7 days to implement ""7 -day closed management+7 Heavenly Home Health Monitoring""; the control zone refers to The report of the residential community, natural villages or units, and places, implement the ""7 Heavenly Home Health Monitoring"", ""people do not get out of the community and are strictly forbidden to gather""; Places implement ""strengthening social management and control, strictly restricting personnel gathering scale.""  According to preliminary screening results and risk research and judgment, the first batch of ""three districts"" list in Shanghai districts, including 7,624 in the seal control area, 2460 management and control areas, and 7565 prevention zones.  For more than 10,000 seal control areas and control areas in Shanghai, how to ensure that the supply of foods, mother and infant products, and medicines that citizens need to urgently need them are still the most concerned on the citizens. Several Shanghai citizens told the Global Times reporter on the 11th that during the epidemic period, group buying became the most important way for buying food, and the ""head"" responsible for the entire group purchase process became the most important role. Ms. Chen, who is in a seal -controlled area in Pudong, told the Global Times reporter that although she has received vegetable bags issued by the government several times, it is still not enough for the four people at home. Due to the ""competition too fierce"" in the APP, group purchase with other residents in the community became the most stable way to buy food. ""But due to the different epidemic conditions, the residents of the neighborhood committee, and the proportion of the elderly, some community group purchase is smooth, but some community delivery is difficult."" Ms. Chen said that she hopes that the government can further solve the problem of end distribution in the case of ensuring epidemic prevention.  According to the ""Global Times"" reporters, various platforms including Alibaba, JD, and Meituan have strengthened the supply, and urgently allocated their hands to join the delivery team. At the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control press conference held on the 10th, Xiao Shuixian, senior vice president of Hungry, said that in the past week, 2,800 rider returned to the post, and strived to solve the ""last mile"", ""last 100 meters"", ""last 100 meters 100 meters"" ""Delivery bottlenecks.  The Shanghai Market Supervision and Administration Bureau stated on the 10th that ""community group purchase"" has played a positive role in helping citizens' living materials and solving the ""last hundred meters"". At the same time, the Shanghai Market Supervision and Administration Bureau also reminded that the community group purchase organizations and related operators shall be marked in accordance with the regulations. Sales of goods shall be marked with the product name, price and price unit of the product.  Shanghai's prevention and control still has to bite the teeth  Based on the situation of the Shanghai epidemic, recently, ""Omikon is a large influenza"" and ""China should learn to let go of the West"" in domestic social media. In this regard, Liang Wannian believes that compared with flu, Omikon's mutant strains have spread faster and have more hidden propagation, which is more likely to cause large -scale spread. More importantly, the pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strains is significantly greater than influenza. From the global perspective, if the virus is popular, the overall mortality rate of Omicong's mutant strains is higher than the flu, especially in the elderly, and the mortality rate is dozens of times higher than ordinary influenza. Essence  Liang Wannian also said that from the perspective of public health, the whole population is the susceptible crowd of Omikon's mutant strains. my country's elderly population is huge, and the population aging rate of some big cities is higher. If ""lying down"", the epidemic is a disaster for such fragile people.  A recent article published by Zhang Wenhong, director of the Infectious Department of Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, also emphasized that Omikon is not a large flu. It will bite people and mainly bite the elderly who have not been vaccinated.  Chen Xi, an associate professor at the School of Public Health of Yale University, told the Global Times reporter on the 11th that the growth curve of Omikon infection will have a steep peak and it is easy to defeat the medical system. In this case, choosing to ""let go"" like the West will lead to a significant increase in mortality and deaths in China, especially the elderly. Chen Xi said that at present, the vaccination rate and enhanced needle vaccination rate of the elderly in China still need to be improved, and it is also necessary to continue to refine and improve the hierarchical treatment arrangement arrangement according to individual risks and the degree of symptoms.

A spokesman for the National Health and Health Commission Mi Feng said on the 12th that the Health and Health Commission has dispatched more than 40,000 medical staff and the capabilities of 2.38 million nucleic acid testing daily from 16 provinces to support Shanghai. Li Zhiqiang, deputy dean of Wuhan University in Shanghai, said that Wuhan received the huge support of Shanghai during the most difficult day to fight against the epidemic. In this aid, he and his teammates will do their best to help Shanghai cross the difficulty.  Singapore's ""Lianhe Zaobao"" reported on the 12th that Shanghai made the first batch of ""three districts"" list -""seal control zone"", ""management control zone"" and ""prevention zone"" -graded control and control took the first step.

As of the 11th, most European countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, etc., they were also listed in this highest travel risk level.  Easter worry  According to Germany's report on the 12th, the Robert Koch Research Institute reported that in the past 24 hours, Germany's new COVID-19 cases have exceeded 160,000. The Berlin Daily stated on the 12th that with the traditional Western second largest holiday Easter (this year is April 17), and many countries have relaxed epidemic prevention measures, the European epidemic may deteriorate again after the festival.  France added 25,492 COVID-19 confirmed cases on April 11, and the patients in the intensive care unit increased compared to last week. French Minister of Health Welang recently said that France ""has passed the peak of the epidemic rebound"", but then the French Public Health Bureau called for cautiousness, saying that ""the peak of the epidemic rebound has passed."" The French government has announced that the second -agent vaccine enhanced vaccine will be opened to the elderly over 60 years old. ""Tribunal"" commented: ""France has experienced the sixth wave of epidemic. After a short calm, the virus has begun to cycle.

Difficult statistics of the number of people in the United States  The U.S. Forbes magazine said on the 11th that the highly contagious Omikon BA.2 mutant strain was driven, and the number of cases reported in the United States rose again. Canadian television stated on the 11th that in view of the relaxation of the epidemic restrictions, the epidemic was reunited in Canada, and patients with severe illnesses continued to increase. The latest survey of the University of Washington shows that the proportion of Americans who always wear masks in public places have dropped to 23%, the lowest level since April 2020. At the same time, COVID-19 virus detection volume has also decreased significantly. Therefore, for the government, it is more difficult to master the real number of daily infection cases. The case of the BA.2 of the Omikon variants has currently accounted for more than 72%of American cases. The University of Washington estimates that the number of people infected in the United States every day ""may be 9 times the report."" Due to the increase in positive cases in students, Georgetown University and John Hopkins University in Washington have restored the requirements for compulsory masks and nucleic acid testing last week.

On the 12th, a ""legislator"" was diagnosed with infection. This was the first case appearing in the ""Legislative Yuan"". So far, multiple diagnosis and a large number of isolation have appeared in the senior management of the Taiwan authorities.  For the first time, ""legislator"" infection  According to the Taiwan United News Network reported on the 12th, during the Qingming holiday, the Kuomintang ""legislator"" Liao Guodong's office reported that two assistants confirmed. On the 3rd, Liao himself said on Facebook that he personally tested negative, but ""the situation of yin to yang is also very common."" After the holidays, the Taiwan ""Legislative Yuan"" strengthened the epidemic prevention measures where Liao Guodong's office was located. The assistant to work with Liao Tong Floor must take the initiative to provide nucleic acid negative certificates in order to enter the hospital district. However, on the morning of the 12th, the news of Liao ""Yin to Yang"" was still reported. Chen Shizhong, commander of the Taiwan ""Epidemic Prevention Center"", confirmed that there was a ""legislator"" diagnosis, but it would not cause a new wave of impact on the epidemic. It is understood that the Taipei City Health Bureau confirmed the two assistants of Liao Guodong and has been separated at 175 people at home, including two ""legislators"". You Xizheng, the ""Legislative Dean"" of Taiwan, has previously stated that in principle, if there are two ""legislators"" infection, the ""Legislative Yuan"" will hold a meeting in a remote manner.  According to Taiwan media previously reported, Cai Yingwen had a luncheon with his family at the official residence during the Qingming Festival. After that, a family was diagnosed with nucleic acid positive diagnosis. Su Zhenchang and others who had a meeting with her and had contact with her should also be isolated, but they were quickly lifted.  The epidemic began to spread in various core organs in the Taiwan authorities. According to Taiwan's ""China Times"" on the 12th, after the ""Supervisory Institute"" had a driver diagnosed, the ""Executive Yuan"" also had three drivers confirmed on the 11th, including ""Deputy Dean of the Executive Yuan"" Shen Rongjin and Deputy Secretary -General He Peishan. In isolation, the two's followers, office colleagues, and other drivers in the hospital, as well as 35 emergency nucleic acid testing such as cleaning and firefighters. On the 12th, the ""Ministry of Education"" confirmed that a staff member of the subordinate ""International Department"" confirmed COVID-19, and the staff of relevant departments were also changed to home office and asked for nucleic acid testing.  In terms of the army, Bai Honghui, the ""Deputy Minister of Defense"" in Taiwan, revealed that the officers and soldiers of the Taiwan army have accumulated 74 people diagnosed from March 29 to April 11. At the epidemic prevention meeting, the mayor of Taoyuan, the mayor of Taoyuan, specially named the recruits in the camp and returned to Taoyuan for Qingming. On the 3rd, he had dinner with family members in the restaurant. The recruits had caused 12 relatives and friends to infection so far.  Self -tested agent expensive to attract complaints  On the 12th, 663 cases were added to the island, including 551 local cases. Chen Shizhong said that with the current epidemic estimation, the number of local cases at the end of April will exceed a thousand. At present, the medical system can withstand about 40,000 severe patients. The spokesman Zhuang Renxiang also said that thousands of examples or tens of thousands of cases were diagnosed at the end of the month. He revealed that the number of home isolations on the island is about 30,000, and the average of about 3,000 people lift the isolation a day, but at the same time, there are also 56,000 people to the hospital. Zhuang Renxiang announced that in order to accelerate home isolation, testing and lifting the isolation rate, the implementation of new prevention and control strategies will be implemented from now on, and the original isolation will be tested in unified nucleic acid, and now it is changed to home self -test.  However, the price of self -testing agents in Taiwan is very expensive, causing complaints on the island. It is understood that there are currently 5 manufacturers in Taiwan who have obtained the ""Food and Drug Administration"" project manufacturing and manufacturer of home test agents, and 17 manufacturers have been allowed to introduce project introduction. Germany's 100 yuan, 100-130 yuan in Singapore, and 140 yuan in South Korea.  Chen Shizhong argued that this was because the market size of the Taiwan reagent was small and it was difficult to reduce the price. On the 12th, the Kuomintang spokesman Liu Caixuan questioned that Chen Shizhong used only one sentence ""Taiwan market"" to take off. He did not review the errors that lacked pre -deployment and strategic planning. ""This mentality is simply an ostrich."" ""China Times"" questioned on the 12th, who is profitable in the middle? Is there a black box? All parts of the world can make nucleic acid detection tests popularize to facilitate the fast detection of confirmed diagnostic, but Taiwan's operations basically do the opposite. ""Is it because the people are too easy to obtain and test too much positive cases?""  Epidemic prevention conference invites green camp officials  In response to Tsai Ing-wen's ""New Taiwan model"" of ""Seeking Zero-Covid and Effective Management"", the DPP ""legislator"" Shen Fuxiong bluntly stated that the ""new Taiwan model"" is a ridiculous farce. He said that severe illnesses will automatically Zero-Covid, because severe patients are either healing or death, so the correct saying should be ""preventing the deterioration of severe illness"", and what should be done is to increase the vaccine coverage and oral medication for the elderly.  Senior media Gao Yuanliu wrote that many people questioned whether Tsai Ing -wen's nuclear acid negatives were true or false, and whether they would conceal the situation of Cai based on political considerations or to protect their own high -end vaccines. In addition, she invited the ""Epidemic Prevention Strategy Conference"" on the 6th. In addition to the DPP authorities and senior officials and medical control experts, the county mayor only invited the two DPP mayor of Kaohsiung and Taoyuan to participate. Nothing or New Taipei City was invited. This is equivalent to the DPP people holding a strategic meeting on the door.

However, after choosing to ""coexist"" with COVID-19, Britain is facing a severe economic situation. According to the British ""Guardian"", the average of 20.5 people per 100,000 COVID-19 patients at the current England region admitted to the hospital for treatment, reaching the highest level since January 2021, and increased for five consecutive weeks. Medical resources continued to be tense.  At the same time as the epidemic data soared, the ""lying down"" against the disease did not usher in the rapid recovery of the expected economic recovery. According to the British economic outlook for the international accounting institution PwC in April, the British economic growth rate in 2022 is expected to be between 2.8%and 3.8%, which is far lower than the previous expectations of 4.5%.  PricewaterhouseCoopers believes that the impact of the continuously overlapping epidemic in the epidemic situation will seriously drag the economic growth of British this year. With the continuous pressure of the supply chain and the tension in the labor market, the inflation rate in the UK may be as high as 8%this year.  A report released by the British Economic and Commercial Research Center on the 11th shows that the British will have the largest decline in living standards since the 1950s. Researchers said that digital models show that the actual disposable income of the actual households in the UK in 2022 will decrease by 3%, which is equivalent to the loss of 2320 pounds per household, which is about 19,200 yuan, which will lead to the living level of the British. Maximum decline. The main reason is that the growth rate of wages cannot keep up with increasing energy and fuel costs.  In various industries, different difficulties are constantly appearing. According to the Guardian, although the control of the epidemic has been liberalized, the government's tax reduction assistance and other measures for the service industry are also ebb, which has caused strong dissatisfaction with practitioners.  In the tide of inflation, consumers have found that many service industries are more expensive than before, which suppress people's consumption. In addition, the current British epidemic is still unstable, and the service industry operators such as restaurants and bars are still worried about infection and new anti -epidemic measures.  In the field of food production, the employment shortage caused by the epidemic still exists. According to the Guardian, many members of the UK warned that the government's restrictions on recruiting overseas workers and the shortage of labor caused by the COVID-19 outbreak have led to 500,000 vacant positions in the British food and agricultural sector. Among them, the skilled slaughterhouse workers It is particularly scarce. A large number of crops are rotten in the field, and livestock is cracked due to unable to handle. At the same time, the prices of fertilizers, feed and agricultural fuel are rising.  It is worth noting that the tourism industry that has always complained about the impact of the epidemic control. After the government suddenly liberalized the control, it was impacted because of insufficient preparation. According to the Guardian, the number of passengers in the UK ushered in a wave of strong rebounds. It should benefit the aviation and tourism industry, but the industry could not meet the surge in demand due to the lack of transportation and employees in the industry.  The Guardian said that since March 2020, thousands of employees in the British aviation industry have been fired or resigned, and the airport is now difficult to attract them to return to their posts. The more direct impact comes from the cancellation of a flight caused by the unable to get the COVID-19 virus infected by the crew members of the crew.  At the same time, since Britain chose ""coexisting with COVID-19"", international travel restrictions are different from most countries, and British Airlines said that about 2/3 flight destinations still need vaccination certificates or other required manual inspections need Documents have increased the time to go through the boarding procedures or at the border control office.","""Guardian""; British; England;"

Lu Hongzhou, a public health expert and dean of the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, said in an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 13th that if all the positive infected people can be found through the method of testing through the nucleic acid test, the centralized isolation treatment method is adopted. The ""inflection point"" of the epidemic should come.  At the press conference of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control Work on the morning of April 13, Wu Qianyu, a first -level inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission, reported that at present, the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control is in a critical period, and nucleic acids and antigen screening are continuously carried out. It is an important task to block virus spread.

It can also take care of the patient like the school learned, so that patients can trust the hospital and get careful care. At the age of 30, he believes that the lack of manpower and management vulnerabilities make the medical staff even have no time to go to the toilet, and the hospital is no longer a good place for patients to restore healthy. For a long time, medical staff chose to dedicate selfless dedication, so that this medical system can operate normally.  Over the years, German medical staff has remained silent, and this Berlin nurse now wants that medical institutions can have better medical quality. In the German hospitals and clinics, the nurse works every day in emergency. In recent months, more than 160 nurses from all over Germany told the media about their painful work encounters. They often cause tragedies that should not happen due to overload work. If the patient died in the emergency room because of failure to get timely treatment, the newborn fell to the ground in panic. It is very ironic that in recent years, the place that should have been cured and save people has become a dangerous place.  The root cause of this chaotic phenomenon dates back to the private wave of privatization in the German medical industry in the 1990s. Since then, the operation of German medical institutions has been guided by economic indicators. For managers, it is worth hiring more doctors, because hospitals can arrange more surgery to obtain rich income, and hiring nurse means increased costs. Therefore, this cost has been provinced for many years.  Since 2004, German hospitals will no longer be charged according to the number of patients' hospitalization days and the number of nurse required, but will be charged according to the number of surgery. At the same time, operators have intensified chasing profits. In 2012, every professional nurse in Germany must serve 13 patients. This number is only 7.7 in Sweden and 5.3 in the United States. Although this kind of situation has been changed later, the adverse effects have still existed. International studies have shown that the death of patients is positively related to the workload of nurses. ""The nursing of dignity is based on the working conditions of dignity.""  According to the questionnaire survey of about 2,700 respondents in Berlin Alice-Sharoton Applied Technology in Germany, nearly 40%of the nurses considered giving up this profession last year, and the 1/3 nurse hopes to reduce working hours. In addition, data from the German Hospital Association showed that the vacancy of 2,2300 nurses in the country last year was more than three times in 2016. Considering the continued increase in the COVID-19 epidemic and Ukrainian refugee patients, the situation has become worse.  In the night recently, a midwife in the Vavats Clinic in Germany has been busy and has been uninterrupted for 8 hours. Seven pregnant women to give birth to her and another colleague were so busy that she called the bell for a while, and the phone rang for a while. After a while, she went to another maternal place. Although it is not easy, it always guarantees that ""I am now.""  The midwife didn't drink anything within 8 hours, so there was no need to go to the toilet. She had to disappoint a woman who was beckoning: ""Unfortunately, there is no vacant delivery room now."" Another pregnant woman had to give birth to her dead daughter alone that night. In the abdomen. ""I can do my best to help her and her partner, resolve fear, sadness, and despair. But I do not do well because I have to leave her again and again.""

Even before the epidemic began to outbreak and followed the work in China and other places, the zero -industrial economic jobs of the ""Central Kingdom"" were increasing day by day. Such jobs often include a variety of short -term part -time or freelance positions. In China, when it comes to such work, people may think of takeaway brothers and Didi drivers.  At present, many young Chinese are engaged in some new zero -industrial economic work, including a variety of professions such as ""script killing"" screenwriter, shopping assistant, and sleeping hotline. Ding Dao, an independent analyst of the Internet industry, said that such occupations will become commonplace in China in the next few years. It is predicted that in 2036, 400 million people will become a freelancer in the zero -time economy.  Why does this change happen? Many young Chinese people want to work more flexible, rather than being restrained into a rigid attendance system. With the criticism of China's ""996"" work culture, this trend has continued for a period of time. To a certain extent, some sudden deaths of high -tech companies that have aroused media attention have become catalysts of this trend.  There are signs that this has attracted the attention of some large enterprises. A travel agency in China announced in February that the company will provide employees with a hybrid office system to allow them to live in their homes within a certain period of time. Of course, this trend is also affected by the epidemic. In the report of the ""Future Work in the Economy of the Post -Extraction"", the McKinsey Global Research Institute stated that the epidemic has ""the importance of improving the physical dimension of the work"" and has also accelerated the trend of transformation to remote work. According to the report, in the first half of 2020, China's e -commerce, express delivery and social media fields increased by 5.1 million.

This is related to the characteristics of the mutant strains of Omikon, and it is also related to us. 'Passing forward', early medical intervention related "". On April 13, Li Zhiqiang, the captain of the Shanghai Medical Team of Wuhan University, shared the experience of rescue the COVID-19 virus infection in Shanghai to help the Global Times reporter. Li Zhiqiang was the ""anti -epidemic veteran"" of the deputy dean of Wuhan living room in Wuhan living room in the Wuhan epidemic in 2020. He led the anti -epidemic team to achieve the anti -epidemic record of zero death, zero infection of medical staff, and zero recurrence of medical staff. But he admits that compared with Wuhan, this time in Shanghai, resistance in Shanghai is a new situation, and there are new challenges.  The larger scale of Shanghai's cabin proposes a new challenge  Beginning on April 3, Wuhan University Central South Hospital sent 51 medical staff to formulate Chi Chi to assist Shanghai, and entered the New Guobo Card Hospital of Pudong New District, Shanghai on April 6th to take over 1,300 COVID-19 without symptoms and light. Patients. Of these 51 people, 10 doctors, 40 nurses and 1 hospital experts, most members worked at the Leishan Hospital and Wuhan living room squares in 2020. They have rich experience in resistance to epidemic resistance. They are the core of Hubei. One of the anti -epidemic teams.  Li Zhiqiang recalled, ""Although most of the treatment of non -symptoms and mild infections this time, when the Shanghai Fang Cabin Hospital was treated, when he took over the W3 cabin on the first day, he felt that the patients were not easy. At that time, they had just entered the cabin, and may There will be some uncomfortable, and at that time, it was in the period of transfer with local medical staff in Shanghai. Previously, this square cabin was all Shanghai local medical staff. Now we are taken over by our foreign medical team. , So we are also trying to improve this situation. ""  At this time, the ""Wuhan Experience"" of resistance began to play a role. According to Li Zhiqiang, in order to alleviate the patient's tension, the medical players in the Shanghai medical treatment began to increase the visits in the ward. Once they saw patients with heavy anxiety, they took the initiative to communicate with them to comfort them. Medical staff who had worked at Leishan Hospital also moved the ""Comic Wall"" model of Leishan Hospital to Shanghai's square hospital. The nurse of the Shanghai Medical Team will draw some comics on the wall board to draw some comics that ""Hubei and Shanghai"" and ""joint guardianship, Shanghai refuel"" to soothe the patient's emotions. ""Many patients see our protective clothing with Wuhan University Central South Hospital Aid Shanghai Medical Team , I started to slowly have confidence. Some patients learned that we had taken over the Thunder God Mountain Hospital and told us, 'You are from Wuhan, and we must have more experience in this regard. "" Subsequently, some patients also began to leave a message on the comic wall, writing some thanks and cheering words.  In Li Zhiqiang's opinion, although he faced asymptomatic and mild infection in Shanghai's square cabin hospital this time, this does not mean that the treatment task will be easier than when in the Wuhan living room squares in 2020.  In 2020, the Wuhan living room squares can accommodate 1500 beds, which received support from 8 medical teams from Gansu, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai, Fujian and other places. 19 The most square hospitals with the most patients. This time, Li Zhiqiang led the team's total construction area of 300,000 square meters and 15,000 beds in the new Guobo Cabin Hospital of Pudong New District, of which more than 1,300 beds were in the W3 cabin. Another ""four -leaf grass"" square cabin hospital reconstituted from the Shanghai National Convention and Exhibition Center is expected to provide up to 50,000 beds. Li Zhiqiang said, ""Compared with the square cabin hospital in Wuhan, the size of the squares in Shanghai is obviously larger. Many of them are accommodating to be separated by tens of thousands of people at the same time. Work has a severe challenge. ""  ""Passing forward"", interfere with the treatment of high -risk people early  The press conference on the prevention and control of the Shanghai Epidemium reported on the 14th that the vast majority of the confirmed cases in Shanghai were light. At present, there are 9 cases of heavy types, all of which are treated in designated medical institutions. Qiu Haibo, a medical treatment expert of the Shanghai Working Group of the State Council ’s joint defense and control mechanism, said,“ One is divided into two views for severe cases, one is simply the development of COVID-19 virus from mildness to severe illness, and the other is multiple types of various types. COVID-19 in basic diseases will threaten life and health. ""  In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Li Zhiqiang said that there is no symptom -free infection or mild patients in the W3 cabin. This is also a difference between the Shanghai epidemic and the previous Wuhan epidemic. ""During the epidemic in Wuhan in 2020, some patients in Wuhan Fang Caval Hospital needed oxygen, and a certain percentage of patients eventually developed into severe illnesses. This time in Shanghai, we were basically asymptomatic and mild infected. So far, there have been no patients who need to be transferred to a designated hospital because of the heavier symptoms of the respiratory tract. Therefore, what we take is mainly in some physical condition monitoring, nursing and psychological comfort. Except for the Chinese medicine, there is basically no need to provide special specially provided the patients with special specialty. Drug treatment. ""  Li Zhiqiang revealed that in order to prevent the development of high -risk people who were infected, an important task for the aid medical team of Wuhan University Central South Hospital was to identify the changes in the patient's condition. High risks that mixed serious basic diseases and might change from mild to severe illnesses to severe illnesses to severe illnesses to severe illnesses Patients transfer to designated hospitals in time. ""This is not to say that infected people who find basic diseases must be sent away, but it depends on the degree of basic disease control. For example, patients with hypertension and diabetes, if they usually take medicine well, do not need to transfer. However, for those who have basic diseases and have poor control effects, such as tumor patients who are undergoing chemotherapy, low self -immunity, and patients with severe diarrhea, even if they have not developed to a severe level, the condition has deteriorated. In the trend, we must also transfer them to a designated hospital in time for medical intervention to avoid development into critical illnesses. ""  Li Zhiqiang believes that there are many infected people in Shanghai, but there are very few patients developing to be intensive. To a large extent, it is because of the use of this set of precise screening, early intervention, and ""passing forward"" diagnosis and treatment methods.  The average hospitalization cycle is 5-7 days  Wuhan University Central South Hospital aid Shanghai Medical Team took over the Shanghai Pudong New Area New Guobo Card Hospital W3 Curren in W3, which ushered in the first large -scale outlet on the 12th. Nearly 500 patients were collectively out of the cabin. Only 6 days have been taken over the patients to take over the patients in the cabin. Essence Li Zhiqiang said that the continuous positive time of the infected nucleic acid detection seems to be shortened than in the past. Generally, the infected people generally start to turn the yin after 5 to 7 days after entering the cabin. This standard and process are very clear. ""  Li Zhiqiang told the ""Global Times"" reporter that according to the standard of the cabin hospital out of Shanghai's unified square hospital, if the infected person was negative two consecutive nucleic acid detection results, and the sampling time was at least 24 hours away, combined with the doctor's comprehensive judgment of the symptoms, in line with The outlet standard will be allowed to be out of the cabin.  ""We will receive a list of standards submitted by the Shanghai Disease Control Department every day. Then we will review the symptoms of the recovery in the list one by one, and give a list of rehabilitation in accordance with the symptoms in combination with the symptoms. Relevant departments have re -reviewed again, and after reviewing, the final outlet list will be determined. We will prepare for the remedy's out of the cabin based on this final list. The relevant Shanghai departments will notify the districts to send cars to dock according to the number of people out of the cabin. ""  Jiang Rui, director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said that the discharged patients and the discharge of medical isolation observer were transferred to the residential place safely by the district through closed -loop transportation. All districts should clarify special forces, do a good job of information contact and transport with various medical institutions, and at the same time guide the residential (village) committees and property units of the residential residents of the discharged personnel to do a good job of explaining the relevant residents to ensure that they are not obstructed and refused.  For how the COVID-19 rehabilitation is returned to the community and family, Li Zhiqiang believes that whether it is a community or a society, there should be an attitude of acceptance, and you cannot fall into a blind panic. The awareness of protection that everyone really needs to establish is not to exclude patients with rehabilitation, but start with themselves and wear masks. ""Whether it is a recovery or a healthy person who has not been infected, you should have the consciousness of wearing a mask. This is both protection. I am also protecting others. Compared with unnecessary panic, everyone needs to act together to develop good hygiene habits.

This account cannot be counted on China,NA;,7,2022-04-16,59,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=DNPf6DgFiJsQfqLgxnf0t5jJG9a_9z9Eyq1-2nUy01Gb1cYmN-rEPdSpxC3s8j3_yPS42wwcVIF4-hiPHHzOmOFvXfhVVi104kxmXeNYF_crkb9Frh3rasKzokzVcbNk&uniplatform=NZKPT,"The COVID-19 epidemic continued to ravage the influence of Russia and Ukraine's conflict, adding more uncertainty to the prospect of the world economic recovery. Georgieva, president of the International Monetary Fund, said on the 14th that the relevant impact will lead to the reduction of the economic growth forecast of 143 economies this year. This was originally a cold and hot thing in the world, but some Western media had to make the economic recovery and the bottleneck of the global supply chain. The political manipulation of them since the outbreak of the epidemic has brushed some new coatings.  In the past two years, China has been the most resolute country that adheres to science and accuracy, the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", is the country with the most healthy health to protect the lives of the people, and the greatest contribution to ensuring the global economic recovery and supply chain. When the epidemic was raging around the world, China was the first to stabilize the epidemic, resume work and resume, and achieve a minimization of low mortality and economic interference. In the first quarter of this year, China's foreign trade imports and exports increased by more than 10%year -on -year, and it maintained positive growth year -on -year for seven consecutive quarters. From Apple mobile phones to Tesla electric vehicles, ""Made in China"" continued to supply blood to the global industrial chain arteries, providing ""China Determination"" in the world of ""black swans"" flying and ""gray rhinos"". The Bloomberg website recently published an article entitled ""Why the World's Zero-Covid Policy in China"" said that China's ""ZERO-COVID Policy"" benefited the world. Today, the excessive attention of some Western media on China's epidemic prevention policy has proved the weight of China in the global industrial chain from the opposite side. This weight is stable and consolidated by the epidemic situation.  It is also necessary to see that the impact of the ""suspension"" of Shanghai and other places was deliberately exaggerated by the West. First, closure is only temporary. As mentioned earlier, its effectiveness is verified. Second, China has a population of 1.4 billion, of which 267 million at the age of 60 and over, and more than 50 million elderly people have not completed the COVID-19 vaccine in vaccination. Patients such as severe basic diseases are ""eliminated naturally"" by groups. It is not only impossible to be accepted by Chinese society in terms of morality, and it will also bring more profound confusion in the economy. After paying a huge price of life, the United States and Britain and other countries still face the warning of ""recession"".  At present, the biggest interference for the recovery of the world economy is the overlapping COVID-19 epidemic in geopolitical risks, not scientific and precise resistance. Why are the global high -tech industries ""lacking cores"" and why energy and food prices have skyrocketed? Some people should be clear than anyone else. In 2018, the Trump administration launched a trade war to many countries including China, which opened the Pandora Magic Box, which has a global industrial chain, and its bad consequences are still fermenting. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the Fed continued to print banknotes and use the US dollar hegemony to harvest the global ""leek"", making the global economy face the risk of stagnation or even recession. Since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and Western have made limited restrictions on Russia, a large energy -producing country in Russia, enticing countries that maintain normal trade with Russia, and seriously interfered with international currency, financial and trade order.  In recent years, there are so many global economic storms in the West, and there are no few drops of rain points in several Western media; China has made so much contribution to the global economic stability recovery. How can the world be in the sin of ""cracking down on global trade"" in their mouths?  The anti -anti -epidemic and economic development of the economy have never been a ""two -choice"" choice question for China, but a must -answer question for ""double coordination"". Even in Shanghai, when multiple residential communities were seized, measures such as docks and partition closed operations, Shanghai Port still maintained all -weather operations all over the weather, and there were no some Western media so -called ""completely blocked"". The Chinese government is also working hard to take multiple measures to help enterprises open the ""medium obstruction"" in the transportation process to ensure people's production and life to the greatest extent. ""Efforts to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, and minimize the impact of epidemic on economic and social development."" Behind the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is the high attention to the economic and people's livelihood; After the epidemic, people see the production and operation activities of lightly playing.  Jilin Province is a major town of China's automobile industry. After realizing the ""social Zero-Covid"" of the epidemic prevention and control, it is promoting the upstream and downstream large, small and medium-sized enterprises upstream, small and medium-sized enterprises in the industrial chain to resume production; , I will definitely grab the lost time with a whip.

In addition to the daily life of people such as supermarkets, fast food restaurants, and pharmacies, it is the COVID-19 virus detection station that has sprung up like a bamboo shoot. Whether in large German cities, small towns, or even rural roads, the COVID-19 virus testing station can be easily found. At present, there are more than 1,000 COVID-19 virus testing centers in Berlin. The epidemic has seriously affected the lives of the Germans. Especially they enjoyed the closing of cafes, restaurants, and beer gardens that enjoyed relaxed moments, making them quite frustrated. Even if some stores are supporting it, the ""threshold"" of customers' entry is very high, and at least requires a negative proof of COVID-19 virus testing.  The ""Global Times"" special reporter's residence around the day of the noisy streets, after the epidemic, became quiet because of the closure of the store, including Marcus's coffee shop. Not long ago, the reporter passed his store but found a long line outside the door. After walking forward, I learned that the coffee shop has ""transformed"" COVID-19 virus detection station.  Entering the store, several employees were wearing masks, gloves, and white protective clothes to help the public make fast screening. Marcus told reporters, ""Community residents or people passing by can come in for fast screening. It can produce results in 15 minutes. Now, there are too many COVID-19 virus testing centers, and competition is quite fierce."" Macus said There are more than ten related testing centers within 100 meters around his shop, so the COVID-19 virus test center often engage in promotional activities. The Macus store provides customers with a small cup of hot coffee or mineral water. Some centers provide masks, disinfection water, hand wash, etc., which surprise customers.  The reporter interviewed throughout Germany and observed that in addition to coffee shops, bars, and restaurants to COVID-19 virus detection centers, a lot of COVID-19 is also provided by the fitness center, hotels, theater, chain furniture shops, gardening shops, exhibition centers and other places. Virus testing services are also ""standard"" at highway rest stations, pharmacies, and clinics. In addition, there are white tent testing stations on urban squares and shopping streets. Of course, the most popular is those mobile testing stations, providing testing services to the people on the streets of the city or rural roads.  The general test center is divided into two parts. The first is to fill in the form area. After the customer receives the form, in addition to filling in personal information, you must also fill in the history of COVID-19, and have recently been exposed to the COVID-19 patients. The second is to detect the area. Customers enter the inspection area according to the waiting number, and the staff will test it by the staff. After 15 minutes, the customer got the test results report. With the test report, customers can enter public places such as restaurants, cinemas. Inspectors are generally fixed employees of these institutions, but they have undergone short -term training. Health departments at all levels of Germany will conduct random inspections on test personnel, and those who fail to qualify will be disqualified.  The COVID-19 virus detection station appears everywhere in Germany, which is related to its ""low threshold"" and ""high income"". The German media recently quoted data from the German Federal Health Department that in order to maximize the screening of the public, Germany opened the license operation right to the COVID-19 virus testing station from all walks of life last March. The industry became the ""most profitable industry"" in Germany overnight.  How can we build a COVID-19 virus testing station? A supervisor of the Berlin Health Bureau said that as long as it completes the online course of collecting samples online, it can submit an application for the opening of the test center to the health department. However, it is much more difficult to get approved than last year. Generally, there are medical professionals as a guarantee guarantee.  Public data shows that the daily turnover of each COVID-19 virus detection center in Germany does not be less than 1,500 euros. Marcus also confirmed to reporters that the income of COVID-19 virus detection is much higher than that of coffee shops, and it is convenient to cause trouble. According to the unified standards of Germany, the testing station can get 18 euros for each customer for testing, of which 12 euros are labor costs and 6 euros are materials. The cost is finally paid by the medical insurance company and the German government.  Because it is too easy to make money, there are many inspection stations in Germany. A German TV previously disclosed that the number of detectors reported by some testing stations far exceeded the actual number of tests, and the test results were all negative. In this regard, the German health department has undergone investigations and punishment.  With the COVID-19 epidemic, the COVID-19 virus testing station has become part of the German life. Olaf, who works at a German company, said that his company also has the COVID-19 virus testing center. He detects almost every day.  ""Although the German epidemic is still serious, there are relatively few severe cases, which is related to the German test."" German scholar Stockr told reporters that as long as everyone does this, the infection can be found as soon as possible, and the doctor will be seen as soon as possible. This is also related to the deep detection culture of German society. Whether buying a car or traveling, the Germans like to compare and test it by themselves.

The major international media have reported the news as soon as possible, which is higher than the 4%growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year, and it is also good for the previous expectations of the outside world. In the difficult situation of the century -old epidemic, as long as it is not a ""geopolitical competition enthusiast"", no one will not hope that the Chinese economy will perform strongly in the heart, bringing good news to the world in confusion and anxiety.  It should be said that under the influence of super -expected factors at home and abroad, 4.8%of the growth in the first quarter is not easy. The Russian -Ukraine conflict ""moves the whole body"", so that the global industrial chain supply chain is worsened by the unstable global industrial chain. As the conflict is long -term, the global economy may be slowed down and high inflation. External pressure on China's economic development. In addition, the domestic epidemic also has the characteristics of many, wide and frequent, and increasing the difficulty of climbing the Chinese economy.  Overall, China's economic performance in the first quarter achieved ""stable door"". Driven by a series of stable growth policies, the main factors of investment, consumption, industrial added value, import and export and other main factors supporting economic growth in the first two months have strong rebounds, which greatly exceeded expectations. From the perspective of the whole quarter, the overall performance of the ""three -driving troiders"" can be described as powerful: in terms of import and export, although global trade is shrinking, China has maintained a growth rate of 10.7%; in terms of investment, infrastructure construction increased by 8.5%in the first quarter, Last year, this number was 0.4%; although the consumption was affected by the epidemic since March, the total retail sales of goods were severely impacted, but the entire quarter also achieved a 3.3%growth. Essence  These all show that the Chinese economy has not changed for a long time, the economic continuous recovery has not changed, and the characteristics of great development potential, sufficient toughness, and wide space have not changed. In the case of the downturn of the world economy, the Chinese economy is maintained as a whole It is quite strong tough.  However, the epidemic since March ""Chun Chun Cold"" slowed down some main indicators and the economic downward pressure has increased. This deserves great attention. The uncertainty caused by the epidemic is the most important factor in the impact and impact on the economy. How to stabilize the economic market and stabilize downward pressure will become a crucial task in the second quarter. The key is whether it can control the epidemic as soon as possible and realize the resumption of labor and re -production as soon as possible. This will largely decide the economic operation of the second quarter or even the whole year. If the epidemic is effectively controlled in May, it is entirely possible for economic operation to continue to rebound in the second quarter.  On April 18th, the national guarantee of the country's guarantee logistics promoted the industrial chain supply chain stable TV conference on TV conferences in Beijing. The meeting clearly requested that they strive to achieve ""people's livelihood must be supported, freight is unblocked, and the industry must circulate"". The Foreign Exchange Administration issued the ""Notice on Doing a Good for Epidemic Prevention and Control and Economic and Social Development Financial Services"", which proposed 23 policy measures from three aspects: supporting the trapped subjects, unblocking the national economic cycle, and promoting the development of foreign trade exports. While taking resolute and decisive measures to curb the rebound of the local epidemic, the impact of minimizing the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development is maximized. These are rivets made by the keels of the Chinese economy and the bow.  We also noticed that some overseas media and institutions questioned that China strictly prevented of epidemic prevention ""costly and unsustainable"", but they did not see that in the face of the century epidemic, China did not choose the short -term overdraft of ""change the future to today"". Zero-Covid ""itself creates good conditions for the long-term healthy development of the economy and society at a short-term price. The practice of Chinese anti -epidemic has also been further confirmed, and the ""tube"" was for better ""putting"". Solving the epidemic prevention and control and economic development, or even opposing, bias with a certain node to describe the overall appearance of China's economy, which is another long -term ""filter to China"" in the West. If the timing shaft is slightly stretched, it is not difficult to see that China must be one of the most stable major economies.  ""Stability"" is the most prominent keyword of China's economy in 2022. Under the influence of many uncertain factors, we must face up to difficulties, firm confidence, and unswervingly do our own things. Stress and challenges are the retirement of the pessimist, but it is the charge that the forge -time person is blowing.

Although this number increased by 1.3%month -on -month than the fourth quarter of 2021, which was better than the previous expected market expectations, some major indicators slowed down, especially in March's economic downward pressure. Public opinion generally believes that this is mainly due to the complex evolution of the world situation since March, especially the domestic epidemic situation has continued, and some sudden factors exceeded expectations. However, some Western media looked at the Chinese economy, claiming that ""the Chinese economy is in dangerous moment"", and even gloating the scourge that it was ""the price for the dynamic Zero-Covid '. However, many Chinese scholars interviewed by the Global Times on the 18th stated that the characteristics of China's economic development potential, sufficient toughness, and wide market space have not changed. Conditions achieve sustainable economic growth. The total import and export of China increased by 21.7%in the first quarter on the basis of a high -speed increase of 21.5%last year, especially exports increased by 13.4%, which shows the international competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing. What makes other countries envy is that China ’s consumer price index (CPI) in the first quarter increased by only 1.1%. Bloomberg recently said that ""China can give the West a lesson in response to inflation.  China's economic growth is facing challenges  According to AFP, the National Bureau of Statistics of China announced on the 18th that China's GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year. This number exceeded the predictions of Western media and economic experts. Bloomberg had previously estimated that China's GDP growth rate in the first quarter was only 4.3%, and Reuters was estimated to be 4.4%.  The Russian ""financial market"" website said that China is not easy to maintain economic growth. This number was obtained in some economic cities in China due to the closure of the epidemic in China. With the continued impact of Russian conflict on the global economy and the uncertainty of the epidemic, China needs to continue to work hard to achieve a target of about 5.5%of the year's economic growth. Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press conference on the 18th that China's economic operation in the first quarter was stable, but he pointed out that since this year, ""the international situation is turbulent, the global epidemic spreads, geopolitical conflicts have intensified, external instability The uncertainty has increased, the domestic epidemic is exuded, and some sudden factors exceed expectations, and the downward pressure on the economy has increased. "" It is reported that China is the earliest major economy in the world to get rid of the COVID-19 epidemic in the earliest to get rid of the COVID-19 epidemic. But with Omikon's outbreak this year, it brought a huge impact on the Chinese economy.  When asked if the epidemic in Shanghai and other places will affect the realization of the economic growth goal this year, Fu Linghui said that my country's industrial system is full, large -scale market space is wide, has more dividends in reform and opening up, strong economic governance capabilities, and can effectively cope with each of each. Risk challenge. From the perspective of the whole year, my country's economy is expected to resume the development trend.  The United States CNN reported that China's economic growth in the first quarter of China had benefited from the surprising good economic performance in January and February. The economic indicators of the past two months exceeded the predictions of analysts. However, the most serious epidemic in China has set out for two years in March, and a number of economic data have fallen sharply. For example, the retail consumption in March has decreased year -on -year. This is the first time in China since July 2020. The upgrade of the Russian -Ukraine conflict has led to the surge in international commodities and the impact of global supply chain. These have made economic growth more difficult in the next few months.  Yonhap News Agency reported on the 18th that the biggest uncertainties in the current Chinese economy are the epidemic. At present, 45 cities in China have implemented comprehensive or partial control due to the epidemic. It accounts for 25%and 50%of the total number of China, which will inevitably affect the consumer psychology of residents and the production of enterprises.  Some Western media have seen the sound of decline in the Chinese economy. According to the British ""Financial Times"", the Chinese economy is ""at a dangerous moment due to the outbreak of the outbreak due to the outbreak of the epidemic. Bloomberg, the United States, was gloating that economic data showed that China was ""paying the price for 'dynamic Zero-Covid'.""  ""The key is to stabilize confidence""  ""At present, the key to China's economic development is to stabilize confidence."" Chen Fengying, a researcher at the China Institute of Modern International Relations, said in an interview with the Global Times on the 18th that various economic data in the first quarter showed that the Chinese economy faced reality. However, considering the factors of the epidemic and international environment, the situation of China's economic development is better than before.  Chen Fengying said that in fact, China's economic data in the first quarter had a lot of highlights. First of all, the first industry increased by 6.0%year -on -year, of which the value -added of agriculture (planting) increased by 4.8%year -on -year. This proves that our food production is happy. At present, the global agricultural situation is not good, and the global food is lacking. We have food in our hands without panic. Secondly, the added value of industrial industries above designated size in the first quarter increased by 6.5%year -on -year, of which the added value of high -tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing industries increased by 14.2%and 8.1%, respectively. %, 10.2%. This proves that the Chinese economy has a good situation in the development of high -end manufacturing and new economy during the transformation process.  ""China's GDP growth rate will reach 5.6%this year."" Bloomberg quoted the forecast of international well -known investment banks Switzerland. The most important economic data in China is industrial production, not demand indicators such as retail sales. The investment bank believes that the impact of seal control on China's industrial production will be less than the impact on consumption; second, government and enterprise investment will grow strongly; third, despite the sluggish sales of real estate, housing investment is still growing. It is reported that the driving force of China's economy this year will be the investment of local governments and enterprises. The British ""Financial Times"" also said that compared with the weak consumption expenditure, China's industrial added value in the first quarter increased by 6.5%year -on -year. It is reported that industrial production is a major driving force for China's recovery in the 2020 epidemic.  ""The Chinese government has gained stable growth""  ""The Chinese government has grown steadily."" South Korea's ""Asian Economy"" said that the Chinese government has recently held a meeting frequently to introduce various measures to increase the stimulus of economic efforts. On the 18th, the Chinese government held a national television conference call to ensure the smooth flow of logistics to promote the industrial chain supply chain. Liu He, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and deployed ten important measures. Liu He said that it is necessary to issue a national unified nationwide permit; the nucleic acid test results will recognize the nation within 48 hours, and the implementation of ""采 is going to go and chase"" closed -loop management. Through 200 billion yuan of scientific and technological innovation re -loans and 100 billion yuan of re -loan for transportation and logistics, leveraging 1 trillion yuan of funds.  On the 18th, the People's Bank of China and the Foreign Exchange Bureau issued 23 measures to resolve the industrial rescue of the epidemic. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology also stated on the same day that it is hurrying to establish a ""white list"" system for key industries such as automobiles, integrated circuits, equipment manufacturing, agricultural materials, food, medicine, etc. The Financial Times quoted Sang Bo, the leader of the Emerging Markets team in Paris, saying: ""We believe that Chinese decision makers will be committed to ensuring the achievement of growth.""  Yao Jingyuan, the former chief economist of the National Bureau of Statistics, told the Global Times that exports, investment and consumption are economic growth. From a data point of view, at least two driving troops are powerful. From the perspective of exports, the entire world trade in the first quarter of this year was shrinking, and China still maintained a growth rate of 10.7%on the basis of 21.5%last year. At present, there are 432,000 market entities engaged in import and export trade nationwide, and the total number of employees involved is 180 million, which has made important contributions to stable employment. The second carriage investment is also growing significantly. In the first three months of 2022, the investment in fixed assets increased by 9.3%year -on -year, of which infrastructure investment increased by 8.5%year -on -year, and manufacturing investment increased by 15.6%. In particular, in terms of infrastructure investment, infrastructure investment in December last year only increased by 0.4%, while the first quarter of this year increased by 8.5%, an increase of many times. This will drive China's stable economic growth.  Adidia Matu, chief economist of the World Bank East Asia and Pacific, said that the Chinese economy has strong toughness. From the economic performance of the two years before the outbreak of the epidemic, once China controls the epidemic, its economic engine can quickly recover quickly Essence  What is even more envious of other countries in the world is that China maintains economic growth and the consumer price index (CPI) performs mild. Bloomberg recently stated that the inflation rate in the United States has soared by 8.5%year -on -year, and the inflation rate in the UK has also risen to 7%, which has reached a new high in decades. Judging from the latest inflation figures, developed countries are becoming a ""emerging market.""

Taking Austria as an example, at the beginning of the outbreak, experts and scholars appealed that the epidemic prevention policy cannot be ""one -size -fits -all"", but should be tilted to key groups such as the elderly. Junte Weis, director of the Department of Internal Medicine, Austria, even suggested that when the government provides maximum protection for the disadvantaged group, do not forget those groups that care for the elderly. He said: ""The nursing staff of each nursing home should take care of more than 10 elderly people a day, so it is necessary to detect their regular nucleic acid detection."" Austria has implemented the new version of the epidemic prevention regulations from April 16th. Only a few places still apply for compulsory forced compulsory Wearing a mask and the requirements for 3G certificates (nucleic acid testing, vaccination or rehabilitation certificate), including nursing homes and hospitals that are more concentrated in the elderly.  The mainstream European society did not agree with individual Western politicians who were similar to ""letting the elderly infection"". The Austrian government has repeatedly emphasized that ""the elderly are an important part of society and every family, and it is also the most affected by the epidemic. It is absolutely necessary to protect the elderly and to do everything we do."" It is worth mentioning that many social organizations in Austria are dedicated to solve loneliness for the elderly who live alone during the blockade of epidemic, prevent them from suffering from depression, anxiety and other psychological problems, and avoid epidemic prevention measures to bring secondary damage to the elderly.  In the past week, more than 8,000 French elderly people in public pension institutions such as nursing homes and long-term care centers were infected with COVID-19. The data given by the French government is that since the beginning of this year, more than 60 confirmed elderly people living in nursing institutions have left the world. ""Flexible and contradictory"" is the main characteristic of the French government's epidemic prevention and control policy, and it has also created a tragedy of the death of some elderly people. Since March 14, French catering institutions, cinemas, theaters, nightclubs and stadiums have no longer verified the vaccine permit. At the same time, the requirements of compulsory masks must be relaxed. We must wear masks only when entering medical places and taking public transportation. However, these policies have led to repeated again in the French epidemic in the past month. Recently, French President Macron told the media that the government is considering measures and other measures to restore vaccine permits.  Vaccination seems to be the only effective measure taken by the French government at this stage. At present, more than 90 % of the elderly over the age of 60 have been vaccinated with two doses, and about 70 % have been vaccinated. On April 7, the Ministry of Health of France announced that people aged 60 and above could vaccinate the fourth pins. 79 -year -old Gangbeita, who lives in the Bellville block in Paris, has contacted a good family doctor to prepare to take a reinforced needle recently. He told the ""Global Times"" reporter: ""I believe that the vaccine can protect me and my children well because this is science."" Chinese Noy Zhang, who settled in France, said: ""The vaccine is very tube and in France, and in France It is completely free for the elderly. ""  The protection awareness of European people is relatively indifferent. According to a reporter from the Global Times, the proportion of the elderly shopping in the ""Carrefour City"" supermarket in Paris wears masks is even lower than that of young people. An old man named Sebastian said: ""In addition to the spread of the epidemic, I am also worried about the rise in prices. Fortunately, we all vaccinated, even if you are worried, there is nothing to do."" But the French health department still Remind the people: Although vaccination is very important, it is not enough for the elderly people who have a basic disease.",vaccine vaccination; elderly people; outbreaks; elderly groups; wearing masks; elderly care institutions; death cases; Global Times; victim; victim;

Earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics of China just released domestic economic operation data in the first quarter, and 4.8%of the economic growth rate has become the focus of discussions at the annual meeting of this forum. At present, the world is facing a series of negative factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic, Russia and Ukraine's military conflict, and inflation. The economic difficulties have encountered supply chain security. How much will the Chinese economy play? How to solve difficulties such as supply chain? Where will the world economy go in the future? A number of participants and scholars put forward their views in an interview with the Global Times reporter.  ""No other countries can be as good as China""  A number of participants interviewed by the Global Times reporters believed that the Chinese economy in the first quarter achieved ""opening the door steadily"", and 4.8%of the GDP growth rate exceeded expectations.  Sang Baichuan, Dean of the International Institute of International Economics and Economics of Foreign Economic and Trade, believes that 4.8%still accelerates by 4.0%compared to 4.0%in the fourth quarter of last year. ""Many people think that China's economic toughness is full, and the long -term good situation remains unchanged. Obtaining control, preventing and controlling epidemic and promoting economic development can better achieve organic coordination, the toughness of China's economy will be further emerged. ""  As the world's second largest economy, the steady pace of China's economy is of great significance to Asia and the world, especially in the moment when the global economic recovery is weak. The ""Asian Economic Prospects and Integrated Process 2022 Report"" released by the Boao Forum on the 20th shows that the world's trade dependence on Asia has remained stable and its trade dependence on China has increased. Economys with China's largest cargo trading partner are widely distributed around the world, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Chile.  ""4.8%of China's GDP growth in the first quarter contributed a huge contribution to the world economy. No other countries can be as good as China."" Tesbera, the former executive minister of the Brazilian Ministry of Industry and Trade, told the Global Times reporter. It means that China has an impact on the global economy through international trade, and it also shows that China still promotes consumption, create employment, and increases the income of the people in China. Tesy predicts that China will also introduce a series of measures to expand consumption and employment and will actively help small and medium -sized enterprises affected by the epidemic.  ""Building high walls"" will split the global supply chain  The COVID-19 epidemic, which lasted more than two years, has seriously affected the stability of the global supply chain. Zhang Yuyan, director of the World Economic and Political Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview with the Global Times reporter at the Boao Forum for Asia. The fragility of the supply chain, many companies have adjusted from the perspective of improving the toughness of the supply chain, which has a reasonable side. However, some countries have politically politically, and even manipulate the supply chain as weapons for various purposes. ""In the future, we should actively build a global supply chain to achieve benefits of each country. The situation of 'building high wall' will split the global supply chain, and each country will be negatively affected."" Zhang Yuyan said.  Recently, the sanctions imposed on Russia in the United States have further combated the global supply chain order. The most intuitive influence is that Western countries and Russia close their leading airspace, which directly affects logistics and transportation routes. The website analysis of the Qatar Peninsula TV station believes that this means that some people choose to reorganize global trade according to the political route, ignoring geographical location and efficiency.  ""This behavior is a destruction of the global trade system,"" Zheng Yongnian, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and Dean of Qianhai International Affairs Research Institute, analyzed the Global Times reporter that the current global trade consensus The system created by a country is a system designed by the international community. The armedization of it at will is a very serious blow to the international economic and trade system.  The Asian region is making an example for the world. On January 1, 2022, the ""Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement"" (RCEP) officially took effect. The ""Asian Economic Prospects and Integrated Process 2022 Report"" believes that RCEP will promote the integration of regional industrial chain, supply chain and value chain. With the gradual effectiveness of RCEP, tariff barriers and non -tariff barriers in the region will be significantly reduced. Increase.  Former Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Huang Gencheng also delivered a speech on the forum that the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted the global supply chain, and all countries are looking for new ways and resources to obtain supply. In the face of this situation, it is very important to keep the market open and continue to welcome investment. RCEP and CPTPP will play an important role and benefit all economies involved.  China needs to explore how ""big and strong""  Facing the multiple tests brought by the more complicated and severe international environment and epidemic conditions, the forum can still hear the voice of optimistic about the Chinese economy. Li Baodong, Secretary -General of the Boao Forum for Asia and former Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, said that the steps of recovery in China, ASEAN, and India will still be significantly faster than the global overall level.  Xiong Aizong, deputy director of the Institute of World Economics and Political Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times reporter that when most countries in the world began to tighten monetary policy, China began to cut interest rates and reduce its standards. This indicates that China and developed economies are facing. The situation is different. The inflation rate in Europe and the United States and other countries is very high, but China has low inflation and relatively small debt pressure, which gives policy space.  ""It is expected that the Asian region can achieve a 4.8%growth in 2022, which is higher than the IMF expectations. This is not only a continuation of regional growth momentum, but also a manifestation of China's leading role."" Zhang Yuyan also said on the forum that China's economy accounts for more than 40%of Asia. If the 5.5%growth goal can be achieved, it is also of great significance to the entire Asian economy. """" "".  Speaking of future expectations, the former vice president of Renmin University of China, Wu Xiaoqiu, in an interview with the Global Times on the 21st that it has proven that reform and opening up have been proven to be a correct road in the past 40 years.

Zheng Yongnian said that China is now the second largest economy in the world, and the total economy exceeds the United States is just a matter of time. Therefore To accelerate the construction of a national unified market is a unified rule.  Li Yong, chairman of the board of directors of Huayong Investment Group, told the Global Times reporter that ""Strengthening the construction of a unified market in the country is not the 'retreat locking country' that some people claims, but China must recognize its value as the world's largest market, and so As a strong support for participating in international cooperation and competition.

"" Japanese commuters generally abide by these regulations, which makes trains during peaks usually drive in quiet.  The Japanese government and the people's continuous vigilance on the risk of COVID-19 virus infection will only make the country's long-standing ""carriage etiquette"" culture more common. These days, in the gyms and shopping malls in the center of Tokyo, they will find posters that are conducive to preventing infection from being conducive to infection. ""Silence is gold"" seems to be more social norms, and it is not limited to the compartment.  In fact, as early as the outbreak, lack of interaction between strangers is one of the lasting characteristics of Japanese society, which brings some negative effects. Many foreigners who have just arrived in Japan will notice that the Japanese maintain a sense of distance. Citizens in this country are one of the most impossible groups in the world to help strangers. The survey results show that many Japanese are lonely and cannot find people who can talk and dependence when they encounter trouble.  The psychological health of the Japanese has not benefited from long -term lack of interaction. However, because the country's COVID-19 virus infection rate and mortality rate is still lower than the global level, some people believe that Japan's ""indifferent culture"" is beneficial to public health. From voluntary self -constraints to avoid participating in excessive outdoor activities to universal high -level civilization behaviors, related cultures are considered to be a relatively small cause of Japan's epidemic.  The tendency of this stranger to maintain a sense of distance is conducive to showing the advantages of Japanese culture in terms of curbing epidemic. But continuing to encourage people to maintain silence and distance in public places, it may also offset any efforts to reduce anxiety and loneliness related to epidemics. If the Japanese government and the people still believe that indifferent culture is an effective means to maintain a lower infection rate, then without causing fierce cultural backbuilding, people will find fewer opportunities to find new friends, standing in strangers The barriers between them will only become stronger.  Japan's relatively successful resistance to the epidemic has caused some people's curiosity in other parts of the world. They want to know whether in some aspects of Asian culture in order to resist epidemic. If you talk to strangers at will in more places around the world as a kind of bad habit, then the ""Japaneseization"" caused by the public interpersonal relationship may sacrifice the people's mental health in order to repel the epidemic.",double -edged sword;

Hong Kong people attach great importance to eating, and the catering industry is particularly excited.

If all guests have a negative test result before departure, each group can be increased to 100. According to the Tourism Parliament, as of 4 pm on the 20th, more than 70 travel agencies requested the group to open a group, involving more than 50 new itineraries.  Under the ""vaccine pass"" policy, Hong Kong people must vaccinate at least one needle COVID-19 vaccine before entering the designated place. Two shots need to be vaccinated from April 30. Chief Executive Lin Zheng Yue'e reminded the employees and customers of the restaurant to comply with health protection measures and according to the requirements of ""peaceful travel"" and ""vaccine permits"". If they are not diet, they still have to wear masks.  According to the analysis, the fifth wave of epidemic in Hong Kong is gradually controlled, not the result of the so -called ""lying"" of the ""lying"" of the virus, but the result of the central government's full support and the results of the special zone government and all sectors of the society.

Since March alone, the local report COVID-19 infected people have exceeded 500,000 cases. The more at this critical moment, the more you must adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy, and to the greatest extent to ensure the safety and health of the people's lives.  To see, the essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast and accurate. The past experience proved that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" route that ""discovered and extinguished together"" was effective and correct. Now facing the characteristics of the Omicor Rongju mutation, it is fast, hidden, and short-incubation period. ""Hurry up and fast"" is still the key to prevention and control. In Guangzhou, ""picking stars"" on the 22nd, it was only about two weeks from discovering the epidemic, to decisive measures to extinguish the epidemic and restore normal production and life. This is another successful practice of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  It is also necessary to see that the concept of preventing and controlling the prevention and control of the epidemic in my country is ""people's first, life first"", epidemic prevention and control, normal production and life, economic and social development have never been opposed, but the relationship between complement each other and dialectical and unified. The impact of minimizing the epidemic on economic and social development, and minimizing the impact of the epidemic on the production and life of the people. This was originally the meaning of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". In other words, mechanical and simple ""one-size-fits-all"", regardless of the actual situation and the ""layer of layers"", is by no means a real ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  Omikon's mutant strains put forward higher requirements for ""early discovery, early reports, early isolation, early treatment"", which is also easy to make some places feel nervous, for fear that the district will become the part of ""breaking defense"". But this value and pressure should not be ignored, and the laws of science should not be violated. In some places, the highway is closed without authorization. In some places, there are no cases of infection and ""static management"". In some places, there are no epidemic conditions and farmers do not allow farmers to go down. Black ""and"" low -level red ""have been highly valued and are resolved according to law. At the same time, this tendency is also worthy of vigilance with ""extreme sealing to self -protection"".  The prevention and control of the epidemic should be in science. The ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" and zero infection, seal control measures, and full-member nucleic acid screening are equal to the same. Even when it comes to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it is thought of the city's sealing control and the city's full-member nucleic acid testing. In fact, the measures taken by ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" depends on the stage of the epidemic discovery. Only when the epidemic was found late, or although it was found earlier, it was not possible to take decisive measures in time. In the case, the control measures had to be used. Effectively identify and manage the source of infection, effectively block the transmission chain, and prevent the epidemic prevent the epidemic from spreading and a scale rebound. This is the scientific connotation of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  The prevention and control of the epidemic is focusing on coordinating. From the beginning of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the central government clearly proposed ""coordinating the prevention and control of epidemic and economic and social development."" Coordinating means that it is necessary to take care of the bulls and crack how difficult it is. You cannot ""care about the tail"", but you must ""play the piano in ten fingers"". The prevention and control of the epidemic is a systematic engineering, one is to control the epidemic, the other is to ensure the normal life of the people, and the third is to ensure that the economy and society must be operated. The three are indispensable. The prevention and control measures for epidemics should be strict, and the measures for people's livelihood protection should be warmed; people's livelihood protection is more temperature, and the prevention and control measures of the epidemic will be more effortless. In this sense, the prevention and control of the epidemic is not only a big test for the governance system and governance capacity, but also a direct test of the level of cadre and work style.  my country's anti-epidemic practice has fully proved that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with national conditions, science, and effective, and is the best practice of the concept of ""people first and life first"". Faced with the new challenges and tests, we resolutely overcome paralysis thoughts, mood, fluke, and elastic mentality, and resolutely oppose formalism and bureaucracy.

The newspaper stated that due to factors such as poverty, the vaccination rate of black children in the United States is low, so it is more likely to be hospitalized due to infection.  The impact of the epidemic on Japanese society is all aspects. It has made some already already existing social problems more severe, such as the ""children's poverty"" problem. A national poll at the end of last year in Japan showed that 30%of single -parent families had experience in buying food; 25%of the parents interviewed said that the current life is ""difficult"" or ""very difficult"". ""Ryukyu New News"" called for the disease that the epidemic caused a serious problem of ""poverty in children."" The government should raise children's subsidies, reduce tuition fees, and ensure that parents do not lose their jobs due to the epidemic.  While the Japanese government conducts financial support in the face of difficult families, it actively promotes children's vaccination. In late February, Japan launched vaccination work on children aged 5 to 11, with about 7.41 million people. As of April 21, 854,000 children who vaccinated the first dose of vaccine were 11.5%of the vaccination rate; 455,000 children were vaccinated with two -dose vaccine, and the vaccination rate was 6.1%. Obviously, the vaccination rate of Japanese children is not high. Japanese media call for the government to actively publicize and encourage parents to allow their children to vaccine. After all, only the vaccine vaccination rate increases can it help to more effectively curb the COVID-19 epidemic and better solve the problem of ""children's poverty"".  A public immunologist told the Global Times reporter that from the global perspective, the COVID-19 vaccination was still safer, and many vaccines were upgraded.",vaccine vaccination; children's poverty; sequelae; severe disaster area; Delta; vaccination; vaccine; vaccine;

According to a data provided by the Shanghai News Office, as of now, there have been 215,000 foreigners working in Shanghai, accounting for 23.7%of the country, ranking first in the country. In the face of this round of the Shanghai epidemic, these foreigners who live in Shanghai all year round have a hard time with the city with this city. The identity provides practical help for the citizens around him. ""Global Times"" reporter recently contacted the number of international friends who came forward in the Shanghai resistance in Shanghai to listen to them to share the sincere friendship they have harvested during the anti -epidemic process.  ""Hu Diao"" Lao Luo: I want to contribute to Shanghai  Speaking of emotions for Shanghai, the love of foreign teachers Jacobus is overwhelming. The Dutch who grew up in New Zealand has lived in Dongminghuayuan Community, Songjiang District, Shanghai for 13 years. The Chinese name is ""Luo Jiangqiang"". Everyone likes to call him ""Lao Luo"". During the Shanghai anti -epidemic process, Lao Luo's volunteer identity was a good story in Shanghai for a while. In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Lao Luo said that the Songjiang District of Shanghai where he lived was not only lined, neat and clean, but also special public security. ""Among the more than 2,000 households I know The theft has occurred. Songjiang is definitely the first choice in my life. ""  It is also because of the love of this preferred place that Lao Luo chose to become a community volunteer to defend his life in this epidemic.  In Lao Luo's opinion, he can become a community volunteer, and it is inseparable from the help of community volunteer Lu Yifan. Lao Luo recalled that when the epidemic in Shanghai was heating up at the end of March, Lu Yifan and the enthusiastic residents of the community jointly formed a volunteer team. Lao Luo and Lu Yifan were familiar with each other, so he took the initiative to find Lu Yifan, expressing his willingness to join the volunteer team. However, considering that Lao Luo and residents may have obstacles in communication, Lu Yifan was in a somewhat embarrassment at first. ""I want to make my own contribution to the community, why not?"" Under the persistence of Lao Luo, Lu Yifan finally asked Lao Luo to fill in the application form, and provided him with a set of protective supplies and the green vest of representative volunteers status. Essence ""I am very happy to be accepted as their"" comrades 'comrades', and our volunteers have also forged a deep friendship. ""Lao Luo said.  After the volunteer Lao Luo played, it helped his community to solve the problem of ""last 100 meters"" such as meat and vegetable noodles. At that time, the living materials in the community could only be transported to the east gate of the community, but the centralized distribution point was 500 meters away. Volunteers had to raise their shoulders to carry the goods at first, which was not only laborious and inefficient. As a result, Lao Luo took out several of his own carts for distribution of supplies.  Not only is it helping to distribute living materials, help nucleic acid testing, on -site recycling garbage ... Lao Luo is active everywhere. Lu Yifan praised him: ""I didn't expect that Lao Luo really helped a lot.""  ""Foreign Aid"" Lao Luo's dedication was affirmed by the Shanghai citizens around him. Lao Luo told reporters that he strongly felt the enthusiasm and friendship of Shanghai citizens. Many citizens continue to express their gratitude to Lao Luo and the same community volunteers like him, and thank them for insisting on helping citizens. ""A neighbor opened a bakery. He always sent cream cakes and fresh bread for our volunteer team. When our hard work was given such enthusiastic affirmation and reward, I felt that it was a volunteer It's really happy! ""Lao Luo said.  The old Shanghai Drifting, who worked in Shanghai in 1992, also said that the experience of working with the volunteers made himself clearly feel that the Chinese People's Long March and the Yan'an daughter during the period of the Yan'an period in the 1930s and That special emotional bond. ""On some cold nights, volunteers need to pack vegetables into shopping bags together, and then send them to residents. When the rain is hit on us, I feel that I have experienced the hardships experienced when the Red Army has experienced. Not easy and great. ""Lao Luo said.  ""Uncle South Korea"" Park Changzhu: When you come to Shanghai, find me!  Park Changzhu from South Korea has lived in Shanghai for nearly 20 years. He now lives in the Jinxiu Jiangnan Community, which is located near Korea Street, Hongquan Road, Minhang District. Korean residents account for about 1/3. In the prevention and control of the epidemic, the language does not have a lot of difficulties to the community. Park Changzhu took the initiative to ask for the community volunteers to set up a bridge to communicate with the residents of the neighborhood committee and South Korean residents.  In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Park Changzhu said that in the early days of the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020, he created 3 WeChat groups and more than 1,200 members. These groups are still active. Park Changzhu will translate the epidemic prevention measures and precautions of the neighborhood committee into Korean in a timely manner, and then convey it to Korean residents in the community through the WeChat group.  Park Changzhu receives 30-50 questions on WeChat every day: how to obtain new nucleic acid detection QR codes, how to buy daily necessities at home, what rules should be followed by home isolation ... Some of them can answer directly, and he can directly answer, and if you can't answer it, you can't answer it. Communicate to community staff. Sometimes, Park Changzhu will also share funny videos or music in the WeChat group to help residents relax.  When working as a volunteer, Park Changzhu sometimes maintains order and sometimes acts as translation. He also helped contact Korean companies to distribute ingredients for residents of the community. Although it is common to be busy in the early morning, whenever you see your neighbors sharing food made of these ingredients on social media, Park Changzhu will feel ""very happy"".  Park Changzhu told the Global Times reporter that in 2002, his son came to study in Affiliated Middle School of East China Normal University. Because his son was still young, he took this as an opportunity to settle in Shanghai. He said that we are used to life in Shanghai and will always live in Shanghai. ""Come to Shanghai, find me!""

The general representative of the Hungarian National Museum in China and CEO of Bailu De Information Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Steven Back, has lived in Shanghai for nearly 20 years. contribute.  In this round of the Shanghai epidemic, Besie and his wife both served as volunteers, mainly to assist residents in the community for daily routine nucleic acid testing. In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Beswen said that his wife had done volunteers for a long time and joined himself ""naturally."" However, there is also his heart behind this as the ""new Shanghai"".  Long -term isolation may be affected by the mood of some residents. In order to alleviate everyone's anxiety, Bediwen, like the aunt of the neighborhood committee, took the ""big horn"" broadcast and told the residents that ""our community is fine"". ""I just want everyone to smile."" Besvan said.  In April, Shanghai sometimes was as high as about 30 ° C during the day. Wearing a protective service for 9 consecutive hours was a ""arduous work"". Beswen said with a smile, ""It's nothing.""  The residents of the community felt ""very fresh"" about seeing ""foreign big white"", took the initiative to wave him, took a photo with him, recorded the video, and sent him WeChat to say ""thank you"" afterwards. Knowing that Bediwen came from Hungary, and the ""painter"" drew the national flag of China and Hungary on his protective suit. Beswen told the ""Global Times"" reporter that the ""cooperation"" of individual residents was ""not high"", but he ""never encountered this situation"", everyone was ""particularly friendly"" to him.  It is worth mentioning that Bediwen also organized a ""Elysium City"" balcony concert in the community, attracting more than a thousand people to participate, and the video quickly spread on social media. Bediwen said that music is sometimes better than language. In addition to physical health, we must also consider mental health. It is hoped that the form of a balcony concert will help community residents ""dispersal.""  ""The epidemic will always pass. When the volunteer is temporary, the interaction of the troubles formed by the neighborhood is eternal."" Hungary does not have the concept of a ""community"", and in Shanghai, Bediwen feels the ""community spirit unique in China """" "". Besvan said that they had made an appointment and ""organized a group to travel to Hungary after the epidemic.""  The status quo of the Shanghai epidemic  The Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission reported on the 24th: At 0-24 on April 23, 1401 cases of 1401 confirmed cases of local COVID-19 and 19,657 asymptomatic infected were added, of which 541 cases were confirmed as asymptomatic infections. 816 confirmed cases and 19,421 asymptomatic infections were found in isolation control, and the rest were found in the investigation of relevant risks.  Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission, introduced at a press conference of the Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control on the 24th that since this round of epidemic, there have been 87 cases of death in Shanghai, including 48 men and 39 women. Age 81.10, the maximum 101 years old.  According to Zhao Dandan, in general, after the elderly infected with the COVID-19 virus, it was easy to progress into heavy and critical types, and the difficulty of treatment increased.

Although many people were isolated at home because of the COVID-19 epidemic, their fitness enthusiasm was driven. In addition to Liu Genghong, many celebrities who are also separated at home use their talents to contribute the positive energy under the epidemic.  Single live broadcast traffic reaches one million  More than a month ago, Liu Genghong, an artist from Taiwan, was only ""Jay Chou's Dead Party"" in the eyes of people. There were not many audiences who heard him singing and watching his show. However, now he has become a social network with 40 million fans. The platform ""Red Man"" is surprising. With years of performance experience, Liu Genghong now let the whole network see the charm of his ""fitness expert"" -a single live broadcast traffic reaches one million, and many ""Liu Genghong girls"" and ""Liu Genghong boy"" appeared on the Internet. The ""star private education"" fitness also waited for him to change the ""fitness operation"" online.  The oolong incident that Liu Genghong appeared in the live broadcast ""Due to too much chest muscles and had to wear down jackets to fitness"", and even became a topic of talked about people. Although Liu Genghong's fitness content is not particularly dazzling, such a high heat has never appeared in the previous fitness live broadcast. Liu Genghong's popularity can be described as time and place. He has already focused his work on the mainland. The development of his career has always been tepid. He happened to catch up with the dual desire for entertainment and fitness during the epidemic sealing. The coach style of the ""style, the people's mother -in -law's relatives and the people, and the connection with the connections with stars such as Jay Chou, Ying Caier, Zhong Liti, etc., helped him to make a circle and become the most popular artist in April. However, the more important thing is that Liu Genghong passed the positive and optimistic positive energy to netizens through the live broadcast of home fitness, which made people have a healthy body and a relaxed mood to defeat the epidemic and return to normal life.  ""The old drama bone is too grounded""  Star artists who bring positive energy to netizens through live broadcasts are far more than Liu Genghong. Li Liqun, a senior actor in Shanghai, also shared his own sealing life with the majority of netizens this time with short videos. ""Everyone smokes less, not because of anything else, after all, the inventory is not enough."" Li Liqun, who is nearly old, uses the familiar voice of the audience to introduce daily chores and family members around him every day. It is no different, making netizens feel very kind: ""Living in Lujiazui, but drawing a few dollars in the front door, the old opera bones are too grounded!""  Not only the older predecessors, but also Peng Yuyan also passed positive energy in low -key in the younger generation. He stayed in Shanghai during the epidemic, and cooperated with other residents to go downstairs as nucleic acid. The band fish distributed by the community streets shared their positive and optimistic attitude.  In addition, there are many artists in various ways to show how they actively face the epidemic seal: Li Caihua practiced skateboarding at home, Qin Hao patiently counseled his daughter's homework, Ying Caier made a barber for his son, Chen Haomin encouraged his wife to organize community group purchase, Zheng Xiyi gave her daughter a birthday Wu Zun did not forget to show the antigen, Yan Yikuan self -cultivated vegetables, Carina Lau community made nucleic acid ...

The number of home isolations is nearly 90,000, which has tested Taiwan's medical resources. On the 25th, Chen Shizhong, a Taiwan epidemic commander, announced that the home isolation was changed to ""3+4"", that is, ""after the 3 Tianju family isolation period expires, it will be used for 4 days of autonomous epidemic prevention.""  Taiwan Media: There may be 1800 people who died  On the 25th, 5108 cases were added to the island. Among them, the number of diagnostic people in New Taipei City and Taipei City exceeded a thousand, and 113 were added overseas inputs. As of the 25th, 87,000 people on the island were isolated at home.  Taiwan's epidemic commander Chen Shizhong quoted the prediction of the ""National Institute"" that the highest peak on the island will come, and 45,000 people will be diagnosed in a single day. The cumulative epidemic in Taiwan will be diagnosed by about 3.6 million to 5 million. As for how high the mortality will bring, he said that New Zealand's mortality rate is about 0.05%, and South Korea is about 0.7%-0.9%. The Taiwan epidemic will be similar to New Zealand. Taiwan media estimates that if the diagnosis of 3.6 million people is calculated, Taiwan is equivalent to 1,800 people who will die in this epidemic. Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe estimates that after the number of new diagnosis every day reaches 50,000 examples, it will last for 100 days, from 50,000 cases to 1,000 cases per day. The process may take more than two months.  The internal epidemic of the Taiwan army was also spreading, and the first general diagnosed on the 25th. According to Lianhe News Network, a Lieutenant General Defense nucleic acid detection was positive, and on the 25th, the internal luggage was performed for nucleic acid testing. The Central General's office is in the ""Ministry of Defense"" Boai Building. He meets with the ""Minister of Defense"" Qiu Guozheng every morning and afternoon. It is said that Qiu Guozheng is also screened. The ""Ministry of Defense"" issued a press release confirmed that some generals did have a positive test after nucleic acid testing due to physical discomfort. At present, home isolation. The nucleic acid detection of close contact with personnel is negative and normal.  The new local confirmed cases have repeatedly renewed high, causing concern to the public. The latest polls announced by the ""Beautiful Island Electronics News"" on the 25th show that the cause of this epidemic outbreak, 79.5%of the respondents believe that ""the public does not know that it is confirmed, so the infection expands"", followed by ""this virus this time. ""Infectious power is too strong"" (73.3%), ""loose people's epidemic prevention attitude"" accounts for 66.7%, ""the authorities' epidemic prevention policies are unclear"" accounted for 50.2%, ""the Executive Yuan did not prepare in advance in response to overseas epidemics"", accounting for 47.8% 38.2%of the three -level alert ""accounts for 38.2%,"" the Ministry of Education is too relaxing schools at all levels to suspend courses ""accounts for 32.9%, and 2.8%of the people have not explicitly answered.  ""3+4"" is officially implemented today  Facing the severe epidemic, the Taiwan Epidemic Prevention Command Center met with the county and city heads and experts on the 25th after discussions, and will implement the new regulations of ""3+4"" isolation. It was formally implemented on the 26th. At present, those who have been isolated at home for more than 3 days can start to remove isolation or autonomous epidemic prevention on April 27.  Chen Shizhong said that the previous three days must be isolated at home. The principle of ""1 person and 1 room"" is based on the principle of ""1 person and 1 room"". After the three Heavenly House isolation periods are negative, they will be autonomous prevention. During the autonomous epidemic prevention period, fast screening must be performed every day. Those who are negative can go out to work and buy a necessity of life. We must wear masks throughout the process; prohibit the restaurant's meals, dinner, gathering, and traveling to crowded places with unspecified objects. You can take a mass transportation, but wear a mask. Once violated the regulations, a fine of NT $ 1 million can be punished. Those who are fast -sieved are prohibited from taking mass transportation, but they can drive, cycling, or family and relatives to take them. If the medical location is relatively close, you can walk without going through, without arranging the sanitary unit.  In addition, the original diagnosis needs to trace the history of tourism, but now it is only a colleague who lives with relatives and friends, classmates in the same class, and colleagues who are close to the office or workplace in the same workplace. In order to prevent overseas mutant strains, the home quarantine in Taiwan still maintains the ""10+7"" regulations.  The reason for the implementation of ""3+4"" is that the current medical resources on the island are seriously inadequate. Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe said on the 24th that the Zhongshan District Office of Taipei City alone followed the three types of people including home quarantine, home isolation and home care. There were 2,900 people, ""this is a huge burden."" Chen Shizhong also said on the 25th that forced to change from 10 days of isolation to 3 days, the intensity of life care is reduced, and the use of electronic form notifications also reduce the work. Medical manpower is transferred to the level of medical treatment, giving greater care for home care and dedication. He also said that the scale of the epidemic in the future expands, and the timely simplification of home isolation can be considered in a timely manner. Another plan is ""fast screening replacement home isolation"", otherwise the increase in diagnosis cases will increase too fast and increase social pressure.  However, public opinion on the island is obviously not so optimistic. Huang Shanshan, deputy mayor of Taipei City, said on the 25th that ""3+4"" has no substantial significance for Taipei. Now thousands of cases are diagnosed every day. Can't open it, ""this is not feasible."" Lin Shiyi, a major infected subject of the front desire, posted on Facebook that the wife of the child infected by a pediatric infected department performed a nucleic acid test for 20 children in a hospital in New Taipei City. The home isolation is a bit too rushing for 3 days. At this stage, it should be more suitable for 5 or 7 days. "" Qiu Zhengxuan, deputy dean of Linkou Chang Geng, said that the virus volume of the diagnosis usually dropped to a very low virus volume, and the intimate contacts usually have another two or three days. Therefore It is a bit scared. "" Huang Gaobin, commander of the Central District of ""Ministry of Health and Welfare"", believes that the ""3+4"" plan is too fierce. At present, local cases account for 0.2%of the Taiwan population. Sixty %, that is, four adults can be infected; once the number of people increases, it may lead to severe illness or even mortality.  Yahoo's website conducted a network poll on the 25th the title ""Do you agree with 3+4 to replace the 7 Heavenly House isolation"". As a result, 18.7%of people said they ""agreed very much"", 25.2%""still agree"", 18.5 18.5 %""I don't agree"", 21.8%""completely disagree"", and 15.8%""do not know or have no opinion."" The data shows that 3+4 accounts for about 43.9%and approximately 40.3%of the disagreement.

Recently, several foreigners living in Shanghai were interviewed by a reporter from the Global Times, telling his true ""isolation"" life. Among them, there are tenderness and movement, and the goodwill and understanding of the ""second hometown"" of Shanghai, the ""second hometown"".  New Zealand media people: Shanghai has no choice but to defeat the epidemic situation  ""At home isolation for many days, I feel like an epidemic prevention expert!"" Andy Boreham, a New Zealand media person who has lived in Shanghai for nearly 10 years, began his isolation life on April 1. He said that even when he saw the Shanghai epidemic change and the number of infections surged, he didn't particularly worry, he said he said because he knew China.  ""I believe that Shanghai can eventually defeat this epidemic. Previously, Shanghai was one of the safest cities in China. Shanghai experts accumulated full experience in responding to overseas input cases in the past two years. Let them return to their hometown healthily. ""An Bairan can be said to be a China Tong, visiting many places in China. He posted a video on Twitter to refute various prejudices and rumors in the West and was stigmatized by the attack of Western media. Twitter even labeled him with the ""Chinese official media"".  Anboran said that although he has lived in this community in Shanghai for five years, he rarely contacted his neighbors before. Unexpectedly, in just a few weeks during the isolation period, he made some new friends through the WeChat group. ""Many people add my WeChat and ask if I need help, which is really warm. If we unite us, we all know that this experience is not common in apartment life in big cities. ""An Bairan also participated in the group purchase activities of the community and participated in neighborhood assistance activities with neighbors.  Anboran said, ""I know what these reports will say about the report of the Shanghai epidemic report. When the development situation in China is good, these Western media reports are bad enough, and when the city in Shanghai falls into it In the predicament, you can imagine how bad their reports can be. ""An Bairan insisted that"" this time, Shanghai has no choice but to defeat the epidemic. ""  French chef: make ""home food"" with me  For many Chinese audiences who love food, French chef Corentin Delcroix is a ""old acquaintance"". He has appeared in multiple TV programs, with nearly 4 million fans on his personal social platform. For Dai Guangtan, it is necessary to make the isolation life happy.  Dai Guangtan is a ""Shanghai son -in -law"" who has lived in Shanghai for 14 years. In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Dai Guangtan said, ""The city in Shanghai is full of vitality and the rhythm is fast. It is an excellent choice for entrepreneurs."" Seeing that his beloved city was stopped due to the epidemic, Dai Guangtan felt ""unfortunate"". In particular, seeing some foreign netizens' prejudice and attack on Shanghai and Shanghai people made him ""very distressed"".  The Dai Guangtan family living in Huangpu District was also troubled by the nervousness of materials in the early days of the epidemic. Dai Guangtan said, ""Fortunately, I am a chef, and I have a lot of reserves at home. But for a while, I can only eat eggs, cabbage, cabbage, and eggs."" Later, when the group purchase was running, the material problem was obtained to a certain extent. Solution, Dai Guangtan began to ponder: how to make food with simple ingredients under limited conditions. Dai Guangtan began to release ""home food recipes"". In addition to the ""simple version of chocolate cake"" in Western food, he also taught everyone in the video to cook Chinese food, such as ""self -sufficient and self -sufficient mixed fried powder"", ""roll -roll casual cake"", ""vegetarian crab powder Xiaolongbao"" Wait, even shared the method of making tofu and pickling sauerkraut at home. He said that he would feel very happy to see everyone commented ""Learn this food"".  Dai Guangtan told the Global Times reporter, ""Seeing that the number of deaths in France and the United States is so high, even if we are not a doctor or professionals, I also understand the differences. I think that if we can protect the lives of the elderly, even if it isolate for three weeks, One month is also worth it. Although this will make life very inconvenient, it is also very meaningful. ""  Teacher Shangwai: They can't understand  ""'Friends' has an explanation: 'month' is 'meat', 'friend' for 'hand -pulling'. This means 'friend' is"" I will give you meat, you can make me meat, walk your hands together, "" It can be described as 'to see the true feelings'. "" Muhmoud Soliman from Cairo, Egypt, received a PhD in Shanghai University of Foreign Languages. He stayed in the Arabic Department of Oriental Institute as a foreign teacher and has lived in Shanghai for more than 5 years. He expressed his feelings in the epidemic with the interpretation of the word ""friend"".  In an interview with the Global Times reporter, Ma Xiaoyu said that Shanghai is an international metropolis with tolerance. Although his roots are in Egypt, many friends from China and other countries have been formed in Shanghai. He has ""true feelings"" in Shanghai.  During his home isolation, Ma Xiaoyu said that the only inconvenience for him was ""can't drink milk tea"" and ""can't eat hot and spicy"", and he had to make himself. ""This also made me live a healthy life."" Ma Xiaoyu told reporters that he used ""home fitness"" during this time, practicing abdominal muscles, arms, and shaping his shoulders, and ""carved muscle lines."" After the end of isolation, he hopes to appear in front of students with a healthy and good image. Ma Xiaoyu joked that if a student called him ""male god"" and asked him how ""how his body became so good"", he would """" Versailles "":"" Just grow casually. ""  When talking about ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" or ""lying flat"", Ma Xiaoyu had his own opinion. He told the Global Times reporter that the perspective of foreigners, foreigners living in China, are ""completely different"" from foreigners who are not in China. As a large population country, ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the most suitable policy choice. Prior to this wave of Shanghai epidemic, the life of the Chinese has basically returned to normal. It can be said that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" policy effectively protects the lives of Chinese citizens and foreign citizens living in China.

A BBC (BBC) on the 26th on the island's banking industry """" The report of the process has attracted the attention of Taiwan media.  The BBC said that Taiwan's banks are full of dynamic pipelines, endless documents, and name seals of passbooks, endless documents. ""The banking industry in Taiwan is very traditional."" Sharon Su, the financial adviser of the Taipei Kai Tak Law Group, described that Bank of Taiwan has many bureaucratic issues and is more rigid than other industries. In 1989, Taiwan's banks carried out major reforms, and the first private bank was allowed to open. Before that, they were all public institutions. The article believes that the ""heritage"" of this public bank is also a reason why it has failed to keep up with the times.  This ""inheritance"" is reflected in all aspects of the Bank of Taiwan. For example, even if the authorities have approved the business through electronic documents, some banks will refuse to adopt this method. David Staton, a project researcher at the Taiwan Financial Research Institute, believes that the process of new means of application of Bank of Taiwan is very slow, and one of the reasons behind this stagnation may be that most local customers are already satisfied with the current traditional operation. Even if you need to line up to get the passbook and wait for money. At the same time, banks are also easy to meet the needs of SMEs that dominate the Taiwan economy, all of which make services lack the motivation to update.  The Taiwan banking industry has improved slowly, and to a large extent, many financial needs have been met outside the bank. Many Taiwanese use LINE PAY, Apple Payment and WeChat Pay daily. Even if customers use online banking, banks are still much behind competitors, because convenience store companies such as 7-11 and family are expanding in the field of digital payment.  It is not uncommon for the ""use seal"" mentioned in BBC to handle business. He said that before the epidemic, he often went to the mainland and his hometown Tainan, and sometimes he felt uncomfortable with different procedures for banking business. After the outbreak, he had not returned to Taiwan, but he found that he can now handle some business in his hometown through the Internet or mobile phone. Mr. Guan, a Taiwanese businessman who has been stationed in Guangdong and has returned to Taiwan, said that he would use traditional passbook methods and mobile phone electronic banks. He still retained the passbook is to ""prepare from time to time."" He told reporters that electronic banks became very convenient during the epidemic, but if they went to buy things to pay for electronic payment, he said that there are more ways such as LINE PAY and other ways, and they will not use mobile banking deliberately.  The COVID-19 epidemic has indeed led to the development of Taiwan's banking industry to some extent. Those users who originally needed to handle business also began to consider using online banking and bank APP. According to statistics from the Taiwan authorities, as of the end of 2019, the number of electronic deposits accounts on the island was only 3.83 million, and by the end of 2021, this number increased to 10.47 million.",The banking industry;

""Beijing is against Omikon."" The Wall Street Journal said on the 26th that the Chinese capital will continue to expand for compulsory COVID-19 testing scope, including all urban areas in the city. Based on the testing of nucleic acid tests in Chaoyang District, from April 26 to 30, 11 regional personnel such as Dongcheng, Xicheng, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijingshan, and Fangshan have conducted three rounds of nucleic acid testing. ""Nanhua Morning Post"" said that about 20 million people in Beijing live in these areas. This is the largest detection in Beijing since the beginning of the epidemic. The Beijing Municipal Government vowed to fight and control the active battle, and resolutely curb the risk of epidemic dissemination.  The Associated Press reported on the 26th that in just two days, Beijing expanded large -scale testing to almost the entire city. ""The announcement of large -scale testing caused the panic purchase of the residents of the city on Monday, but the situation seemed to be calm on Tuesday. Public transportation basically maintained a normal schedule, and the road was full of commuters."" The report quoted the work in the aviation industry. Mr. Zhang, a resident of Beijing, said that he did not hoard food because he did not want to exacerbate supply shortages. He supports the government's strict testing, isolation, and mask wearing measures. ""Large -scale testing is a very effective measure, and I will cooperate with government requirements."" Mr. Zhang said. A graduate student named Zhang in Haidian District interviewed by the Australian SBS Broadcasting Corporation said: ""I am making the worst plan."" He bought dozens of snacks and apples about 5 kg on the Internet.  ""One -handed nucleic acid, one -handed stock"" - ""Wall Street Journal"" stated that the news about all residents of Chaoyang District before this week will cause panic buying for people's panic, which has intensified concerns about the city's sealing. However, in the stores and supermarkets in Beijing, food is not completely out of stock. Zhao Weidong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said that the current over -daily stocks in Beijing are more than 5 times. In response to the demand for market eggs, Beijing began to launch 100 tons of government egg reserves on the 26th. At present, there are sufficient reserves of various necessities.  From 16:00 on April 25th to 16:00, 22 cases of new local COVID-19 virus infections were added in Beijing. The Wall Street Journal stated on the 26th that Beijing is currently in order to curb the epidemic of new outbreaks and avoid repeating the strict sealing and control of Shanghai to cause chaos, economic interference, and public dissatisfaction. It is reported that although the number of new cases in Beijing is still small, the rapid spread of this round of epidemic dissemination makes the Shanghai Municipal Government overwhelmed and fully reminds people that the contagious Omikon mutant strain encounters China. What will happen when the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" resistance policy will be. Through the rapid test of large -scale nucleic acids in Beijing's large regions, government departments may be able to cut off all transmission and spread pathways before the epidemic spreads.  On the 26th, a new round of large -scale nucleic acid tests for citizens also started in the drizzle. A Beijing immunologist who did not want to disclose his name told the Global Times on the 26th that this test may provide data for Shanghai's next restriction policy to relax the restrictions in certain regions in Shanghai. On April 25th, 1661 new local COVID-19 confirmed cases and 15,319 cases of no symptoms were added. Zhao Dandan, deputy secretary and deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of Health and Health, said on the 26th that the current situation of the Shanghai epidemic situation is generally stable and good, but the foundation is not firm.  Russia reported on the 25th that most residents in Shanghai were still isolated at home due to China's ""zero tolerance"" policy on the epidemic. Initially there were difficulties in food supply, but the situation in the past week has improved, because large retail chain stores have restored commodity distribution in multiple regions. The local government acknowledged that the situation was still severe, but also pointed out that ""a positive situation has occurred."" According to reports, according to predictions, the home isolation of most Shanghai residents may end in early May. By the middle of next month, the life of this metropolis may begin to return to normal.  Some Shanghai citizens said on the 26th that as the government has doubled its efforts to ensure that the supply is sufficient and the transportation is smooth, the new mode of distribution such as smart express vehicles and other communities will appear, and the supply of material supply is not so serious. ""More and more platforms have increased the supply, and now they can basically get what we want through community group purchase.""

Under the epidemic, the increasingly serious ""female poverty"" problem has also attracted the attention and reflection of Japanese public opinion. In 2020 when the COVID-19 epidemic was outbreak, the number of women employed in Japan decreased by 240,000 compared with 2019. Some women fell into economic difficulties, and data that women encountered domestic violence and suicide also increased. In order to solve the problem of ""women's poverty"", Japanese cross -party members have jointly submitted the ""Difficult Women's Support Act"" to Congress. Japan's ""Daily News"" commented that ""the COVID-19 epidemic highlights women's dilemma, and if the new law is established, it will be the first step to strengthen the establishment of a supporting women's mechanism.""  Ms. Chuanhe, who lives in Kanagawa Prefecture, raised two children. She told the Global Times reporter that there was not much attention to the ""female poverty"" issue before, but after the outbreak, many female colleagues who worked together were either dismissed or salary reduction. Although the epidemic has an impact on men, women suffer more difficulties than men. She believes that if you want to solve the problem of ""women's poverty"" under the epidemic, it is not enough to rely on a law, and it is necessary to work together in the whole society. A Japanese folk organization called the ""bond"" has been distributed for free food near the Tokyo government since last weekend to help those homeless people and children and children who live in trouble.  The situation of European countries is obviously much better. When the COVID-19 vaccine supply is limited, in European countries such as Austria, elderly people over 60 are the most priority group. In addition, key groups such as medical staff, nursing home caregivers, primary and secondary schools and kindergarten teachers, and basic diseases are also priority. Such policies have formed effective protection for them.  The Russian epidemic prevention expert Glalov recently reminded the public that it is too early to say when COVID-19 may become seasonal diseases and how to end it. Russian immunologist Kuichkov said that the incidence of the Russian COVID-19 virus may rise slightly in spring and summer this year, and there may be a serious surge in autumn, ""everything depends on the strength of the virus itself"", so Never relax epidemic prevention. The Russian Ministry of Health said that the COVID-19 virus continued to threaten the health of citizens, especially those in danger. Russia's ""Communist Youth League True News"" lists ""the most dangerous crowd in the epidemic"", including children, elderly people over 60 years old, pregnant women, and people with diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory diseases. In view of the threat of COVID-19 virus to the composition of disadvantaged groups, it is particularly important to strengthen prevention and vaccination. If these high-risk groups cannot be vaccinated for various reasons, they should wear masks to protect themselves, maintain social distance, and abide by sanitary rules. These are methods to prevent the infection of COVID-19.  ""Unexpectedly, the local confirmed cases of Singapore have stopped falling after the unsealed."" Many media reported that the epidemic in Singapore was repeated. According to the latest plan of the country's anti -epidemic cross -departmental group, starting from the 26th of this month, Singapore has lifted most of the epidemic prevention measures. The number of social gatherings, altaries and family visits will no longer be limited. ""Washington Post"" recently reported in the Singapore outbreak: ""After the government cancels epidemic prevention restrictions and"" coexist with the virus "", local residents still insist on wearing masks. 90%of the residents are still wearing a mask.

According to the Global Times reporter, the number of new native non -symptoms in Shanghai has been less than 20,000 consecutive days. At the press conference of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control on the 27th, the relevant Shanghai municipal departments also announced that in order to further consolidate the effectiveness of Zero-Covid's work, realize the basic social Zero-COVID as soon as possible, and according to The overall idea of tackling ""is"" limited personnel, limited regions, and limited activities ""that achieve the basic ZERO-COVID district; and for areas that have not reached the basic Zero-Covid of the society, continue Comprehensive prevention and control measures such as inspection and screening, comprehensive flow investigation, cleaning and killing of the whole people, and leakage and supplementation throughout the process.  In an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 27th, Lu Hongzhou, the Dean of Shenzhen National Infectious Diseases Clinical Medicine Research Center and Dean of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, said that the number of newly added local diagnosis cases and the number of native -symptoms will continue to decline. For this reason, the ""turning point"" of the epidemic is coming, and this is also the first step in Shanghai unblocking.  Another public health expert who did not want to be named told the Global Times reporter on the 27th that on April 23, 19,657 newly added infections in Shanghai. ""After that, the number of new diagnosis and asymptomatic infected in Shanghai did not continue to rise every day, but the general decline in fluctuations may mean that the inflection point has arrived.""  However, the expert also said that the risk of rebounding in the Shanghai outbreak still exists, and recently there have been outbreaks of epidemic in China, which also reminds that it should not be taken lightly. In the future, strict implementation of epidemic control measures.  At the press conference of Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work on April 27, the relevant person in charge said that as of 24:00 on April 26, 244 patients with severe patients received treatment in designated medical institutions in designated medical institutions were 27 patients.  On April 26, there were 48 new local deaths in Shanghai, with an average age of 80.85 years. 48 patients merged with severe multi -organ basic diseases, including cerebral hemorrhage, sequelae of cerebral infarction, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, severe heart dysfunction, severe hypertension, uremia, digestive tract bleeding, and advanced pancreatic malignant tumor. One of them had been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine, and the rest did not inoculate the COVID-19 vaccine. The direct cause of death is the basic disease.  Why does the COVID-19 severe cases and the number of death cases occur in Shanghai? Lu Hongzhou introduced that after the infection of the COVID-19 virus, most infected people can recover within 5-7 days, and about 8% Infected people may experience symptoms of pneumonia. Among these 8%of the group of symptoms, if the patient has basic diseases, it belongs to the elderly, obesity, immune defects, tumors and other fragile groups. The symptoms are likely to worsen.

222,Is the price of pork? Said pig farmers,倪浩;,11,2022-04-28,79,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=DNPf6DgFiJs51Jkgu6iCfHJjLMrwREyg0N1dXaxiQ2U4bXsF9S73nqrr51vuMin_xv6M8XCS3Tgh4COabNCcEot8BNutkbioen9Z0X4VwM40W49Y-rXWIqZKi_124Wo6&uniplatform=NZKPT,"""700 million pigs!"" This is the number of pork consumed by the Chinese a year. Such a huge scale requires a stable industry guarantee. However, the Chinese pig farming industry, which has caused too much, has fallen into losses since last year, and has not yet ended. The expert team of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Ministry of Agriculture recently predicted that as factors such as the number of new piglets recovered and the cost of feed costs fell, the pig farming was expected to turn a profit into profit in the third quarter. The judgment made the entire industry seemed to see the dawn. The ups and downs of ups and downs make the pig farmers feel helpless. Some pig farmers describe the ""cut meat as a blunt knife"" in the past year. In the past few years, what have been experienced in pig farmers? Is the price of pork really rebounding now? How to avoid this kind of ups and downs? ""Global Times"" reporter interviewed a number of pig farmers and experts for this reason.  ""Selling a pig with a loss of 500 yuan""  According to the monitoring of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, as of 14:00 on the 27th, the average price of pork in the national agricultural wholesale market was 19.75 yuan/kg, an increase of 0.5%over the 26th. Earlier, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released information stating that as of mid -April this year, the price of pigs across the country has risen slightly for three consecutive weeks, and the continuous decline in the 16 weeks has eased the loss of farms and farmers.  ""Since the beginning of last year, the price of pork has fallen rapidly. Selling a pig at the bottom of the valley means that it loses 500 yuan, a very torment year."" Li Longhui, executive vice president of Green Giant Giant Giant Green Giant Green Giant, Dali Nong ""The money made by a pig earlier to make up for the loss of the two pigs now, everyone has been eating old books this year."" Li Longhui said that it is almost eaten now. The industry is very false.  However, as the group company, Daibei has the advantage of diversified layout. Large domestic enterprises are basically the industrial chain layout, and the upstream and downstream are opened, so the ability to resist the risk of fighting is relatively strong.  ""What really sad is that we have thousands of heads and no upstream and downstream companies. There are no feed in the upstream, and there is no processing downstream. We are pressured on both ends."" Manager Wang, the relevant person in charge of a pig farm in Sichuan told the Global Times told the Global Times. The reporter said, ""The ups and downs of the price, just like a blunt knife cut the meat, is uncomfortable. If the price of pork has been below 5-6 yuan, it can be carried in 3 months and 5 months. Holding hope, you can only go out. Either sell the farm, or you can turn around. ""  Data show that pig farming companies generally encountered Waterloo last year. The latest disclosure of Zhengbang Technology's 2021 annual performance forecast shows that it is expected to belong to the net profit loss of shareholders of listed companies from 18.2 billion yuan to 19.7 billion yuan, and the losses are ranked first in live pig breeding enterprises. In addition, Wen's shares and new hope for pig farming companies are also poor, and both revenue and net profit have both declined.  The price is up in the second half of the year?  Since 2002, the Chinese pig breeding industry has gone through five rounds of ""pig cycles"" (as shown above), and each round of cycles lasted about 3-4 years. However, the ""pig cycle"" from 2018 to the present is like a roller coaster, which makes this cycle very different from the past. In 2019, affected by the African swine fever and the COVID-19 epidemic, domestic pig prices rose rapidly. Until the Spring Festival in 2021, meat prices ushered in the final ""highlight time"", with a price of more than 36 yuan per kilogram.  As soon as the Spring Festival in February 2021, demand declined, the price of pigs fell for 5 consecutive months. In June, the country fell below the cost price, and the average price of pigs fell to 5 yuan per catty. The entire industry was in depth of losses and wandered until late March this year.  In fact, the turning point of the ""pig cycle"" of the ""pig cycle"" appeared in the second half of 2020. After the cycle of pig prices rising in 2019 and 2020, pig prices that should be down in the second half of 2020 have risen abnormally, and the original vigilance of the entire industry was quickly transformed into an optimistic emotion.  ""From August to September each year, we have to do the next year's business plan. In 2020, we expect that pig prices will decline in the second half of the year, but the fact is that the price of pigs not only drops up and rushes up. All disrupted. We are also doubting whether our judgment is wrong. ""Li Longhui told reporters.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Ministry of Agriculture and Rural at the time prompted the coming cycle of the entire industry. But the prompt did not attach enough attention in the industry. As a result, before the price of pigs fell rapidly in early 2021, the pig breeding industry continued to expand production, and the cost of feed for overlay corn and soybean meal was increased significantly, and the industry's operations and production were all disrupted. As the price of pig prices whispered, the entire industry quickly fell into losses.  However, Wang Zuli, an associate researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the chief expert of the pig industry monitoring and early warning of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, believed that in an interview with the reporter of the Global Times that this state is about to end. ""Turn losses in the second half of the year, I think the problem is not big,"" he told reporters that the market supply will be relatively reduced, and the market demand will turn well, so the price of pork will appear in the second half of the year.  ""The last pig cycle ended in June 2018, and it has been almost 4 years until now. In a cycle in 4 years, I think this round is coming soon, and the price of pigs should go up."" Li Longhui told the Global Times reporter, "" I personally believe that the latest judgment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs will usher in a turn of losses in the second half of the year. ""  Epidemic factors and lessons  Wang Zili told the reporter of the Global Times that in fact, the downward stage of this round of pig cycle is not longer than usual, but the price has fallen deeply, because the price has risen crazy enough before. If you have a high profit in the early days, you may experience a round of depth loss. ""  Regarding the arrival of the industry in the second half of the year, Li Longhui and Manager Wang both regarded the epidemic as an important decisive factor. Li Longhui said, ""The epidemic will suppress market demand. If everyone eats much, the price will not rise.""  After a significant fluctuations in the price of pork, the pig farming industry also learned from it. Li Longhui told reporters, ""In the second half of 2020, everyone ignored the tips from the competent authority. After this year's decline, everyone began to restore rationality."" He said that he hoped that the entire industry could learn lessons, scientifically formulate operation plans, respect the laws of the market, and cut off the peaks of the industry to fill the bottom of the valley, so that the entire industry was smoother and rational, rather than rising, unliked, great grief.",Pork prices; Global Times; pig farmer; pig cycle;

Quickly take relevant measures to curb the sporadic epidemic and avoid economic and social dilemma similar to Shanghai experience.  At the occasion of the large-scale COVID-19 virus nucleic acid test at Hangzhou near Shanghai, the capital Beijing is trying to block the epidemic. Qinhuangdao, the Gangkou City, and Yiwu, known for the production of Christmas decorations, have also entered the city or local sealing.  After being closed for a month, the current trend of Shanghai's epidemic seemed to be stabilizing. On Wednesday, the number of local infections fell for the fifth day in a row to the lowest in 3 weeks. Beijing only reported dozens of infections yesterday, which shows that a large -scale detection has not found a wider range of epidemic conditions.  Hangzhou is the headquarters of e -commerce giant Alibaba. Right now, the company's office is still running normally, but employees must confirm their health every day.  The Associated Press on April 27th, the original title: With the ""stocking"" of Beijing residents, the new test results will determine that Shanghai's reopening situation will be closely concerned about whether the local residents are concerned about the local seal control. Based on the results of nucleic acid test results in the next few days, which communities can start to start safely and re -open.  After a clustering case was found last week, Beijing was conducting large -scale nucleic acid tests on millions of residents. In the past few days, citizens who felt nervous began to hoard food and living materials. In this regard, Beijing officials soon promised that they would ensure that the commercial super supply was sufficient, and it was monitoring the newly developed wholesale markets with most sources of supply to the city with real -time monitoring. As of now, Beijing officials have only adopted control measures to discover a specific area of someone infected with the COVID-19 virus.

The Associated Press reporter noticed that the traditional ""Golden Week"" has not completely disappeared. Data from online travel websites such as Ctrip show that about half of this year's ""May 1"" order is traveling in the province. The city is the most popular, and the COVID-19 epidemic Wuhan, the first large-scale city, has now become a popular tourist destination.

However, Reuters said that it is not yet possible to determine whether Shanghai has appeared ""inflection points"" in the anti -epidemic situation. After two consecutive days of no social infection cases, there are new cases other than closed -loop areas in Shanghai, showing that the epidemic is repeated.  Yang Zhanqiu, a professor at the Institute of Basic Medicine of Wuhan University of Medicine, told the reporter of the Global Times on the 4th that on the 3rd, Shanghai's newly added local positive infection cases dropped to less than 5,000 cases on the 3rd, which showed that the static management measures adopted in Shanghai played a role.

Cases, 5 of them are asymptomatic, because during the holidays, some subway stations have a relatively small impact on urban life. Beijing's control of the epidemic seems to be ""too strict.""  In this regard, Yang Zhanqiu told the Global Times reporter that restricting the bus and subway lines is a way to implement static management on the serious area of the epidemic, minimizing and restricting personnel flow, and virus transmission. Yang Zhanqiu said that the situation of an increasing local diagnosis of 50 or 60 daily diagnosis shows that the current Beijing epidemic is still in an epidemic. During this period, it is required to be quickly discovered and controlled quickly. On May 4th, the highest temperature in Beijing reached 34 degrees Celsius. Yang Zhanqiu said that whether it is Delta or Omikon, ""the virus is not conducive to survival in high temperatures, and the survival time is short.""  ""Calm in Beijing""  This quiet and restrained ""May Day"" allows domestic and overseas media to have the opportunity to observe China's ""zero tolerance"" resistance strategy. ""A small part of the 25 million population in Shanghai has been allowed to go out for walks and shopping on Tuesday after more than a month of closed control; Beijing capital Beijing has launched large -scale nucleic acid testing and students' suspension, hoping to stop dozens of newly added every day a day a day The epidemic of the case further outbreak, ""said on the 4th.

Beijing has been isolated from some communities, but so far, it has not been adopted to take control measures in the city as Shanghai, and reports have shown ""the calmness of Beijing"". The British ""Guardian"" reported on the 4th that in order to control the epidemic, Beijing has re -opened a large -scale isolation center located in Xiaotangshan, which marks the efforts of the Chinese capital to manage cases without entering the city.  ""More and more Chinese cities have implemented normalized testing."" Hong Kong's ""South China Morning Post"" stated on the 4th that the Dalian Municipal Government announced that starting from May 5, citizens in the city conducted normalized nucleic acid testing every week. Zhengzhou City, Henan also stated that it will conduct three rounds of testing in the city center until Friday. Prior to this, similar measures were taken by the capital Beijing, Southern Manufacturing and Science and Technology Center, and Hangzhou in the eastern city. According to data from the National Health and Health Commission, as of mid-April, there were about 1,3100 COVID-19 virus detection agencies in China, with a daily detection capacity of 51.65 million samples.  Wang Guangfa, director of the Department of Respiratory Department of Peking University First Hospital, told the Global Times reporter on the 4th that the ""time and space is very special"" in Beijing's epidemic: In time, it is precisely during the ""May 1st"" holiday period, travel and party may be possible There will be more; in terms of space, an epidemic has also experienced an epidemic in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has enough attention to the outbreak of this epidemic. He said that the recent outbreak of the epidemic reminds us that we should take measures decisively when the epidemic appears to control the epidemic and return to normal life as soon as possible.  Temasek: The economy will rebound in the second half of the year  The Spanish ""National News"" said on the 3rd that China is the only large economy in today's strategy to maintain a ""zero tolerance"" strategy. Thanks to this strategy, China has become the first country in the world to report the first wave of epidemic and the economy has begun to recover. Essence Now, the new cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai have begun to decline, and Li Keqiang, Prime Minister of the State Council of China, asked officials to ""enhance the sense of urgency"" and implement various stimulus measures. The Chinese government has approved measures to accelerate the speed of road freight, and the People's Bank of China has reduced the bank's reserve ratio. The Chinese government is also sending positive signals to clearly believe that they can achieve ambitious growth goals while controlling the epidemic. The meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 29th settled the rudder for the current economic work, emphasizing that it is pointed out that ""strive to achieve the goal of the annual economic and social development expectations and maintain economic operation in a reasonable range.""  Bloomberg News in the United States said on the 4th that Singapore Temasek is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year. Luo Xide, chief investment strategist of Temasek, said that with the launch of the Chinese government's stimulus measures, the economy will rebound in the second half of the year, and the economy in the United States and Europe will shrink. He said that after the Chinese government's policies are becoming more clear in the coming months, some Chinese technology companies will have very attractive investment opportunities.  Hong Kong's ""Ming Pao"" said on the 4th that in the global anti-epidemic territory, as far as the epidemic prevention policy is concerned, China is a ""independent show"". At this moment, ""coexistence"" is still not applicable to mainland China. COVID's ""general policy is necessary, and China cannot afford so many people's life security.  The Associated Press said on the 4th that when Beijingers' ""May 1st"" travel, they often consciously avoid high -risk areas, so as not to be tracked on mobile phones to record data, which may cause trouble to enter other public areas in the future.  Recently, a survey published in the magazine published in the British ""Liuye Knife · Public Health"" shows that in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, the people who adopt the ""zero tolerance"" epidemic strategy country ""Small"", and people who implement ""coexiste"" with viruses are more likely to ""increase psychological distress, reduce quality of life, and be dissatisfied with government management.""

During the ""May 1st"" holiday, many places across the country issued a new policy for preventing and controlling the epidemic in the vacation after the holidays. Primary and secondary school kindergartens in some areas have also made decisions to delay returning to school or even suspended classes. Experts said in an interview with the Global Times reporter that the new policies adopted in many places are not essentially different. The principles are to control the source of infection, cut off the transmission pathway, and protect the susceptible people.  Primary and secondary schools in many places are suspended from school  From 0:00 on the 3rd to 24:00, 103 newly -asymptomatic infections were added in the Danuquan District of Yingkou City, Liaoning Province, all of which were found in the closed management (centralized isolation place) of Liaoning Agricultural Vocational and Technical College. According to reports, the school added 177 asymptomatic infections in 3 days, and had been closed for more than 40 days. According to the ""Dandong Release"" WeChat public account on the 4th, recently, the Fifth Middle School of Dandong City also occurred in the COVID-19 epidemic. Related measures have been introduced in many places to delay the start time of education institutions, and even stop classes into online teaching.  At the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention and Control Conference on May 3, Li Yi, deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Education Work Committee and spokesman for the Municipal Education Commission, said that Beijing primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and secondary vocational schools The suspension of the school for a week, the specific return time is determined after comprehensive research and judgment of the city's epidemic situation. For the on -site examination on the third day of sports entrance examinations that are about to be conducted in May, Beijing will adhere to the student -oriented, in accordance with the principle of health first, safety organization, fairness and fair Gathering; reasonably adjust the test organization method, or adopt a unified concentration organizational method, or organize testing in the school where the candidates are located, to maximize the number of candidates and reduce risks.  According to the Global Times reporter, due to the demand for the prevention and control of the epidemic, corresponding measures have been introduced in many places across the country. Earlier, Shanghai has adjusted all primary and secondary schools in the city to online teaching from March 13. On May 3, the schools, child care institutions, and off -campus training institutions in the main urban area of Zhengzhou City suspended school and started online teaching. The city's clustering activities are suspended. On the same day, the Education Bureau of Fenghua District of Ningbo also issued a notice that some schools (kindergartens) of Fenghua District (kindergarten) in Fenghua District, Ningbo will be suspended. Specify all offline courses, carry out online teaching activities, and notify the restoration time of offline teaching.  An interview with the Global Times reporter on the 4th that an unknown immunist said on the 4th that from the perspective of the epidemic prevention and control measures adopted throughout the country, there was no difference in essence, and the difference was only the degree of execution.  Wang Guangfa, director of the Department of Respiratory Department of Peking University's First Hospital, told the Global Times reporter on the 4th that the measures taken by Beijing and other places are essentially no difference. They are to control the source of infection, cut off the channels of communication, and protect the susceptible people.  New Deal of Returning to Epidemic Prevention Proficiency  In addition to issuing many places to postpone the policy of delaying the return of primary and secondary schools, how to return to work after working in the group festival is also a topic that has attracted much attention.  The Beijing Municipal Government News Office announced on May 4th that due to the need to prevent and control the epidemic, since May 4, 2022, more than 40 subway stations in Beijing take closed measures to stop entering and exiting the station. Measures and other measures. At the press conference of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control on May 4th, Xu Hejian, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government, introduced that in order to realize the dynamics of society as soon as possible, Beijing will temporarily continue the ""May Day"" holiday social defense. In control, the catering operation unit continues to suspend the food service. The units in the area of Chaoyang and the regional regions of public transportation operations will be implemented at home from May 5th. Those who must go to the job must be adopted as much as possible to reduce the internal gathering of the unit to achieve two points and one line of the unit family.  During the ""May 1st"" period, the ""May 1st"" returning epidemic prevention and control policy was also introduced in many places in the country. According to reports, Tianjin will continue to implement the test negative certification test of kernel acid testing of kernel acid testing 48 hours before returning to Jinjin and within 24 hours after the arrival. The work unit urged the staff to implement the ""point -to -point"" closed -loop office within 7 days of Dinjun. It is strictly forbidden to dinner and gathers in public places, and implement nucleic acid testing on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th after the voucher. Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province stipulates that all personnel from stone and stone must hold a 48 -hour kernel acid test negative certificate. Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, stipulates that the province's foreign Hangjun has a green code and has 48 hours of kernel acid negative proof. Wuhan in Hubei stipulates that those who come and return to Han in other provinces must still provide a 48 -hour nucleic acid detection negative certificate and implement the ""three days and two inspections"", otherwise they will be ""gray code"". Chongqing City stipulates that those who return to the city from foreign and Chongqing must hold 48 hours of kernel acid test negative proof and the ""health code"" green code. After arriving in Chongqing, report to the community and fill in the ""community QR code"". Do 1 nucleic acid detection. It must be emphasized that the 3 -day test includes the results of 24 -hour nucleic acid test results.  After the long holiday, it may also involve the problem of public use in public toilets. On May 3rd, some media learned from the Beijing Urban Management Committee that Beijing will increase the frequency of disinfection of public toilets, and the public toilets around intensive places around railway stations, markets and other people will increase the disinfection. Sterilizer, not two or more (including) or more at the same time.  Why does Beijing increase the frequency of nucleic acid screening  From May 3rd to 5th, Beijing will continue to carry out three-wheel regional nucleic acid screening for 12 regions. Multi -round nucleic acid screening was also carried out before. What kind of prevention and control effect does such high -frequency nucleic acid detection do you want to achieve?  The above-mentioned unnamed immunologists said that Beijing still found some distribution cases outside the control of the crowd, and the frequency of increasing nucleic acid detection was mainly to realize the social Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  Wang Guangfa also believes that the frequency of increasing nucleic acid detection in 12 districts in Beijing shows that the epidemic situation in these areas cannot be reassuring. ""Multi -wheeled nucleic acid testing again will help discover incubation cases earlier. This decision is based on epidemics. The survey is not blind. Nucleic acid testing of large -scale people has been proven to be an effective means of epidemic prevention and control in previous rounds of epidemic.  At the press conference of the Beijing New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Epidemic Prevention and Control Work on May 4th, Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work group deputy team leader, deputy director of the Municipal Health and Health Committee, and spokesman According to Li Ang, according to the deployment of the leading group of the municipal epidemic prevention and control work, the city has continuously carried out three -wheeled regional nucleic acid screening on May 3, 4, and 5 on May 3, 4, and 5. In the first round of tests carried out on May 3, a total of 9266 sampling points were set up, 22,000 sample tables were set up, and 44,000 sampling personnel were used. At 8 o'clock on the 4th, the test has been completed, and a total of 3 tubes ""ten mixes"" are positive, which are located in Chaoyang District, Fengtai District, and Miyun District.  In addition, at the press conference, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Disease Prevention and Control Center and a member of the National New Coronary Virus Pneumonia Expert Group, said that from April 22 to May 4th, 505 COVID-19 virus was reported The infected person involves 15 districts in Beijing.

Although the daily increase has reached 40- 50 cases, but the overall size is not very large, the public should have confidence in preventing and controlling the epidemic in Beijing.

The article states that one of 12 people under the age of 18 has lost the guardian because of the epidemic; in every public school in the United States, two children have lost a guardian due to the epidemic. The US media commented that even if this country can face the slaughter of the COVID-19 virus in two years, the degree of loss is still shocking and difficult to accept.  From the perspective of data distribution, ethnic minorities from low -income and non -white families account for 65%of the ""orphan"" — each white American child becomes an orphan, and there are 1.8 Spanish American children, 2.4 Famous African -American children and 4.5 Indian aborigines and Alaska aboriginal children have experienced the same encounters. Nearly half of the COVID-19 orphans are concentrated in 6 states of California, Texas, New York State, Florida, Arizona, and Georgia, which coincide with the most poor states in the United States.  This is a silent sorrow of the American poverty intergenerational inheritance and social inequality spiral. Among the 200,000 new orphans, most of them have been at the bottom of the American society since birth, and there are few opportunities to change destiny. The epidemic also took their parents, causing their lives to fall into a darker and helpless dilemma -dropping out of school, drug abuse, and violence is likely to accompany them throughout their lives. As the global co-chair of the Children's Evaluation Team, the co-chair of the children's assessment team, Susan Hillis said: ""It is not something to recover in two weeks later.""  However, the social attention caused by ordinary lives in the United States in the epidemic is getting lower and lower, because Washington has already shifted more attention to Wall Street data, and even on the political game of foreign ground. Driven by the eagerness to declare the COVID-19 epidemic ""ended"", the groups of the United States who were trapped in the pain of epidemic were ""forgotten"" intentionally or unintentionally.  This seems to be ""taken for granted"" under the United States system: the orphans have no political spokesperson, no lobbying capital, and no votes in their hands. Who would expect the members of the Congress Mountain to help them go to call for them? But should it be abandoned without capital and votes?  Since the COVID-19 epidemic, the US federal government has issued trillions of dollars of bailout gold. The top wealth of the top wealth even increased by 50%during the epidemic. provide help. Although the US President Biden has released an unknown memo, it is generally believed that ""there is actually no plan or commitment."" American sociologist Mills pointed out in ""Elite of Power"": ""The United States is the 'democracy' ruled by a few people with wealth and power, which is actually a fantasy of the public!""  Today, the number of deaths in the United States has approached 1 million due to the COVID-19 epidemic, which means that it has repeated 1 million times due to the unexpected life of other human tragedies.

However, for countless families, those cold numbers not only mean losing their loved ones, but also also. It may mean the collapse of life.  Protecting the weak and the strong to enjoy the same rights, this is an important measure of human society to get rid of brutal and enter the era of civilization. When the disaster is coming, is it necessary to collect the weak people together to help each other, or not hesitate to kick them out of the ship to ""reduce the burden"" to test the moral bottom line of a country's ruling elite.

On the 5th, Taiwan ’s newly -added diagnosis exceeded 30,000 people, with 30,106 cases, including 30035 local cases and 71 cases input, and 5 newly died. However, some experts on the island said that the accuracy rate of self -use nucleic acid fast screening agents may not reach as high as the Taiwan authorities said, and the number of real cases may be greater.  According to the Taiwan United News Network reported on the 5th, Zhuang Renxiang, a spokesman for the Taiwan ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"", predicts that by May 11, the number of diagnosis of 75,244 in a single day will reach 7,524, and the proportion of severe illnesses in the future may increase. Chen Shizhong, ""Epidemic Prevention Commander"", said that it is estimated that in the future, it is estimated that the minimum of 40,000 cases in the future will be 40,000, with 150,000 folds and a maximum of 200,000 per day.  The surge in diagnosis of numbers has made the relevant resources on the island stretched out. Earlier, when the people on the island were isolated at home, they needed to go to the hospital or test institution before they were included in the diagnosis data. In order to avoid sensitive people such as home isolations to take public transportation, the ""Epidemic Prevention Command Center"" announced on the 5th that it will relax the positive definition of such people from the 12th -the use of fast screening tests and confirmation of medical staff is the confirmation.  However, Li Jianzhang, a clinical associate professor at the Department of Emergency Medicine of the National Taiwan University Hospital and a Ph.D. in Harvard University of Pharmaceutical Popularity, has questioned the accuracy of the fast screen reagents, including the Roche and Yabei home fast screen reagents that people can buy on the island. According to the data released by the Taiwan ""Food and Drug Administration"", the sensitivity of Roche's fast screen is 86.4%, and the A -e -ravage sieve test agent is 98.1%. However, Li Jianzhang explained that there is generally a certain gap between experimental data and clinical data. Recently, large -scale research statistics show that the sensitivity of fast screening clinical trials has dropped to between 40%to 70%. And the average canbi fast screening agent that the general public can buy is lower, only 71.8%. In other words, about 30%of the probability will show ""false negatives"", that is, of every 10 infected patients, 3 people or even 6 people will miss the use of fast screening tests. Most of these omitted patients are infectious. of.  ""Lianhe Daily"" published an editorial on the 5th that Chen Shizhong estimated on April 12 that the diagnosis of the island may exceed a thousand cases at the end of April; but by the end of April, the actual number of Taiwan was 15,000, and the epidemic was far beyond its imagination. After a few days in May, the number of daily infections had 30,000, which was completely unexpected. The article warns that when Chen Shizhong is still costing reagent and artificial screening costs, Chen Shizhong is still limiting which patients can obtain medication.

This number has made the United States the country with the largest number of people in the world due to COVID-19. At the same time, experts predict that under the current comprehensive open policy of the United States, the number of COVID-19 deaths and the number of residents will show a significant upward trend in the next few weeks.  According to the US Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) on the 4th, the 1 million per million died in the 27 months of the US outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, and more than half of the number of deaths in the U.S. government came to power. Although Biden said at the beginning of his office, he said that he would increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate and set up the goal of ""70 % of the people who vaccinated 70 % of the people before the Independence Day (July 4)"", but eventually failed to achieve it Essence According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from April to December 2021, more than 80 % of the COVID-19 death cases were not vaccinated. In addition, the risk of those who did not vaccine in the United States died of COVID-19, which was 20 times higher than the vaccine.  Although the number of new death cases in the United States has declined some time ago, the average daily daily died of COVID-19. At present, most states and cities in the United States have canceled forced mask policies and crowd gathering ban. Employees are required to return to the office to work, and the school has restored offline lectures. Since the end of last month, the number of hospitalizations caused by COVID-19 in the United States has been slowly increasing. Last week, the number of hospitalizations increased by 20%, and the number of emergency consultations increased by 18%. The latest CDC prediction model shows that in the next 4 weeks, the number of COVID-19 admission and COVID-19 related deaths in the United States will rise for the first time in several months. In the next two weeks, about 5,000 people in the United States will die in COVID-19.  At present, the number of new COVID-19 in the United States has reached the highest point in the past two months. According to CDC data, the number of new cases in a single day exceeded 60,000, which increased by 27%last week. The COVID-19 infection rate in the northeast of the country has increased by 64.8%in the past two weeks. Some American media said that since the summer of 2021, dozens of states in the country have gradually closed public testing places, and more people now conduct COVID-19 self-test at home. Most Americans have not reported the results of the government's test. Therefore, experts believe that the total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States may be seriously underestimated.  After multiple rounds of anti -vaccine and anti -mandatory masks, the American society was numb to the epidemic prevention. Robert Murphy, Executive Director of Harvey Global Health Research Institute of Fanberg Medical College of Northwestern University in the United States, said, ""We know the vaccine is effective, the mask is effective, and the social distance is effective. No. ""  Health experts said that under the influence of various factors, such as relaxing the requirements of wearing masks and other COVID-19 epidemic restrictions, as well as the new subtype of Omikon strain with high contagious Omiko, the United States may usher in a new round of COVID -19 epidemic. At present, many countries have found COVID-19 virus reorganization strains, which has further increased the difficulty of preventing and controlling the epidemic. It is estimated that the infectivity of the new subtype strain is 30%to 80%higher than the contagious substrate of the original Omikon. In addition, Israeli researchers reported that when the COVID-19 mutant strain Omikon accelerated the spread, Delta's strains were still secretly spread.

Beijing: As soon as possible, Zero-Covid  At the press conference of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work on May 8, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the National New Coronary Virus Pneumonic Pneumonia At 15:00 on the 8th, there were 39 new local COVID-19 virus infections, all of which were controller. They were currently transferred to a designated hospital isolation and treatment. Related risk points and personnel have been in place.  Xu Hejian, deputy minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, said that the current COVID-19 cases of COVID-19 are still operating at a high level, and there are still scattered social cases. It is necessary to resolutely implement the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy, and strictly implement the measures to prevent control and control of the epidemic, and realize the social Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  Regarding the epidemic prevention and control strategy adopted by Beijing, Wang Guangfa, director of the Department of Respiratory Department of Peking University First Hospital, said in an interview with a reporter from the Global Times on the 8th that there are still dozens of new diagnosis and asymptomatic infection cases in Beijing. There are not many cases, because Beijing now adopts a positive prevention and control strategy.  ""There is a saying that the pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strains may be low, which may be like this for young people. Less. If you take any attitude of the epidemic, the number of cases will increase significantly. When the infectious disease is spread in society, the proportion of infection of fragile people such as the elderly and the basic diseases will increase Increased. Therefore, we still have to adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid 'general policy, combined with precise prevention and control, insist on early discovery, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment. Until today, this is still very necessary and effective."" Wang Guangfa said.  What is the trend of this round of epidemic in Beijing in the future? Wang Guangfa believes that it mainly depends on three factors. First of all, we must consider the impact of the overflow effects in other regions of the country. According to the National Health and Health Commission, at 0-24 on May 7, in addition to Beijing and Shanghai, more than ten provinces and cities including Henan, Liaoning, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Jilin in the country have new diagnosis and no diagnosis and no diagnosis and no. The cases of symptoms infected, including 85, 76 cases, and 60 cases of newly added infections in Liaoning, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces.  In addition, Wang Guangfa believes that the number of existing infections is critical. And confirming whether there are still unlimited cases, nucleic acid detection is a very effective means. The population and frequency of the nanotrophic acid testing of nucleic acid testing are dynamically adjusted according to the epidemic. When the epidemic is severe, the global nucleic acid test must be carried out. Effect. Wang Guangfa also believes that the degree of epidemic prevention and control measures adopted in Beijing in the early stage will also affect the future trend of the epidemic.  Chaoyang District announced the management and control measures  The Beijing Municipal Conference reported on the 8th that a total of 15.52 million people were screened on May 7th, all of which completed the test, and a total of 5 pipes were sieved. Since April 25, the city has carried out 8 rounds of regional nucleic acid screening, and a total of 60 pipes have been sieved, which has played an important role in blocking epidemic dissemination and realizing social dynamics Zero-Covid as soon as possible. Beijing Shunyi District will continue to carry out three-wheel regional nucleic acid screening on May 8th to 10th.  At the press conference on May 8th, Yang Beibei, deputy head of the People's Government of Chaoyang District, introduced that there have been sporadic emitting cases in the society in the past few days. Some management and control staff did not consciously implement the isolation of home home. In addition, the virus is hidden and difficult to find. In order to realize the social ZERO-COVID as soon as possible, after comprehensive evaluation, the Chaoyang District has further relegated and controlled, including: First, rearing control measures. The seal -controlled area is closed, the house is not exit, and the service came to the door. The temporary management and control zone in the region shall be managed in accordance with the management and control zone. Except for nucleic acids, the management and control areas cannot be implemented. The behavior of failing to implement home isolation and other epidemic prevention will be dealt with seriously. The second is that the entire district continues to strictly implement home office. All party and government agencies, enterprises and institutions in the region, all personnel who live and work in the sun, personnel who live in the sun and work in the external areas, all personnel who work in the Chaoyang and living in the outside area are strictly implemented at home office. All enterprises that have nothing to do with people's livelihood protection in the area have been suspended, and they will further increase supervision and inspection. Those who have not been strictly implemented as required and dealt with seriously. Yang Beibei reminds everyone not to organize family gatherings to avoid gathering risks. At the same time, it is advocated that everyone must not be in the sun.

Shanghai will continue to conduct a ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening based on the three districts, in which the sealing control area is performed once a day; the control area adopts a weekly ""3 -day nucleic acid+4 -day antigen"" combination screening method; the prevention area is adopted The ""1 nucleic acid+6 antigen"" combination screening method is performed every week, and the negative proof of the ""1 nuclear acid"" combination screening method is detected by 48 hours. For urban service guarantee personnel such as distribution delivery, volunteers, etc., ""1 nucleic acid+2 antigen detection"" is carried out every day (2 test intervals of 2 tests). At the press conference, Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of Health and Health, introduced that in order to ensure that ""not leaks one household and one person does not fall"", Shanghai will carry out ""sweeping the street, sweeping the building, knocking on the door"" to strengthen the enterprises, construction sites, shops along the street, and shops along the streets. Investigation of apartment buildings, commercial buildings, hotels, and social mobile personnel.  Regarding the trend of the Shanghai epidemic, several experts were interviewed by the Global Times reporter on the 8th that the latest data released positive signals.

It can be seen that this round of Shanghai epidemic has improved. It is expected that this wave of epidemic should be suppressed in about two weeks.  However, another unnamed public immunologist said that this round of epidemic in Shanghai is different from other places. The decline in the number of new infections is stepped, showing a step-by-step decline. Maybe you need to observe for a while. The expert also stated that because the area of Shanghai is relatively large, it is also worth thinking about how to relax the control in the next step. Among them, it is necessary to prevent the rebound of the epidemic. As a result, some citizens have a decline in immunity.

However, we have accumulated a lot of experience in the detection of large -scale nucleic acids, and the detection efficiency has also improved significantly. At the same time, the availability of Beijing nucleic acid detection has also been greatly enhanced. Citizens can detect without the streets or even the community, which is very convenient.  While detecting the infected persons in a timely manner through large -scale nucleic acid testing, Beijing's commercial neighborhoods, parks and other public places also actively adopted measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission. On the 10th, Sanlitun issued a notice and business arrangements for epidemic prevention and business arrangements. According to the requirements of the Chaoyang District Government to further strengthen the prevention and control measures of the epidemic, all the merchants, commercial complexes except catering (forbidden halls), and commercial life security formats and other people's livelihood security formats all all the formats and other people's livelihood security formats. Suspend business. On the day of the day, many parks including Chaoyang Park announced that it will be closed from the park from now on, and the opening time will be notified separately.  At present, Shanghai is still in a critical period of epidemic prevention and control. According to Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission, reported on the 10th, 234 new COVID-19 local confirmed cases and 2780 cases of infected infected were added on the 9th. Of the 234 cases of confirmation of the soil, 78 cases were found in the closed -loop isolation control, and 156 cases were asymptomatic infected from the confirmed case; 2780 cases of non -symptoms of the soil were found in the closed -loop isolation control. Discovered during the screening of risk personnel.  Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the 10th that most of the more than 2,000 newly added infected people on the 9th were found in isolation and control. From the regional distribution More than 90%of them are from central urban areas and suburbs. These areas are often old communities, old -fashioned Lane, and urban and rural areas, including areas with concentrated areas in the villages in the city.  Recently, Shanghai is carrying out environmental cleaning and disinfecting operations. Among them, the disinfection of households has aroused great attention from citizens. On the evening of the 9th, it was rumored to be forced to disinfect the households in Xichengli, Huaihai Middle Road, Huangpu District, Shanghai, which aroused concern for residents. Jin Chen, deputy team leader of the special class of environmental improvement and disinfecting work in Shanghai, and deputy director of the Municipal Housing and Urban -Rural Development Management Committee, responded on the 10th that the development of household disinfection is an important part of the entire epidemic prevention and control. According to the requirements, disinfection work should be carried out for places where the positive infected people live and live, and the disease control department has formulated a series of disinfection specifications and evaluation specifications. According to Kim Chen, the disinfection of households is aimed at the family -positive infected families. But there is an exception that for the combination of kitchen and bathrooms in the old communities. If the positive infected kitchen and toilet with neighboring surrounding residents, it is also necessary to carry out endless disinfection for residents who share the kitchen and bathroom.  On the same day, Sun Xiaodong responded to the saying that ""one person is positive, the entire transfer"" stated that the judgment of confidentiality and sub -connection is the requirements of epidemiological investigative professionals in accordance with the requirements of the state and the city. The group's suggestions and the results of epidemiological investigation and the information of big data investigation are made to make a comprehensive judgment.  Experts emphasize that specific judgments need to be made based on the results of on -site surveys and risk assessment, and must not be simplified or cut.  According to Shanghai Media reported on the 10th, since 13:00 on the day, Shanghai Metro Line 6 and Line 16 stopped operating services across the line. So far, all line stations in the Shanghai Rail Transit Network have stopped operation. It is reported that this is the first time that the Shanghai Metro was completed on the entire network.  According to reports, from the 10th, Guangzhou Airport, Railway, Highway Passenger Transport and other foreign transportation methods have canceled 48 -hour nucleic acid negative proof of 48 -hour nucleic acid negatives.

Puxin Pavilion is located in the bell area where the traditional and modern elements of Seoul City are used. Because of the Korean dynasty as a clock tower, it is also called ""Zhongge"". Before the COVID-19 epidemic occurred, the Puxin Pavilion had a permanent bell ceremony. The gatekeeper in the military uniform wearing the Korean dynasty was worshiped the bell ceremony of that era. In addition to the bell -knocking ceremony of the president's inauguration ceremony, the largest celebration of Puxin Pavilion was the New Year's bell. Many Korean people believe that the bells of Puxin Pavilion greeted them to give them courage and strength to welcome the new year.  The bell -to -be -clock ritual trust blessing  The Zhongge, which has hundreds of years of history, is quietly located between the towering buildings, and the near -neighboring ""Gentleman's Wannian, Jieer Jingfu"" Jingfu Palace, and the opticalization of the meaning of ""light, enlighten the Quartet"" Compared with Caoxi Temple, one of the most representative temples in South Korea and South Korea, the ancient building of Puxin Pavilion may not be deeply impressed by tourists, but its influence is not small. In addition to the president's inauguration ceremony, the bell knocking ceremony, and the clock belling ceremony, the Puxin Pavilion will also knock on the bell on March 1st, and the August 15th Light Rehabilitation Festival. In addition, every time the Korean college entrance examination enters the 100 -day countdown, many students of the students participate in the ""Bell Clock Campaign of Praying for the College Entrance Examination Gold List"" held in Puxin Pavilion, praying for their children.  The best season for Puxinge's tourism is April, May, and October. The temperature is suitable, the weather is fine, and the Puxin Pavilion is particularly beautiful against the clear blue sky. Before the epidemic, at the clock ceremony of Puxin Pavilion's Korean dynasty, tourists could wear Hanbok to experience touch Puxin Pavilion and listen to the bells. Among the participants of the Puxin Pavilion's clock ceremony, a bell can be selected. There have been Korean bloggers who have written about how to listen to the bells of Puxin Pavilion: Starting from the first loud noise, you need to listen to the spreading sound waves with your heart, and slowly feel the emotions of each disappearing Yu. Take a picture in front of Puxin Pavilion and take a walk on the bank of the nearby Qingxi Sichuan.  Puxinge Witness History  According to the introduction of the National Central Museum of Korea, Puxin Pavilion's Zhong is 3.18 meters high, with a caliber of 2.28 meters, weighing 19.66 tons. It belongs to a large clock and is a typical clock in the early period of the Korean dynasty. The side of the bell is left with a vague bodhisattva. The names and official titles of the people who are engraved with the casting age and participating in the cast are engraved. In 1895, after hanging the plaque of Puxin Pavilion in the bell tower, this bell was also called ""Puxin Ge Gong"" and was designated as a Korean national treasure. Until 1985, the Puxin Pavilion bell was used for the bell -knocking event on New Year's Eve every year. In order to protect the cultural heritage, the newly cast bell after 1986, the old Puxin Pavilion bell was displayed in the Korean National Central Museum.  Puxun Pavilion is an iconic building in the center of Seoul, which has important historical significance. Many incidents in modern history occurred in Puxin Pavilion. When Japan surrendered in 1945, the citizens of Seoul (now Seoul) gathered Puxin Pavilion to celebrate the liberation.  In the Korean drama ""Mr. Sunshine"", Puxin Pavilion has a high rate of appearance. The play is based on the chaos of the North Korean dynasty. Cui Yizhen (Li Bingxian) and everyone's girlfriend Gao Aixin (Jindai Pei) who returned to North Korea as a slave and returned to North Korea as a slave and later returned to North Korea. The Puxin Pavilion in the play is a single -story building with a fence. That's because the bell tower was burned and rebuilt several times. The Puxin Pavilion that everyone saw today is a double -story building without fence.  Participate in the New Year's bell in the New Year  The biggest celebration of Puxin Pavilion is the bell knocking in the New Year. The ""Puxin Pavilion Welcome Bell Ceremony"", ""Nanshan Seoul Tower"" and ""East Coast Watching the Sunrise"" are the most representative New Year's Eve activities in South Korea. At midnight on December 31st, Puxin Pavilion will spend the New Year with citizens and tourists in Seoul with 33 bells.  In addition to the Mayor of Seoul, 11 social persons are selected through the Internet to ring the bells of the New Year through the Internet. Tens of thousands of people will gather together near Zhongge. In addition to the bell campaign, various performances will be held along the Metro Zhongge Station.  Before the epidemic, the author experienced the ""Puxin Pavilion Welcome Bell Cerebrate Ceremony"" New Year's Eve event. Starting on the evening of December 31st, the tranquil bell area will flow into a large number of crowds. The later the more people, the more people, and in the cold night of the body temperature to minus 15 degrees Celsius, the author and friends come to Puxin Pavilion. It feels wonderful to be pushed forward without moving in the sea of people. Waiting for the New Year, you can watch various performances along the Zhongge Station. If you are hungry, you can go to the commercial street near Zhongge to eat snacks. The atmosphere is very active. When the countdown is almost counting, there are passers -by sending free balloons. At 12 o'clock, with the deep bells of Puxin Pavilion, everyone let go of the balloon in their hands and hug each other around them to congratulate the New Year. It is cold, but people are very warm.  Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, coupled with the winter cold flow, Seoul's New Year's Eve atmosphere has faded a lot in recent years. Puxin Pavilion has canceled the New Year's bell campaign for two consecutive years and changed to online recording. Although the citizens could not go to the scene to feel the lively New Year's Day atmosphere and feel that the traditional atmosphere is lacking, the bells of the online welcome have conveyed new dreams and hope to all citizens.  The bell knocking ceremony in 2021 is different from previous years, and the ""Yuan Universe"" element has been added. The Seoul government uses 360 -degree virtual reality VR technology, allowing citizens to watch Putin Pavilion's panorama online through virtual identity, participate in the bell campaign and take photos For sake of comments, many citizens leave a message saying that it feels fresh and interesting. The Korean media called it the prelude to the opening of the Seoul's universe ecosystem. In addition to continuing online recording and broadcasting in 2022, in addition to continuing to recording online and broadcasting, it is also made into multiple micro -version of the big clock models to put it outside Seoul, allowing local residents to knock on the bell and record a congratulatory video.",Korean history; Puxin Pavilion;

Reality has made Taiwan's so -called ""epidemic prevention myth"" a joke.  The Taiwan Epidemic Prevention Command Center announced on the 10th that 50,828 confirmed cases were added to the island that day, including 50,780 local cases and 48 cases of overseas inputs. However, Chen Shizhong, a Taiwan epidemic commander, ""calmly"" that although the number of diagnosis diagnosis on the 10th increased by 25%over the past, most of them increased milder, and the proportion of medium -level disease did not increase as fast as possible. The Taiwan ""Ministry of Education"" announced on the 10th that 6118 cases were confirmed to be diagnosed on the 10th, and 51177 students at all levels were infected.  ""World No. 1"", Taiwan media reported on the 10th to report confirmed cases on the island. According to the Lianhe Daily, according to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the top number of new diagnosis in the world on the 9th is South Korea, with 39,000 diagnosis, followed by 35,000 cases in Australia, and then in order to follow up in turn. Japan's 34,000, 30,000 Italy, 29,000 in France, 14,000 in the United States, 8,000 in Thailand and 7000 in Germany. Because Taiwan is not a member of the WHO and has not been included in the ranking; if it is included, more than 40,000 confirmed diagnosis is added on the 9th, ""we have surpassed all regions and ranked first in the world.""  It is worth noting that Chen Shizhong revealed on the 9th that it was planned to reduce the COVID-19 from the fifth legal infectious disease to the fourth category in July, and when the COVID-19 was reduced to the fourth category, it means that the confirmation will be announced anymore. Numbers, ""Because the relevant information will not be collected at that time, it is difficult to publish the number.""  Taipei City Councilor Luo Zhiqiang said angrily on the 10th that the U.S. -South Korea and other episodes and even the world have no cases because of the large number of diagnostic people? Only Chen Shizhong in Taiwan said, ""It is really the world's first place, the world's first place, the number of diagnosis in the world is the first in the world. He helplessly lamented that the people of Taiwan really wanted to be blessed. Zhao Shaokang, chairman of ""Zhongguang"", said on the 10th that if he borrowed the first level, he pretended to be stupid and did not announce the epidemic. He said that the DPP authorities are best to do a good job in epidemic prevention. ""Let the world look at jokes.  At the same time, the ""fast screen chaos"" that lasted for many days still spread on the island. Chen Shizhong claims that the current brand -name levy label is Luo Shi, which can supply 50 million doses this month. In the middle of the month, there will be 45 million doses of contracts, which will be provided until the end of June. He estimates that there will be at least 50 million to 60 million doses by the end of May, and 90 million doses can be supplied by the end of June. But in fact, all parts of the island are still being purchased. ""China Times"" reported on the 10th of the old man named Hong in Taipei City. At 8 am on the 9th, she lined up in Guisui Street to buy fast sieve test agents. Because she rushed out and did not have breakfast, she stood up for a long time, resulting in low blood sugar and sitting on the ground directly. Even so, she was still reluctant to go to the hospital, but insisted on lining to the end, and wait for the pharmacy to open the door to buy fast screening.  Huang Shanshan, deputy mayor of Taipei City, said that the authorities do not say that there are 100 million fast screens. Taipei, New Taipei, and Keelung are places where the epidemic is more serious. Citizens must be negative to go to work and work. Essence The Democratic Progressive Party, Zheng Wencan, directly faced with Chen Shizhong, said that the safety of the fast screen reagents must be more than 10%of the population, because there is a need at any time. In fact, Taoyuan City has no safety reserve. There are surplus, and now they are in a state of shortage. The Tainan City Health Bureau also said that although the authorities have launched the real -name system of the fast screen test agent, the supply is still in short supply.  On the 9th, the Kuomintang ""Legislative Yuan"" party group requested the prosecution department to investigate the disadvantages of the epidemic as soon as possible, and at the same time went to the Taipei Procuratorate to claim that Chen Shi was suspected of Tu Li and malfeasance. ""Taiwan's single -day diagnosis is the world's first, do Chen Shizhong know?"" The United Daily News commented on the 10th that Chen Shizhong may not know that when the epidemic around the world is retreating, the number of confirmed diagnosis in Taiwan has recently soared. Pushing himself to the highest point in the world, ""the problem is, what is the honor of such a championship record?"" Despite this, Chen Shizhong still proudly ""three cards and five tubes"", which is more bad for the release of the fast screen reagent. It is better to look at the people's queues, and they must also hurry up. It is these disastrous and sequential scene that made British media shocked to a large diagnosis as a ""model of epidemic prevention"".  The article said that Canada's fast screen reagents are placed on supermarket shelves for the public to take for free; in the United States and Singapore, people can make demand online and send them to the home for free. On the other hand, the public has to queue up the queue to buy a quota, the price is twice as much higher than that of other regions. Some people want to buy overseas reagents on the Internet. The DPP authorities have intimidated that this violates the ""Medical Equipment Law"" and can be fined $ 30,000 to 1 million yuan. Once a 'netizen, probably did not expect to have this day, letting the world see the ""New Taiwan Model"" after painting. """,Confirmation cases; Taipei City;

On the one hand, the WHO and many national health experts have repeatedly warned the global anti -epidemic situation that is not optimistic, and the rigorous abandonment of strict epidemic prevention measures may lead to the emergence of the epidemic. On the other hand, some voices questioned China's ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" policy, arguing that ""unsustainable"" and encouraging China to change the policy as soon as possible.  We believe that when the global epidemic is still running high and many countries fall into anti -epidemic fatigue, it is not surprising that there are various sounds. The key is to start from the actual situation of various countries, take out a responsible attitude and action to avoid adding new confusion to global anti -epidemic. For China, the evaluation of outsiders can be ""willful"", but our own choices cannot sway.  As we all know, since the outbreak, many politicians and public opinion agencies in the West have been trying to shape this scientific issue as the ""route dispute"" of the East and the West, and it must make China a ""failure"" party. Based on this position, they initially declared that China's resistance was ""chaotic"". After paying a heavy life price of their country, they kept performing a ""shaking pot"" drama. Today, while they are helpless ""lying"" in their country, they say three or four to China who did not ""lie down"", and they are self -explanatory.  According to the evaluation of the WHO, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the number of ""excess deaths"" caused by the direct or indirect of the COVID-19 epidemic situation is about 14.9 million, which is almost officially reported to the statistics of the WHO statistics from various countries. 3 times. Who is responsible for these unfortunate lives? China is a large population country, with a large population, unbalanced regional development, and insufficient medical resources. If it is not ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", the global death numbers will be even more shocking. The latest research results of scientists between China and the United States also show that if China rashly abandon the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it may lead to more than 1.5 million people dying from the COVID-19 epidemic.  Just saving many lives, the meaning of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is difficult to estimate. In addition to the elderly and other high-incidence people, the long-term impact of COVID-19 virus on children is also unknown. A total of more than 13 million children in the United States were diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 200,000 children unfortunately became ""COVID-19 orphans."" There are more than 300 million people in the United States, and China's population is more than 1.4 billion. Our ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" focuses on the present and cares about the future.  It is also necessary to see that the epidemic is the culprit of dragging the economy. Related data show that in the first quarter of this year, the US GDP fell by about 1.4%; the GDP increase in the 19 member states of the euro zone was 0.1%compared with the previous quarter. Economic growth is affected by multiple factors, but ""lying flat"" and ""coexist"" obviously have not brought an expected positive effect. In February this year, Britain, which announced the implementation of the ""Coexistence with COVID-19"", its medical system is undergoing unprecedented pressure. Due to the repeated epidemic, it is difficult for schools and enterprises to maintain normal operation. ""1/10 people are sick"" Essence With the changes in the epidemic and the dispute over interest, some western countries in the United States have repeatedly tossed in the cycle of ""blocking -slowing the epidemic -relaxation control -the rebound of the epidemic -re -block"", which directly dragged down the country's development and global economic recovery.  In contrast, due to adherence to scientific and precise, ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and efficiently coordinating the prevention and control of epidemic and economic and social development, China became the only major economy in the world in the world to achieve positive economic growth. In 2021 110 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.1%over 2020, making important contributions to maintaining the stability and security of the global industrial chain and supply chain. It is also necessary to point out that China's ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is not the pursuit of zero infection, but ""striving to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, and minimize the impact of epidemic on economic and social development."" Some people in the West opposed the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" with economic development, not based on scientific and rational analysis, but out of ideological prejudice.  A fact that cannot be avoided is that the popular COVID-19 is far from over, and the Omikon poison strains are still mutating. According to reports, the mutant strains of 30%higher than the existing Omikon have landed in South Korea. The six cases of infection reported by the current report are all imported from the United States. This is the time to step up hard work, not the moment when you lie down. "" In this case, China's adherence to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the responsibility to the global epidemic prevention and control. Those behaviors of those who are incompetent and asking others to follow ""lying down"" are arrears in science and morality; those countries that ignore their lives and ""shake the pot"" should be questioned and condemned Essence  Since 2020, from emergency surrounds of emergencies to the prevention and control exploration of normalization epidemic, from the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" of full-chain prevention and control to comprehensive comprehensive prevention and control ""scientific and precise, dynamic Zero-Covid"", China The epidemic prevention and control policy has been advancing and continuous improvement with the times. We believe that adhering to the people's first, life -first, and adhering to everything from the actual situation. China's epidemic prevention and control policy can stand the test of historical testing and can also make greater contributions to global unity resistance.",epidemic prevention and control;

On the 11th, in response to the media ’s general director of the WHO Tan Desai, there were some questions about China's“ Zero-Covid ”policy. Infection is to control the epidemic at the lowest social cost, to the maximum to ensure the health of the people's lives and normal production and life, and to ensure the safety and physical health of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. He said that the majority of people and most people in China have normal production and life, and China's national infection rate and mortality have maintained the lowest level in the world. Zhao Lijian emphasized that the Chinese government has formulated and implemented the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" policy from its own national conditions. Due to the continuous adjustment of prevention and control measures due to the situation, there is only one purpose, that is, to the greatest extent to protect people's lives and health, and at the same time, good prevention and control of prevention and control and control Ensure to ensure the sustainable and stable development of the economy and society. China is completely found, conditional, and capable of achieving ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  On the same day, a predictive study of the Chinese epidemic has aroused widespread media attention. The study stated that if China abandon the strict ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" policy, it may lead to more than 1.5 million people dying from the COVID-19 epidemic. According to the Hong Kong ""South China Morning Post"" reported on the 11th, a model constructed by researchers from China -US universities and institutions showed that considering the existing vaccine effectiveness and vaccination rate, if China does not take epidemic prevention and control measures, a wave of in March of this year is not adopted. The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the 20 cases of the infection of the Omikon mutant strain may ""set off a COVID-19 case tsunami"" in China from May to July this year.  The study showed that during the 6 -month simulation period, Omikon's popularity was expected to lead to 5.08 million hospitalized hospitalization, and 2.67 million person -times to stay in the intensive care unit and 1.55 million people. 3.60 ‰, 1.89 ‰ and 1.10 ‰. The 60 -year -old and above elderly people who have not been vaccinated will ""contribute"" 74.7%of their deaths. The reality is that as of March 18, 2022, the vaccination rate of vaccines at the age of 60 and above in my country was low, only about 80%, and about 52 million elderly people had not yet vaccinated the vaccine.  Researchers predict that in the absence of prevention and control policies, in order to reduce the peak occupation rate of the intensive care unit to the state tolerable scope and reduce the number of deaths each year to the seasonal influenza level (that is, 88,000 people die each year ), The vaccination rate of the elderly in China should reach 97%, and more than half of the symptoms of infections need to be treated with antiviral treatment. If these two conditions cannot be achieved, the most optimistic strategy is to rely on strict epidemic prevention policies to avoid the overload of the medical and health system.

In 2013, the gaming revenue of this small town surpassed Las Vegas and became the richest gaming center in the world. Before the outbreak, Macau averaged 2 million tourists in Macau. However, Beijing's anti -corruption operation (and epidemic) forced Macau to reduce dependence on the gaming industry. Investigations of mainland tourists have shown that their concepts have also changed, and tourists are becoming more and more interested in attractions outside Macau gaming industry. In 2019 before the epidemic, Macau received 39 million tourists and 90%of mainland tourists.  In terms of entertainment, Macau tries to attract tourists who do not want to go to the casino, such as holding concerts. Gaming companies have invested billions of dollars to build exhibition halls to attract tourists -those incentive measures provided by employers, or tourists traveling for meeting and exhibitions.  Macau has also improved the retail and food experience, but it is mainly in the casino resort. Former Chief Marketing Officer of Galaxy Entertainment and Kevin Clydon, Vice President of the Ministry of Operation of the Sands China Market, said: ""Operators also believe that diversification is good for its business. Wonderful content to attract the entire Asian tourists. ""  Another obstacle facing Macau is the lack of land. To solve this problem, in September last year, the Central Government designed a SAR (Hengqin, Guangdong -Macao Deep Cooperation Zone), a 3x Dajima in Macau to help Macau expand industries other than the gaming industry and achieve realization to achieve realization and achieve realization. Diversified development. There is an amusement park on Hengqin Island, which is already a popular tourist destination. The construction of Hengqin Guangdong -Australia's deep cooperation zone is considered to be a good strategy to resolve the ""stubborn disease"" in Macau. Many people believe that this move is an important measure to promote the integration of Macau into the Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macao Greater Bay Area.",Gaming Industry;

The United States CNN commented on the second ""COVID-19 Epidemic Global Video Summit"" held by the United States on the 12th. Although the United States tried to continue to create the image of the leader of the epidemic and the ""World Vaccine Library"" at the summit, because the US President Biden was still struggling to strive for anti -epidemic funds at home and abroad, American public opinion did not seem to be optimistic about the summit effect. The White House spokesman Puski recently said that the summit will emphasize the need for Congress to obtain more funds.  Biden delivered a video speech at the 2nd ""COVID-19 Epidemic Global Video Summit"" on the 12th. ""Today, we commemorate a tragic milestone: 1 million Americans died in the Covid-19 virus. There are 1 million air chairs around the dining table. Each life is an irreplaceable loss."" Biden also issued a statement requesting the White House, federal agencies, military places, and embassies from abroad, and so on, until May 16.  In his speech, Biden emphasized that he asked Congress to ask for the urgency of $ 22.5 billion. ""This is essential for domestic vaccine, treatment and testing, and promoting global anti -epidemic."" Biden also said, ""Today, we are in a new stage of fighting against this class, facing a series of changing challenges. We must double the efforts. To ensure that we provide reliable, predictable vaccines and strengthening needle supply to everyone around the world, and expand testing and treatment globally.

On the 12th, some rumors about Beijing's ""silent"" and ""sealing city"" appeared on the Internet, causing some Beijing citizens to go to the supermarket to buy them. However, on the 12th, the Beijing Epidemic Prevention and Control Conference opened a rumor that ""sealing city"" and ""silent"" are rumors.  Beijing rumor ""three days of static management""  On the 12th, a reporter from the Global Times visited several communities in the surrounding communities and found that the personnel who purchased materials were indeed more than ever, and the team's team was slightly longer than ever, but the overall order and the goods were relatively sufficient. A number of citizens said in an interview with the Global Times reporter that they added some living materials that day, such as fresh vegetables, milk, etc. After all, they were used in daily life, but they did not stock up on a large scale.  At the press conference of Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control on May 12, Xu Hejian, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government, spokesman Xu Hejian rumored the rumors of ""Beijing will carry out three-day static management"" circulating on the Internet. Xu Hejian said that Beijing will organize regional nucleic acid screening in an orderly manner, only to advocate citizens to reduce flow. The so -called ""sealing city"" and ""silence"" are rumors, and it is even unnecessary to grab food and stock up.  Xu Hejian also called for no rumors, rumors, and rumors, and obtained authoritative information from authoritative channels.

The sequence comparison results are prompted that there are two independent communication chains in the city, both of which are related to the recently -ex -Beijing epidemic and spillover. The virus sequence of other provinces and cities is completely consistent. At present, the spread chain is basically clear, and the new infected people who have clearly specified the source of infection are associated with epidemiological diseases. There is still a source of hidden infection in the society, and the spread of epidemic is not completely blocked.

During the screening of nucleic acid, the home office was advocated on the 13th, and the home rest was rest on the 14th and 15th to reduce the participation of nucleic acid testing on the spot.  An unnamed illness and control expert said in an interview with the Global Times on the 12th that the most efficient measures taken by Beijing in this epidemic prevention and control are large -scale and high -frequency nucleic acid testing services to facilitate the people. ""Because Omikon's strains are too hidden, only high -frequency nucleic acid detection can be found. Beijing has a very dense arrangement of nucleic acid detection points. People do not have to go downstairs. The regional control and control of the city did not have the impact of the city's operation to the greatest extent, ""the expert said.

Zhao Dandan said that through the efforts of all parties, the number of newly added infected people in Shanghai has declined as a whole, and fewer new positive infections found outside the isolation control and control are increasing, the risk of social epidemic is effectively controlled, the epidemic trend has stabilized to a good Essence At the same time, we should also see that the current results are not stable, and the risk of rebound still exists. Instant risk areas such as old communities, urban villages and other key risks need to continue to promote the tackling work. The good situation reversed, so that all parties worked hard to abandon their hard work.  Shenzhen National Infectious Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center and Dean of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital Lu Hongzhou said in an interview with a reporter from the Global Times on the 12th that Shanghai still needs to consolidate the hard -to -control prevention and control results. The repeated number of diagnosis cases rebounded with a small scale of the epidemic. At the same time, the city's logistics support should be strengthened to prevent secondary problems.

In addition, 2022 is the 25th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the 55th anniversary of TVB Taiwan.

Curins said that there will be a kind of dedication in variety shows: music is not the first, the ratings are, so you will choose some old songs, plus the current song is difficult to achieve the well -known effect, making the nostalgic style become the mainstream of the mainstream. Essence Does this mean that there are no high -quality songs now? ""Not. In the past, listening to song channels was very single, there were few songs, and it was easy to be red -now it is a song to find a song, not a song to find someone. There are actually many good songs, but the difficulty finding is increasing.""  Whether the COVID-19 epidemic affects the creation of the musician and hinders the birth of excellent works, Kerchins said that he feels good as the author of the word. It is also online communication. ""As long as the creator is loyal to his heart, the epidemic will inspire creative inspiration without hindering the appearance of good songs.""  Some opinions believe that the Chinese music scene today is not as good as that of the currently on the list of traffic singers, which leads to red people, not songs. Kerchins believes that this statement is not comprehensive, and most of the audiences are not listening to traffic songs, nor do they watch the rankings. Although there are also some professional rankings worthy of attention, the list occupied by the traffic singer is more like the internal carnival of the fan circle, and ""the Chinese music scene will not be destroyed by the list.""  How can the current Chinese music scene create classics? Kerchins believes that creators cannot predict whether the work will become a classic, and can only try to write songs that are loyal to the heart and reflect the times. ""The song has its own life. It was also because when I bought a record at the time, I devoted my feelings and merged my memories.

U.S. President Biden delivered a record of ""a tragic milestone"": 1 million Americans died in Covid-19 Essence The failure of the United States' resistance is shocking, and it has a strong contrast with its ""leadership position"" that deliberately played at the video ""summit"".  It is said that everything can help the international community's efforts to unite and resist and scientific resistance, but the world regrets that even if the global epidemic is still raging, the country's resistance fails, Washington still greatly engages in the politics of the epidemic, insisted on insisting on The Taiwan side was invited to attend the conference to deliberately politics that belonged to science. This also once again shows that Washington's interest in the world has provoked opposition and conflict and fascinating from China.  Some White House officials claimed that the United States ""helped raise"" over $ 3 billion for resistance at the summit and promised to take out $ 200 million for global public health. This part of the United States' own pocket, compared with the outside world, previously said that the prediction of the United States may be ""ginseng"" is already ""super expected."" Before the summit, the White House proposed an additional $ 22.5 billion to the COVID-19 epidemic, of which $ 5 billion was used for global resistance, but the proposal was put on hold by Congress. The ""internal power checks and balances"" in the United States are of course a reason, but who knows whether from the beginning, the White House and Congress of the United States and Congress are not advocating each other? The so -called ""generous sacity"" was originally the illusion of fooling the world.  Of course, Washington also has a ""generous"" place, that is, continuously output ""political viruses"" to the outside world. Since the COVID-19 epidemic, the United States does not put energy on controlling the epidemic and saving life, but to engage in political manipulation that violates science and disrupt unity. Throw your own responsibility to resist the responsibility of pushing your own resistance to China. Today, under the manipulation of Washington politicians, the politicalization of the epidemic is still renovating, and ""political virus"" is also constantly ""mutation"".  As the country with the most abundant medical resources and the strongest medical technology in the world, the United States has originally had conditions to play a greater role in global resistance. However, as we all know, when the leader must first have a public heart and abandon his selfish thoughts; secondly, you must take the lead in the first place and lead by example. I have to say that the performance of the United States in these two leadership elements is extremely bad. A global anti -epidemic student cannot have any appeal before making its own resistance. The practice of private goods in global public health issues is even more disgusted.  Perhaps it was a guilty conscience. Before the US Public Opinion, the public expectations were reduced, saying that compared with the first summit, this time, ""may see a small -scale targeted commitment and action."" In fact, most of the various commitments made by the United States at the first summit were not fulfilled. Washington has boasted that he has assisted many vaccines from foreign countries, and included a string of dazzling numbers on the ""Summary Report"", but in fact, the vaccines donated to developing countries are about to expire. However, even such a "" ""Donation"" is not ""free"", and even a lot of political conditions are added.  Some African media once bluntly pointed out that when the United States tried to trace the source of political epidemic and throwing a pot in China, China was providing vaccines to developing countries. Since the occurrence of the epidemic, China has not only proposed the concept of human health and health community, but also announced the earliest vaccine as a global public product. It has provided more than 2.2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. When the global epidemic is raging, who is contributing to the unknown global resistance and who is doing political manipulation by borrowing the epidemic. Others can clearly see that Washington should also understand.  Although Washington is good at politicizing the epidemic, we still remind that most of the countries, regions and international organizations participating in the ""Summit"" are to seek solutions, not toasting and worshiping the United States of hegemony. With one mouth, Washington can never obtain the so -called ""global leadership"" in the United States in resistance.",Washington; leader;

Chen Shizhong also acknowledged that the PCR volume can be completely saturated.  The island's anti-epidemic chaos is overwhelmed. On the 13th, Chen Shizhong voted for the United States ""Washington Observer"", with the topic of ""how Taiwan successfully controlled the COVID-19 epidemic"" as the title. Health is the vision of basic human rights ""and the UN's vision of sustainable development goals"" without omissions "", allowing Taiwan to participate in WHA. This operation attracted the lack of netizens on the island: Now the preparation of fast screening, children's vaccine and antiviral drugs are insufficient. ""Where can I see it as success?""

The night fell temporarily, and her phone rang, and the nurse asked her to look at the direction of the ward. They turned on the lights of Charlie's room and let Laura know which house it was. Three weeks later, Charlie died. Laura was asked to wear a full set of protective equipment into the ward. ""They don't let me touch him. I don't know the temperature of his body."" She stood on the side of her husband's body and called the children video calls to let them look at the father's body before being transported away.  I almost got the vaccine  In the Kelville in Texas, the Mengle family knew that the COVID-19 vaccine was about to come out as the holiday season approached at the end of 2020. There is reason to be optimistic, which shows that a country that is tired of death and chaos will soon start to get rid of the epidemic.  But the virus did not stop spreading. As a doctor's Antande Mengle, he felt uncomfortable on the Thanksgiving weekend, and he was infected with Covid-19. Rachel, the daughter of the doctor, said: ""I remember my dad told us, 'I am very excited to the vaccine, and we will all vaccinate, and we can meet as before."" His father died. She was sad and she did not want to vaccinate, but her mother insisted that she should come as planned. After the vaccination, Rachel cried. ""I remember I thought at the time:‘ Dad almost (I can get the vaccine). ’”  Threatened and returned  Until now, Nicole Waterchs still struggle with the unbearable realistic conflict she faced in the summer of 2021. She lives in Bilson, one of the most lively communities in Chicago. In June of that year, her 23-year-old sister Emily died of Covid-19, and her surrounding lively suddenly made her feel cruel. ""People open a party outside my house and don't wear a mask. I still try to deal with this kind of discord.""  For many Americans, last summer started in a while, and the stability of the epidemic showed that it was finally weakened. But later, Delta mutated strains raging the south, causing more than 2,000 people every day.  Nursing Norn Norland, a nurse in the South Carolina, still feels the pain caused by this transformation. At that time, her 85 -year -old mother Stolkad was convinced that the threat had passed and insisted on not vaccination. But Stakad eventually infected the Covid-19 virus and died in August last year. A few months later, Nolan said she was still difficult to get out. Throughout the United States, when Delta mutated strains came, each community was shocked. Obviously, the epidemic is far from over.  ""She has other diseases before?""  He died in COVID-19 and was seen in another eye. Sam Bisen's wife Jennifer died of this disease. He said: ""If someone says that my husband dies from cancer, or my son dies in a car accident, he gets a direct sympathy. But if anyone says that my wife died in COVID-19, people said the first one said the first one. The sentence is: 'She had other diseases before?' ""  Now, Billon is still tortured by people around. These people may fade the threat of the COVID-19 virus, or it is not true, or sharing false information on Facebook. He said that even those who know Jennifer will share emoticons that laugh at the vaccine.  Rachel Pitoniak's grandfather Andrew died of COVID-19, and she was shocked by the practice of not paying attention to relevant risks. At a college she taught, when she asked students to wear a mask, she was sometimes resisted or white -eyed. Rachel said, whether it is face -to -face or on social media, the random comment he encountered repeatedly showed that life like her grandfather was ignored.",Delta; wearing a mask;

Among them, industrial production has slowed down, but the high -tech manufacturing industry has maintained rapid growth. From January to April, the added value of industrial industries above designated size increased by 4.0%year-on-year, 2.5 percentage points from January-March, and the added value of high-tech manufacturing industries increased by 11.5%year-on-year.

Pan and Lin, the co -director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center of Zhejiang University International Commercial School of Business, and Lin were interviewed by the Global Times reporter on the 16th that affected by the epidemic, the manufacturing performance in April was not satisfactory, but the current Shanghai epidemic has gradually eased. , And starting in stages and re -production, the situation will be greatly alleviated in the future. Therefore, Panhelin believes that the bottleneck status of the industrial added value in April should be short -term; in terms of consumption, in May, with the launch of bailout measures in various places, especially the use of consumer coupons, consumption in many regions will have some consumption in many regions. recover.  In the second quarter, it will still maintain a better growth  In response to the question of ""the possibility of negative growth in the second quarter"", Fu Linghui responded that the main industrial and service industries in the month in April did not mean that the entire economic operation in the second quarter would decline. I believe that in the second quarter, it will still maintain a good growth trend. Fu Linghui said that the epidemic in Jilin, Shanghai and other places has been effectively controlled, and the re -production and re -production are promoted in an orderly manner. A series of policies and measures such as expanding domestic demand, helping enterprises relieve rescue, guarantee stability, and ensure people's livelihood. Economic operation is expected to improve.  Whether the target of 5.5%growth throughout the year can be achieved  Recently, many foreign institutions have put forward different views on China ’s 5.5%economic growth goals throughout the year. Fu Linghui responded that“ there have been many factors that have exceeded expectations this year, and economic operations do face many difficulties. It is short -term and temporary. From the perspective of the whole year, there are still many favorable conditions for the stable growth of China's economy. ""  Fu Linghui believes that these favorable conditions include: at present, the stage of prevention and control of the epidemic has achieved phased results, and the effect of resumening and re -production has gradually emerged; the effect of steady investment in investment will continue to be played, and infrastructure and manufacturing investment support will be strong; Facing a certain pressure, but there are still many favorable conditions for continuous growth.  Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, said in an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 16th that the downward pressure on the Chinese economy still exists, but the momentum of long -term high -quality development has not changed. Once the epidemic is effectively controlled, coupled with the power of finance and monetary policy, the economy is expected to recover. He believes that in the second quarter or the lowest point of economic growth throughout the year, but after the third quarter, it is expected to gradually rise, and the goal of achieving steady growth throughout the year is still worth looking forward to.",added value; economic operation; economic data; investigation of unemployment rate; steady growth;

Shanghai government officials announced on the 16th that the epidemic prevention was ""phased ""Effectiveness"", and announced the next ""three stages"" prevention and control arrangements, which has received extensive attention from domestic and foreign public opinion. ""Voice of Germany"" stated that Shanghai proposed the most specific ""expected sealing timetable"" on the 16th. It was also from the same day that Shanghai promoted the resumption of commercial and resumed market stages. Many Shanghai citizens living in the defense zone told the Global Times reporter that they have been able to go out in ""part -time periods"", and some stores near the community open doors and provide retail services. At the same time as the normal order of ""comprehensive recovery"" is approaching Shanghai step by step, experts interviewed by the Global Times reminded the epidemic in the process of rebounding in the process of resumed production and re -marketing and re -marketing. At the same time, some other cities in China are also facing epidemic prevention challenges: since the new round of epidemic on the 9th of Guang'an City, Sichuan Province, there have been 34 cases of local confirmed cases and 467 cases of non -symptoms in the local area. state.  ""The clearest timetable so far""  ""The number of new cases in China on the 15th 1227 cases of VS 1,789 cases a day ago."" In a report on the 16th report, British Reuters compared the two -day epidemic data of China: On the 14th, 239 cases of newly confirmed cases (226 in 226 cases in the local area ), 1550 newly -free infected infections (1492 cases); 151 newly confirmed cases (140 cases of local cases), and 1076 cases of non -symptoms (1019 cases).  According to the Shanghai Health and Health Commission reported on the 16th, from 0:00 on the 15th to 24:00, the city added 69 new local COVID-19 confirmed cases, and 869 newly added infections were added. In the 16 districts of Shanghai, 15 districts have achieved social Zero-Covid.  ""Shanghai announced the clearest timetable so far."" The Guardian ""Guardian"" said on the 16th that at the press conference held on the day, Zong Ming, deputy mayor of Shanghai, announced the next ""three stages"" prevention and control work: by May On the 21st, the number of people in the control areas and control areas continued to be reduced, and the preventive area of the prevention area was orderly liberalized, limited flow, and effective control; In mid -to -late month, under the premise of strictly preventing the rebound of the epidemic and controllable risks, the normalized management of the epidemic prevention and control is fully implemented to fully restore the normal production and living order of Shanghai.  ""Unconsispy? Shanghai: In June, it resumed normal production and life."" From the report of ""Voice of Germany"" on the 16th, Shanghai gave the most specific and clear ""unblocking"" steps since the adopted control measures were adopted on the same day. The article says that many local people are happy to see this signal and see that the epidemic prevention has achieved significant results, but some people have a wait -and -see attitude towards the ""unblocking"" process.  Singapore's ""Lianhe Zaobao"" said on the 16th that Shanghai ushered in a good news -that day, it began to promote the re -commercial and resumption in stages. Among them, commercial outlets such as shopping malls, department stores, supermarket stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, and pharmacies gradually restore offline business in an orderly manner; haircut services have gradually recovered in an orderly manner, and peaks are implemented.  Ms. Chen, resident of Xuhui District, went out on the 16th. She told the Global Times reporter that she needs to make an appointment to go to the hospital and hold a 48 -hour nucleic acid test report. Essence Another resident who lives in the Songjiang Defense Zone told reporters that they can now enter and exit with the entry and exit cards, once every two days, go out to purchase during the prescribed period, and many stores around the community have opened the door to provide retail services. A citizen living in Jiading District told the Global Times reporter that the nearby communities nearby can start on the 8th, and they can use Ding Dong and hungry when they are at home. ""We are divided into the surgery of the nearby communities. You can go to purchase. In the application, you can see that the whole family, Rosen and other convenience stores and some restaurants are open, providing takeaway services.""  A staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Government told the Global Times reporter on the 16th that many residents in the defense areas in the suburbs can be out of the community. The premise is that the relevant communities have not been upgraded and the environment of the streets and towns is also safe.  How Shanghai gradually resumes transportation operations has also attracted foreign media's attention. Russia's CPPCC said that starting from May 22, the city's ground public transport and rail transit can gradually resume operations. Reuters said on the 16th that ""a signs of hope"" were that the Shanghai subway operator began to test the train to prepare for re -opening. In addition, railways gradually increased the number of Shanghai Hongqiao Station and Shanghai Station until the number of trains.  Lu Hongzhou, Dean of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, said in an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 16th that in the process of resumed and resumed production and resumption of production, Shanghai still faced the risk of the epidemic rebound. Therefore, Shanghai should do a good job of ""place code"" to ensure that citizens maintain high -frequency nucleic acid detection, which helps to quickly discover potential sources of infection and cut off the risk of transmission of epidemic in a timely manner. For the industries where medical and express delivery, such as more contact people, we must focus on preventing aggregate communication incidents.  Beijing is in a ""stalemate state""  According to Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 15:00 on the 15th to 15:00 on the 16th, there were 39 new local COVID-19 virus infections. From April 22nd to May 16th, a total of 1113 COVID-19 virus infections in Beijing involved 15 districts.  ""The current contest of Beijing and the epidemic is still in a state of stalemate. It is sporadic cases to interweave the clustering epidemic, and the virus transmission chain is not completely blocked."" ""Lianhe Zaobao"" said on the 16th that the official countermeasures of Beijing are: the epidemic prevention and control is accelerating, and the acceleration of the epidemic is accelerating, and the acceleration is accelerated again, and the epidemic prevention and control are accelerated again, and the acceleration of the epidemic is accelerated. To accelerate, with more resolute and decisive measures, resolutely block epidemic spread and case overflow, and make every effort to wipe out the outbreak.  A reporter from the ""German Editorial Department"" wrote a few days ago that every morning, he could see Beijing people line up for nucleic acid testing. On Saturday, about 21 million throat swabs were performed on Saturday. Inspection, the infected cases were still maintained at a very low level. The reporter said that in the current life, Beijingers seem to discover the enthusiasm for outdoor activities, and he can often see someone jogging on the street.  Outside of Beijing and Shanghai, the epidemic in Guang'an City, Sichuan Province also caused concerns. Since May 9, the city has reported 34 cases of local diagnosis and 467 cases of no symptomatic infected local infection.  ""Lianhe Zaobao"" said that since last week, the epidemic in Guang'an has continued to intensify, and the number of new local cases is second only to Shanghai, causing concerns about ""spillover of the epidemic"". Huang Qiang, the governor of Sichuan Province, recently requested other cities (states) in the province, especially in adjacent areas with Guang'an to ""stare and see the eyes bigger"", and resolutely curb the risk of incremental infected people.  It is reported that neighboring Shuixian is the this round of epidemic centers in Guang'an City. The first infected person to be discovered is an online car driver, and the contact personnel are more complicated. Guang'an City is not far from the densely populated cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing, so strict measures need to be taken to prevent virus diffusion. In addition, from 6:00 on the 16th to 12:00, 22 newly positive infections were added in Tianjin.  The epidemic is alleviating, the economy will rebound  The main economic indicators released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 16th attracted foreign media's attention and interpretation. In April, the growth rate of industrial added value above scale in China decreased by 2.9%year -on -year, and the total retail sales of social consumer goods decreased by 11.1%. The Associated Press said on the 16th that China's downward pressure on the economy increased, but officials in the country emphasized that Shanghai is ""re -opening"" and the economy is expected to improve.  The report quoted Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 16th that more than 9,000 industrial enterprises in Shanghai accounted for nearly 50%. According to the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 16th, the total number of Shanghai Faral and Control District has fallen to within 1 million, and the city's operating commercial outlets have increased from less than 1,400 valleys to 10,625. ""If the (China) epidemic continues to alleviate, the economy should rebound this month."" The Associated Press quoted a report by an economist in the British Kaitou macro company.  For a period of time, some Western media have continued to discredit China's epidemic prevention policy, and it has a negative impact. The Russian ""News"" recently quoted the Russian immunohistic expert Nichola Kiccokovovs that the reason why China takes stricter epidemic prevention measures is because the population density of many cities in China is large, although the proportion of vaccine residents is very high The death rate of COVID-19 virus variants has declined than before, but if the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not implemented, the spread of the virus will bring great harm to the Chinese people.  A comment article in Hong Kong media ""Dongwang"" on the 16th will compare Beijing with Washington's epidemic prevention performance of the so -called ""Global Anti -Video Summit"" last week. The article said that the Chinese government has strong and efficient mobilization and organizational capabilities, adheres to humanitarianism, attaches importance to the safety of each citizen, while the United States pursues the law of weak meat and strong food, allowing vulnerable groups to die. Because of this, the United States has ""shaken the pot"" and ""lying flat"" from the beginning, and China has always adhered to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".","Shanghai; infected person; asymptomatic; ""Global Times""; Epidemic prevention and control; confirmed cases;"

On the morning of May 17th, the National Development and Reform Commission held a regular press conference in May. Meng Wei, deputy director and press spokesman of the Political Research Office of the National Development and Reform Commission, believes that at present, the domestic epidemic rebound has been strongly dealt with. The policy effect is gradually released. It is believed that the normal economic order will recover rapidly, and the economic operation will soon return to the normal track.  Since March, affected by the epidemic, the stable operation of the industrial chain in some key areas and key areas across the country has been impacted. At the press conference on the 17th, Meng Wei said that the Development and Reform Commission will work with relevant departments to dredge the blocking points and card points to promote the re -production of enterprises in an orderly manner, and fully ensure the stable operation of the industrial chain supply chain. For key enterprises such as integrated circuits and other fields, the Development and Reform Commission will help coordinate and resolve issues such as restricted return, poor raw material transportation, and suppliers' production and production facing enterprises to ensure the normal production and operation of the enterprise. Essence  Affected by the epidemic, the difficulty of market subjects across the country increased significantly, and the difficulty of job hunting in some key groups increased. In April, the unemployment rate of urban surveys nationwide was 6.1%, and the employment situation continued to pressure. In terms of stable employment, Meng Wei said that the Development and Reform Commission will focus on promoting four aspects, including guaranteeing employment through the main body of the market. Strengthen the precise support of the manufacturing, contact service industry, small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households, further reduce the burden on market entities, and help them survive their difficulties and keep their positions. In addition Stable employment and strengthen employment support through talent training.  On May 16th, the eighth raising of the domestic refined oil was raised during the year. Due to the impact of the epidemic, the problem of input inflation caused by global currency looseness and the input inflation caused by the Russian and Ukraine conflict is becoming more and more obvious. In April, China's CPI rose to 2.1%, of which the impact of oil prices was more obvious. Meng Wei said that major economies in the world are facing large inflation pressure. High inflation seriously impacted the lives of ordinary people in Europe and the United States, and some families even had a financial crisis. At the same time, China's prices have been running in the overall reasonable range, and the increase is significantly lower than that of other major economies, one high and one low, forming a sharp contrast.  Meng Wei said that in the later period, China has strong economic toughness, large market space, and rich policy tool boxes, especially for food production for many years, sufficient production and agricultural products and services. Keep the price run smoothly.  Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, stated at the National New Office on the 16th that the performance of the Chinese economy in April was a short -term change brought by the impact of the epidemic.

According to reports, the Tianjin spring college entrance examination time was changed to June 12, and COVID-19 positive, closely connected, sub-secret, etc. must not participate.  At the press conference of the Beijing Epidemic Prevention and Control Work on the 18th, Liu Xiaofeng, deputy director of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that at 15:00 on May 17th to 15:00, Beijing will be newly added local COVID-19 virus infection 49 For example, 45 cases of controlling personnel and 4 cases of social screening; 35 of them were related to the recently occurred epidemic. Related risk points and personnel have been controlled.  On the 17th, some communities in Beijing were unblocked. Related requirements for preventing and control management after unblocking the community were a hot spot in the press conference. Liu Xiaofeng said that according to the new unblocking policy, after the unsealed control area was unsealed, the personnel were managed by the management area for 4 days; after the control area was unsealed, the personnel should carry out 4 days of health monitoring. ""Unlieving is not equal to defense"", and the epidemic prevention and control cannot be relaxed at the moment after unblocking. Liu Xiaofeng answered the disinfection of how to scientifically conduct disinfection in the seal control area and the control area. He said that first is to scientifically develop public regional disinfection. The focus of disinfection is the surface where the hands are often contacted, such as the door handle of the unit door, the staircase handrail, the trash bin handle ring, the elevator button and the handrails, the surface of the courier receiver, the public toilet, etc. At the same time, you must do a good job of personal hygiene. The second is to avoid excessive disinfection. There is no need to disinfect air to the external environment. Outdoor green belts, ground, exterior walls, fences, tire tires and other outdoor environments such as tires are extremely low, and large -scale disinfection is required. Third, family disinfection of uninhabited cases should be clean and supplemented by preventive disinfection.  Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government, said that there are several clustering epidemic in Beijing in succession. Social screening still finds sporadic emitting cases.

The streets and towns with positive cases have continuously carried out three -wheel regional nucleic acid screening.  At the press conference on the same day, according to Liu Xiaofeng, after the analysis of the flow, it was found that some cases have not participated in nucleic acid screening recently, which not only delayed the treatment but also caused the epidemic dissemination, and increased the uncertainty of the epidemic prevention and control.

On the 20th local time, the French Public Health Bureau announced that the first case of ""monkey acne"" infection was found in the French Island area.

On the 20th, the ""Monkey Acne"" epidemic that was first discovered by the United Kingdom on May 7 has spread throughout the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Australia, Germany, France and other Western countries.

""The mortality of infection (monkey acne) is much higher than that of COVID-19, especially now that the French people are no longer inocularly vaccinated as in the past.""  In fact, the ""Monkey Acne"" virus was first discovered on the monkey as early as 1958.

It will hold a variety of folk dance festivals in various places, especially the ""Witch Night"" in Halz Mountain in Germany is the most famous. People will dance ""Witch Dance"" to celebrate. The activity stems from local folklore: When the witch comes in May, the witch will fly to the Broken Mountains, where the spring is celebrating the arrival of spring.  In addition to the ""Witch Dance"", on April 30th, large -scale balls will also be held in various regions of Germany, calling it ""dancing until May"". Because of the epidemic, the ""Witch Night"" activity reduced the scale, but the organizers of the event conducted live broadcasts through social media, attracting thousands of audiences.  ""One party dances, one party appears."" In the villages and towns in Baden-Vottenburg, Baden-Vottenburg, southern Germany, the May pillar event will be held on May 1. On May 1st this year, the reporter of the Global Times just happened to be in Bavaria village. That morning, the people in the village gathered in the village square. Men wearing leather shorts and grid shirts. Women are wearing a tight dress.  When the May column of the white and blue stripes stood up, people began to sing around the pillars. Everyone swayed with the music, and beat the thighs, knees and soles while jumping. At the end of the festival, the competition and acrobatic show climbing May Pillar. After the event, the villagers uploaded festive dance clips to social media and compared with dance in other parts of Germany.  The most rare thing is Munich's hoop craftsman dance. This dance originated during the epidemic period of 1517. At that time, in order to awaken people with music, Munich's hoop craftsmen ignited the courage of rebirth and danced a cheerful dance on the barrel. After that, every seven years, the local bakers industry associations will send members to dance in front of the Munich City Hall.  The new hug of buckets was originally arranged in 2026, but due to the epidemic, the hug barrel industry association broke the rules and performed in May this year. The performance team consists of about 20 dancers and drummer. Dancers are wearing black leather shoes, white socks, black leather pants and red jackets. They held green branches and constantly changed their formation. Finally, the dancers performed the superb drinking action, and then threw the wine glass back in a chic manner, and the clown could catch the glass with a hat. The dance movements are neat and lively, and traditional Bavarian music is also very beautiful.  ""In the epidemic, people love folk dance more."" German cultural scholar Claus said that there are folk dances across Germany, which has received less attention before. In the epidemic, everyone likes dancing. In social media competition, folk dance has become the biggest ""beneficiary"".  Inspirational Dance of Germany  However, the hottest dance in Germany since the epidemic is ""Jerusalem Dance"" from Africa. The ""Jerusalem Dance"" dance step is very simple: one foot moves forward, ordered the floor four times, change the other foot forward, and order the floor four times again. After that, your feet are exchanged lightly, and you can also add some original actions in the dance.  The soundtrack of ""Jerusalem Dance"" ""Jerusalem"" was created by a South African music producer before the epidemic. Later, when several Angola youths ate at the front of the thatched house, they used this song to dance with this song, and recorded a video uploaded to the Internet. Unexpectedly, this dance video became popular in the epidemic. People from all over Europe have ""painted gourds and paintings"", and began to dance such dances, and they all danced collectively, and opened the ""Jerusalem Dance Challenge"" activity. German police, firefighters, postman, stewardess, empty brother, company staff and even prisoners, etc., also actively participated in the challenge.  Ham Hospital in western Germany also participated in the dance challenge. The nurse in the hospital said that the song ""Jerusalem"" expresses the idea of ""no hope if you don't give up"", which is very suitable for jumping during the epidemic. Moreover, dance is easy to learn, full of enthusiasm, and collective dancing. When dancing, they can also maintain social distance. Therefore, doctors and nurses in their hospitals also actively participate in dancing.  After the hospital sent the videos of employees dancing to the social media, they received millions of clicks. The hospital wrote on the webpage: Although the workload of the hospital is close to the limit because of the epidemic, they want to ensure greater cohesion. ""We are glad to motivate each other during difficult times.""  However, when people in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other countries actively participated in the ""Jerusalem Dance Challenge"", the music copyright owner of ""Jerusalem"" sent a letter to the police and other departments to pay the music copyright fee. This made the dancers caught off guard.  80 -year -old ""Internet celebrity""  Although the ""Jerusalem Dance Challenge"" boom cooled down last year, the Germans' enthusiasm for dancing is still hot, and more and more people of different ages have participated in the ""Baying"" activities on social media.  33 -year -old Sophie is the head of a bank. She told reporters that she felt that dancing in social media before was played by young people. In the epidemic, because of working at home, she has more time to browse these videos and learn a lot of dance. After that, she uploaded her dance video for the first time and competit with a company's intern. She couldn't think of being praised by all parties, and it turned into an Internet celebrity. Almost everyone in the company is sending dance videos, which is a way for everyone to contact each other.  Christian, who works at a software company, said that his previous relationship with his mother had been bad and had little communication. During the epidemic, he had more time with his mother. On one occasion, relatives posted a mother -child dance and named him challenged with his mother. As a result, he practiced dance with his mother, recorded video to participate in the challenge, and was well received. After that, he recorded multiple short videos with his mother. Christian said that publishing mothers and child dance videos in social media can bring joy to relatives and friends during the epidemic. The most important thing is to make the mother and child relationship more harmonious.  Many elderly people have become more confident and optimistic because they participate in dance video recording. During the epidemic, Elika, who was in his 80s, released the first just dance short video on the Internet, which attracted the praise of fans. This also helped her to open up the second spring of her career and became a video fitness coach of a TV station. Some cultural scholars said that the starting point of such ""comparison"" activities is low, suitable for any age, full of positive energy, and now it has become a national cultural activity in Germany.",social media; witch dance; folk dance; hoop barrels; Munich

In this context, many people are worried whether the outbreak of monkey acne in many countries means that this will bring another epidemic.  ""Atlantic Monthly"" quoted experts' words that it can be clear that monkey acne virus is not a COVID-19 virus and has completely different characteristics. When the COVID-19 virus first appeared, people were not familiar with it at all, but monkey acne was a known disease. McColum of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that existing studies have found that monkey acne will not spread easily and will not spread through the air long distances.  ""Of course, we have heard these words before."" According to the Atlantic Monthly, in early 2020, many experts claimed that the COVID-19 virus would only spread through the surface or droplets of pollutants. Now people find that the Covid-19 virus can spread through the smaller, can spread farther gas-soluble gel. However, this does not mean that this history will be repeated on the problem of monkey acne. A study in 2021 found that monkey acne virus can survive in gas solid for a few days, but this is in the laboratory environment.  Tomori told the Global Times reporter that people do not have to worry too much about monkey acne virus, because after taking certain measures, this virus will not be as fast as the COVID-19 virus transmitted and can be controlled. In addition, unlike the COVID-19 virus that can be disseminated without symptoms, it is easy to be discovered when the monkey acne virus is spread, because the infected person will develop skin lesions.  According to BBC, the initial symptoms of monkey acne include fever, headache, swelling, back pain, muscle soreness and general weakness. After the fever starts, the rash will appear, often starting from the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The most common is the palm and sole. The rash may be very itchy, and different changes will occur before the scabs are finally dropped. Damage of skin can cause scars. The infection will last 14 to 21 days and usually disappear by itself.  Countries are not powerless to acne. As a preventive measure to cope with biological terrorism, the United States and other countries have reserved ceiling vaccines. There is also an antiviral therapy that can treat monkey acne. However, some experts said that health care workers are most likely to use a method called ""Ring VacCination"" to curb the spread of monkey acne virus. This method refers to the vaccination of close contact with the close contact with the diagnostic case to cut off the transmission pathway. McCallom said that according to the data she saw so far, it may not need to adopt the control strategy other than the ""surrounding vaccine vaccination"". A relatively rare infection (disease). ""  However, experts and other experts also reminded that this does not mean that people can treat monkey acne lightly. Titans emphasized that people's understanding of monkey acne comes from 1,500 cases recorded in the case as of 2018. ""I see many people writing papers, as if our understanding of monkey acne is certainly certain, but in fact , It is still a rare animal preaching disease. Therefore, I still maintain cautious attitude. If we can learn lessons from the COVID-19 epidemic, then (one of them) is to maintain a humble mentality.

After the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Mallen Zilma returned to the countryside from Manila back to the countryside. During the whole epidemic, she woke up almost every day in the rooster. Before the sun was fierce at noon, she would wave a homemade watering kettle to turn around in her garden. Okra, banana trees and the crops in the harvest look eternal. But Zilma's interest in returning to the countryside is new.  Historically, the economic prospects of the city have attracted a large number of Philippine people to leave the countryside, which makes the city overwhelmed. In 1970, less than one -third of the country's population was urban residents; today, 47%of people live in urban areas. In this large population country, the degree of poverty in rural areas is quite serious. The number of labor has exceeded the job. Many people have to go to the city or overseas to send money to go home. This is also a sign of fundamental imbalance between cities and rural areas, qualifications and opportunities, political elites and the reality of ordinary people. This gap has been existed for decades and has not changed because of changes in political or policies. But during the epidemic, people's choices suddenly seemed a little different.  During the epidemic, the job opportunities in the city were greatly reduced. For many new immigrants, the attraction of urban life has gradually disappeared. In rural areas where they are still connected, there are at least food, where they live, and there is no need to contact people. Ms. Zilma, 50, has been a maid and a cashiers in Snack Street in Manila. The money she earns is mainly used to pay for 5 children's college tuition. After the epidemic came, the snack street was closed. She moved to her nephew's house, but she could not maintain her livelihood. At the same time, her husband is old, unable to continue fishing, and children do not work stable. She began to consider returning to my hometown of Leitt Island, who was more than 500 miles away from Manila.  For decades, the Philippine government has formulated some plans to encourage people, especially residents, and move to rural areas. Ms. Zilma got a place in the latest pilot project, as a participant to get funds, living training, relocation assistance and subsidies, and one -way bus or air tickets. Although it was not successful before, the planner of the project was still hopeful.  Zilma and her husband like the current rural life. The 24 -year -old son Riste climbed to the tree and laid a coconut as a snack; in order to get the firewood for cooking, he would cut off the branches. Although their roofs are leaking, they do not need to pay for rent, do not use people, no pollution, no gas costs, and no water fees. However, work is not easy to find. At the end of last year, Riste and his mother returned to the city. He served as auxiliary pharmacist in the city of Taco, but did not give up rural life. He said that he would return to his hometown to open his own pharmacy within 10 years to fill the village's gap in obtaining drugs.  Before that, he would be inevitable that he would recall the days when the epidemic was passing with his family in the early days of the epidemic. One night, the country's home was stopped again.

People start traveling and start retaliatory travel. I tried to recover two years of lost two years through a successive trip. During the May Day, it was Singapore's long weekend. Some friends joked that half of Singapore's population was in Bangkok, including me.  I was anxious to start the first trip after the epidemic  I live in Singapore. It is now basically open to tourists in Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. Friends around me have booked air tickets to travel. I went to Thailand and was no different from the travel procedure before the epidemic. There was no need to test and isolation before and after the departure of tourists. Thailand even canceled the tourism insurance originally forced to purchase. Canceling many restrictions on tourists is the most practical action of tourists.  However, this travel experience is still different from the past, and there is naturally uneasy in excitement.

SIAM Square's most beautiful old movie theater SCALA has not even ruined, becoming a dazzling earthy yellow, and it will be occupied by a ugly building soon, and no one will remember it soon. It's so good to say goodbye, it turned out to be like this.  The Jam Factory on the bank of the Chao Phraya River is still there. Its founder is Duangrit Bunnag, a well -known Thai architect. He transformed this idle jam factory into an office. He retained the structure of the factory and the old banyan tree in the courtyard. The barren space continued to show him its potential and possibilities, so there were restaurants, cafes, and bookstores, and it became a popular punch place in Bangkok shortly after opening. Its restaurant is still the summer that never end, the private dish by the architect's family. The independent bookstore and Wenqing cafe are still there, and the square that is protected by the old tree is still held on weekends. However, the affiliated furniture stores, which were originally sold more expensive but sold well, are now empty. What is necessary and what is not necessary. Under the epidemic, the answer to this choice question is particularly obvious and cruel.  I believe all this is true. If you are still in your dreams, everything should be as usual. It is some subtle changes and some forever. For example, the traffic jams forever before the well -known shopping center Central World (although it has not passed seriously, but it is still quite bad) remind me I really traveled in Bangkok.  The streets of Bangkok are common in Chinese, including shopping malls and subway stations, which shows the contribution of Chinese tourists to the local tourism industry. I chatted with the masseur. She said that her work was not busy. The less tourists also meant a tip. She returned to Bangkok from the hometown north of Thailand 3 months ago to prepare for tourists' arrival. In the past two years, she has no job and can only go back to her hometown temporarily. The Bangkok Palace, which has less Chinese tourists, is indeed much more quiet, but this kind of quiet is not necessarily a good thing for some people. For example, there are obviously more TUK-TUK cars that are obviously that there is no more tourist. A city in Southeast Asian countries). Most of the tourist attractions that are maintained by tourists are mostly unable to lift the absence of tourists in the past two years. The famous food street in Singapore's ox carts cannot be hoped that the spring of the tourism industry is finally closed in October 2021.  Go a place where you want to go but never go  Many tourism media have predicted the tourism trend of the epidemic in the era of epidemic. Tripadvisor, one of the world's largest tourism platforms, announced its tourism report in 2022. The online survey of about 2,000 travelers in various markets found that people most wanted to travel to a place they had never been to before in 2022. In the era of ""unreliable"", what is even more anxious to seize, people have a sense of urgency for everything, and the desire to travel will be put on hold.  In the past, we could say it chic, this time too late, wait for the next time. Who knows that next time is two years, who knows that someone can't wait for the next time. So on the morning before I left Bangkok, I took the boat on the river, shaking, and a place I wanted to go but was too lazy to go. It was the Village of Portugal in Bangkok. There are beautiful Catholic churches in this block, and the buildings are relatively neat, and the descendants of Portuguese -Thailand are lived. The lingering fragrance of cakes in the alley. The Thais learned how to bake the cake from the Portuguese. Several generations of generations used extremely primitive ways in this humble house to make fragrant cakes. I bought a bag of pastry that had just been baked, sat by the Chao Phraya River, and tasted it. It was as good as the taste of this world.",Tourism;
180,Behind the death of 1 million people is a more serious problem,杰西卡·格伦扎;王会聪;,13,2022-05-31,17,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=DNPf6DgFiJvaaXCYMXJfsctKMjumquqg8SKLDyH-T0DCL-s3-TbmHUWAYknww7v8Hy_eTGRcFM2DKmxhfXDhFmWtsCABIMoXN2a4SF0a3kXZQcfrjrNZoVUBi9X01ZG9&uniplatform=NZKPT,"The British ""Guardian"" on May 16th, the original title: The number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States exceeded 1 million, which was higher than that of more than 1 million other countries. The huge population does not explain incredible mortality. According to data from the COVID-19 virus resource center of John Hopkins University, 303 of each 100,000 US residents died of COVID-19. Among the 20 countries affected by the most affected by the epidemic, only Brazil's mortality rate is higher than the United States.  The number of people who died directly to COVID-19 are only an indicator of the impact of the epidemic. In 2021, Americans died of excessive medication reached a new high, reaching at least 100,000. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, and dementia have also increased the number of ""excess deaths"" in the United States. The number also includes the deaths of other diseases that exacerbate the epidemic. Researchers said that the unusual death toll made the United States a ""alternative"" in the rich country, exposing the unfairness, unique and fragmented medical system and polarized politics of the country. ""If you want to know why you have such a bad experience in the epidemic, we have to consider the systemic problems that exist when the epidemic comes."" Urff said.  This epidemic highlights the long-term race and ethnic health differences in American society, because in terms of the ratio of infection rate, hospitalization rate or dying from COVID-19 Twice the white American. The pushing hands behind these results include the same housing, employment and medical opportunities that cannot be obtained from white people. Recently published a comment article published in the ""American Medical Association magazine"" stating that these differences are the ""intention or unintentional results of decision -making"" in the United States. In the United States, the characteristics of the epidemic seriously affecting all have caused the accelerated spread of infectious diseases that can be prevented and treated. Thousands of American children, especially children with low -income families, cannot be vaccinated on time. With the overwhelming and lack of funds, medical institutions in various places have to distribute a large amount of resources from the treatment of COVID-19, and the incidence of sexual transmission diseases has reached the highest in the history of the United States. At the same time, the psychological health of American teenagers is particularly affected because many students cannot accept psychological health services provided by the school.  ""The health of Americans has been deteriorating over the years."" Woolf said, ""There are many reasons."" But it cannot be blamed only in the United States' dependence on expensive and exclusive private medical systems. It turns out that some basic concepts of the United States have also had problems. According to only one example, the US Constitution stipulates that states are responsible for the health of the local public, which has led to a variety of measures for states to respond to epidemic conditions. Culture and environment seem to exacerbate the impact of the epidemic. Compared with citizens in other countries, Americans are more likely to do behaviors that are regarded as risks by public health experts, such as having guns, smoking, too much eating, and less exercise. The polarization politics also makes it difficult for the United States to restrain these behaviors.  The Kaizawa Family Foundation conducted the vaccine tracking survey in January, and found that the proportion of the United States Republicans who vaccinated at least 1 dose of vaccine was less than 2/3; in contrast, this ratio of Democrats was as high as 91%. According to polls, the only consensus between the two parties seems to be how the epidemic causes them to exhaust their fears. This brings another mystery: As more and more epidemic prevention measures are canceled, Americans will face a virus that will still live with this kind of virus that will still cause long -term diseases. ""We are treating such acute diseases, rather than solving problems that can prevent this disease from the beginning.""

According to the report, from May 13th to 26th, 23 non -acne pop countries and regions have reported to WHOs 257 cases of diagnosis of diagnosis of acne, and about 120 suspected cases have been reported. No death cases have been reported. WHO added that as the scope of monitoring expands, more cases of acne will be found. In the context of COVID-19's popularity, the cross-border outbreak of monkey acne epidemic and the characteristics of high interpersonal communication have aroused widespread global attention.  Li Tai Sheng, director of the infection of Beijing Union Hospital, told the Global Times reporter on the 30th that this time, the acne has become popular in cross -contain, and the potential causes are more diverse. In addition to the influx of outbreaks in specific populations due to individual characteristics and behavioral models, and virus variations leading to enhanced infectious force, the immunity of the people's acne virus is reduced due to the ceiling vaccine. According to Li Taisheng, as the global ceiling vaccination plans have stopped, the people have not been inoculated in the past 40 years, and the specific immunity of the inoculation of the small ceiling vaccine people has gradually decreased over time, so the people of the monkey acne have continued to expand.  There are currently no reports of monkey acne in my country and have not detected monkey acne virus during wildlife or entry quarantine. Earlier, Tan Wenjie, chief scientist of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Control and Control and Control Institute, and the national key R & D project, ""Emphasized and Beasts Communication Cross -species infection and Communication Mechanism"" chief scientist, said in an interview with the media that my country has not reported to find monkey acne cases. There was no report that the virus was discovered in the animal host, so the current focus is on external prevention input.  According to Tan Wenjie, after the outbreak of monkey acne in the United States in 2003, in order to prevent the input of the epidemic, the former State of the State of the National Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine issued a notice to strictly quarantine the people from the epidemic area, and adopted the necessary prevention and control measures to the suspicious monkey acne patients, such as It is forbidden to enter the country where rodents and long animals from the epidemic areas may transmit monkey acne virus; strict quarantine inspection, health supervision, and necessary mouse treatment should be implemented for goods from the epidemic area. Therefore, the possibility of the animal acne from being carried by the entry passengers is not very likely. However, the port quarantine cannot be relaxed because of this, and strict quarantine quarantine should be strictly quarantined by the people, animals, transportation, containers, goods, and postal bags from the monkey acne.  Li Tai Sheng believes that with the restoration of global travel and trade, it does not rule out the possibility of input cases in my country, so the border quarantine must be strengthened and a standardized monitoring system must be formulated. ""Monkey acne is risky in close contact and high -risk population, but the risk of spreading general population is low, and the possibility of global popularity is extremely low.""  On May 30, the General Administration of Customs issued a notice saying that many countries in the world have recently reported to the case of monkey acne, and the national customs port health quarantine will continue to do a good job of ""multi -illness and prevention"" to prevent the epidemic from overlapping. It will strictly implement various sanitary quarantine measures such as health reporting; strengthen the entry carrying, delivery quarantine and rodent quarantine, strengthen multi -department joint prevention joint control, and strictly prevent the risk of input in the epidemic.  According to a reporter from the Global Times, at present, my country has established a variety of genetic testing technologies that can be used for early diagnosis of monkey acne, which can quickly achieve screening of monkey acne virus. Tan Wenjie said that, for example, the fluorescent quantitative real -time polymerase chain reaction detection technology can be made in 3 hours of acne virus within 3 hours. Combined with the new generation of sequencing methods, not only can the sample be identified within 24 hours whether the sample is monkey acne virus virus virus Or other acne virus (such as smallpox virus, beef acne virus, etc.), and the source of the monkey acne virus can be traced on the source and the transmission chain. In addition, Tan Wenjie also revealed that the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has formulated the ""Technical Plan for Monkey Acne Extraction Emergency Response"", reserving monkey acne molecular detection reagents and conducting PCR testing and training for diseased and control professionals in various provinces and cities.  Monkey acne virus nucleic acid testing kits (fluorescent PCR method) developed by Chinese Biotechnology Company, developed by diagnostic reagents, have recently obtained the EU CE access qualification. The company's relevant person in charge said in an interview with the Global Times reporter that the product will be listed and sold in 27 member states of the European Union and a country that recognizes the EU CE qualifications. At present, this product has received emergency orders from multiple countries, and nearly 100,000 reagents are about to be sent to more than 50 countries and regions around the world. At the same time, the product has also started registration applications in multiple monkey acne popular areas.  Another inspection kit research and development company Shengxiang Bio said to the Global Times reporter that at present, Spain, the UAE, South Africa and other countries have an order intention to detect monkey acne virus nucleic acid testing kits, and some countries have certain definitions. Order, the ordering kit is mainly used for emergency reserves.  Faced with antigenicity, biological characteristics, morphology, structure, etc., which is very similar to ceiling virus with smallpox virus, is it still effective in the past to deal with ceiling virus vaccines? According to Li Tai Sheng, the past studies have shown that the vaccination of smallpox vaccination has a protective effect of about 85%of the monkey acne. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration also approved the prevention of the third -generation high -poisoning small ceiling vaccine for adult ceiling and monkey acne. Tan Wenjie also believes that the similarity of ceiling viruses and monkey acne virus can form cross -immunity. Therefore, for people with high -infected risks or people entering areas, emergency vaccination can be carried out in time after judging risks. , You can provide millions of ceiling vaccine emergency vaccination at any time. ""  The President of the China Vaccine Industry Association, Feng Dujia, said in the inquiry of the Global Times reporter that it is not sure whether China will develop monkey acne vaccines, but if it is needed, it is not too difficult from a technical perspective. There is a year ago, and now it will only be more advanced. Whether it is necessary to develop research and development depends on the specific situation. ""  Jiang Chunlai, a professor at the School of Life Sciences at Jilin University, told the Global Times reporter that if necessary, it is now likely that China is more likely to restart vaccines for smallpox virus, rather than developing vaccines for monkey acne virus because of special development for monkey acne virus virus virus The vaccine takes longer and uncertain is large, so choosing a mature ceiling vaccine to prevent monkey acne is more feasible. Jiang Chunlai said that at present, the public does not have to worry too much about the epidemic of monkey acne. Ordinary people reduce gathering, wearing masks, and wash their hands frequently to avoid contact with wild animals and not eat raw meat, which can effectively reduce the risk of infection.",Monkey Poor Virus; ceiling vaccine;

Among them, nearly half of the confirmed cases appeared in Jical provinces in the Agricultural Zone in Yinan. Han Tochi, a health official in Jigal, said that the number of cases in the past few years can be counted, and the number of cases discovered this year is ""never seen before."" It is reported that in 2021, there were 16 confirmed cases of ""Congo fever"" in Jigal, of which 7 were died. This year, 43 cases have been found in the province so far, of which 8 of them died.  According to the WHO, the ""Congo Hot"" is a kind of intense infectious disease, which is mainly popular among countries in Africa, Balkans, the Middle East and Asia north latitude. The ""Congo"" virus is mainly infected with human beings through bite bites, and the blood and secretions of the infected person can cause interpersonal transmission. The virus has no vaccine at present, and the disease occurs quickly, which can cause severe bleeding in the inside and outside of the body, especially nasal hemorrhage, which causes a mortality between 10%and 40%.  According to the Iraqi News Agency, at present, the Iraqi Health Department has taken corresponding prevention and control measures to prevent large -scale disinfecting of animal houses to prevent further spread of the ""Congo's fever"" epidemic. As most cases occur in farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians, the Iraqi government suggested that the people should buy meat from the stores that meet the health standards.  The WHO on behalf of Ahamad Zoyten on behalf of Ailak's on behalf of Ahamad Zoyten, some of the reasons for the hemorrhage and thermal infusion were the warming of the global climate, which led to the proliferation of the breeding period of the tapeworm. In addition, due to the continuity of the COVID-19 epidemic, many livestock houses have not been disinfected and killed in time, which has also led to the raging of tapeworms.
