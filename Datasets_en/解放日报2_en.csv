""Enterprises hope to carry out normal production and operation activities as soon as possible under the premise of preventing epidemic prevention.""  At present, Shanghai is returning to normal production order. In this process, what are the problems that companies are facing? How to solve it? The reporter interviewed a number of members of the CPPCC from the corporate community.  Restore across province  For many companies, the smooth flow of logistics is one of the necessary prerequisites for production and operation. As the person in charge of the operator of the park, Zhao Lijia feels more profound. Some time ago, there was a company in the park that produced medical equipment to supply the house in the field. However, because the logistics was not through, this company could not get the goods and cannot produce it, and faced a breach of contract. In the end, the park helped to contact a familiar logistics company to temporarily solve the problem of supply, but the phenomenon of default caused by similar reasons was not a minority.

After all the loading was completed, the car transported the goods to the logistics company's transit stations in the city for centralized disinfecting, and then immediately set off to Shanghai Sanlihui Motor Component Co., Ltd.  These small trucks come from different Suzhou companies. During the epidemic, although Sanlihui Zhong was in a closed production and there were still many orders, the overall number decreased sharply, and the premium prevention and control policies in Suzhou were very strict, resulting in the increase in logistics transportation costs. In order to solve the problem of upstream supply, Lai Yingbiao, Minister of Sanlihuizhong Procurement Department, thought that the vegetable group purchase in the community could share the transportation costs. Under the inspiration of vegetable group purchases, Lai Yingbiao and the company discussed and used their factory as the transportation point, and arranged for 5 companies around them to focus on the goods and send them together to Shanghai. Everyone has developed a method for distributed transportation fees: In principle, the supplier shall pay the freight in accordance with the supply ratio. Some companies with less supply can be exempted from the shipping charges, and some subsidies will be given by Sanli Huizhong. In this way, not only the small enterprises were able to ship profit, but the large enterprises also greatly reduced transportation costs, and Sanli Huizhong also used this to clear the supply channels in Suzhou.  Vegetable group purchase also gives another revelation that both sides of the supply and demand can directly connect and accurately match. In Suzhou, such a direct supply and demand model appears in the epidemic crisis. In late April, the Suzhou Industry and Information Bureau announced that the ""Su Liantong"" platform was launched after being tested. The platform was supported by Suzhou Telecom technology to quickly connect the most suitable local suppliers for enterprises to solve the manufacturing industry in the region The needs of the original accessories and auxiliary materials of the enterprise, and the problems of the needs of the enterprise, and reduce the impact of the epidemic on the enterprise. At present, the ""Su Lingtong"" platform has accumulated more than 3,000 visits, more than 6,000 registered users, nearly 20,000 supply and demand information, and assisted in the formation of more than 10,000 supply and demand docking intentions. By May 22, with the help of the ""Su Lingtong"" platform, all industrial enterprises in Suzhou's 12,487 regulations have resumed normal production, of which 80%of the company's production rate accounts for 84.3%.  According to the Suzhou Industrial and Information Bureau's plan, the ""Su Lingtong"" born under the epidemic will be operated for a long time. ""If you can make a platform covering the Yangtze River Delta, it will be a very meaningful thing."" Some people in the industry proposed such an idea.  Building an industrial chain co -operating mechanism covering the Yangtze River Delta may not be just an idea. In the recently released ""Shanghai Municipality Accelerating Economic Recovery and Revitalization Action Plan"", it focuses on the ""Establishing Mutual Protection Mechanism for the Establishment of the Yangtze River Delta Industry Chain Supply Chain"". With the point with the chain, the upstream and downstream enterprises of the industrial chain supply chain are resumed, and the company's production rate is steadily increased ... Establish the Yangtze River Delta industrial chain supply chain mutual guarantee mechanism to jointly ensure the strong chain.  The epidemic is a crisis, but from another perspective, more important opportunities are often contained behind the crisis. As one of the areas with the most active economic development, the highest degree of openness, and the strongest innovation capabilities in my country, the Yangtze River Delta is already a community of destiny.

From the perspective of takeaway platforms, in addition to the ""guarantee products"" of traditional concepts such as box lunch, Chinese snacks, bread cakes, etc., coffee, milk tea, desserts and other products that can add some flavor to life have also been launched one after another.  Some netizens have suggested why some familiar tastes are not fully returning? For example, some chain restaurants currently only restore 1/10 stores, and some brands only provide group purchases or packages and do not provide single products. In this regard, many merchants said that the implementation of epidemic prevention measures and ensuring food safety is the prerequisite for re -commercial and resumption. It is better to restore the business to be slower, and it is necessary to ensure quality and safety.  The change of a cup of current tea  The footsteps of Shanghai Fuxing Fu City can be seen from a cup of milk tea. According to the statistics of Meituan, Hungry, etc., in the past two weeks, more and more shops such as milk tea are provided. ""Various small materials"". Naixue's tea and like tea and other stores with tea chain brands have also resumed business. Consumers can directly place orders through brand mini -programs. The sales methods, product types, and distribution efficiency of these brands are changing.  ""In early May, Naixue's tea only provided the"" Guaranteed Package ""composed of bread. Five sets of sale were sold. The order was placed before 18:00 on the same day. Tea -making, coffee, bread, etc. are an important part of life. Before, the ""head of the group"" tried to find a qualified supplier and occasionally it could be a group; now, you can place an order directly through the brand applet before the epidemic. Although it is necessary to organize a group, the threshold is not high. In addition, the brand's direct supply, the quality is more secure. ""  Some consumers have suggested why these merchants who resumed their business still receive orders by set meals and group purchase. Can't they support personalized choices as before the epidemic occurred? The relevant person in charge of Xicha said that the main reason is to implement epidemic prevention measures. At present, more than 20 stores in the city have re -business. Before recovering, they must completely eliminate the stores and then implement the prevention measures of resumed employees. ""Employees have implemented closed -loop management. There are also fewer types of product types, mainly based on the set meal of current beverages and pastries. "" The community concentration order is used to improve efficiency.  Food safety is ""red line""  In addition to implementing epidemic prevention measures, food safety cannot be ignored. Judging from the recent notification of market supervision departments, some manufacturers have irregular practices in the resumed market. Among the exposed companies, there are both chain brands such as Manner Coffee and Internet celebrity brands such as Guanglian Shen. Investigation. It can be said that food safety is a ""red line"", and any risk is zero tolerance. In this regard, related companies should strictly control, and consumers must also keep their eyes.  ""We gradually increase prefabricated dishes and baking products according to the situation of resumption of work and re -production. Although there are still differences before the variety and epidemic, they are much richer than in early April and May. I hope consumers can understand."" Ding Dong bought vegetables. Relevant persons in charge said that recently, bread products and crayfish prefimmed dishes on the platform are selling well. ""This type of product has higher requirements for food safety, and the category must be gradually increased when ensuring food safety."" Take crayfish as an example. Last year, the platform launched a fried crayfish. This year, I launched live shrimp. Recently, I have launched freezing prefabricated dishes that need to be heated and cold food that can be directly eaten. The reason why there is such a change is that considering the current production and transportation conditions, ""taking freezing as an example, some consumers may feel that freezing and heating, and the taste is worse than the current production. Fresh technology can restore the existing taste to the maximum after heating. This is the current situation, taking into account the choice of safety and deliciousness. ""  The prefabricated dishes, semi -finished products, and Chinese and Western dim sums of the box are also increasing. For example, crayfish, dumplings, cakes, and large red intestines are all recent hot -selling products. However, compared with the epidemic, some of the current products of their own brands have not been launched. Relevant sources said that food safety should be placed first, because the production and transportation conditions of current products are even more harsh.  There are also consumers who appear to say that it is recommended to choose a product priority to choose big platforms and brands, and notice the packaging situation during the goods. Miss Wang Tea enthusiasts said that before the community group purchased milk tea from a small shop, some residents had discomfort after drinking. ""This is related to our own review. . As a result, there are no brands, no signs, and no production time on the milk tea packaging. ""She feels that there are more and more brands in the recovery and resumptions at the moment.  Mr. Zhu, a practitioner of the food industry, suggested that consumers should pay attention to the packaging of imported foods from non -name -entry food when shopping and takeaway. ""For example, some companies provide fresh products and imported foods that need cooking. The packaging of the two should be separated independently. Even if there are packaging, such as milk, cola, etc., it should be packaged. If you put it with vegetables, clean it with flowing water. Wipe it with the conditions to open it or eat it.

From 17:00 to 22, three shots were on duty at the gate of the community. There are also residents who are responsible for disinfection, medicine, and organizational nucleic acid, and young people who join later are responsible for arranging group purchase for everyone. In early April, the members of the Autonomous Guardian team increased from the initial eight elderly residents to nearly 20 people, covering veteran party members, in -service party members, and enthusiastic residents.  ""Old Land"" guardians in their hearts  ""I have worked in Wei Music Park for more than 30 years, and later I have moved here. I have lived here for more than 20 years. It can be said that it is the 'old land' here."" Yu Jing has lived in the Tai'an residential area for nearly 50 years. For decades, the elderly such as Gold Caizhen, Xia Huizhen, and Queen's Decer have joined the Guardian Guardian of the Guardian Park. The oldest 74 -year -old and the youngest are nearly 60 years old. Guarding the homeland is of more profound significance for these elderly people.  During the epidemic, the daily garbage clearance is not as convenient on weekdays, and Lao Nongtang is easy to breed insect pests. Therefore, people need to drag the trash can outside the community early in the morning to facilitate the clearing of sanitation vehicles. The old party member's virtue took the initiative to take on this task. Every day from morning to night, he dragged dry and wet trash cans to the mouth in turn, and was neatly placed back to the community. After persisting for more than a month, Queen's body began to be unreasonable. Although he still wants to continue to serve everyone, residents and volunteers have persuaded him to stop working as soon as possible to raise diseases.  Those who took over the garbage clearance baton were the old party members Jin Caizhen and the oldest volunteer Xia Huizhen. Nowadays, less than 5:30 every day, they will get up early and start busy in the hall. Clean the leaves, put the heavy trash can neatly, clean the dead ends, and push the full trash can to the gate of the community. The arrival of the early morning sanitation vehicle.  Young people are also trying to play their role. The enthusiastic young tenants in the community actively register as the ""head of the group"" to contact the supplier, send the dragon link, check the goods information, and establish the material distribution team for the residents. ""These young"" group leaders 'can help everyone find a fair price group purchase, and will also ask the old people in advance to eat food that the elderly like to eat, help the elderly in the community' ""group"", we also re -understand these young people. ""Yu Jing said Essence  Challenge of aging communities  Mao Jing came to work in the Tai'an residential area in August 2020, and one year later he served as secretary of the residential area. He took over in the epidemic and faced the test of this round of epidemic, so that the 34 -year -old young secretary grew rapidly.  ""A old house, more than 20 people who live in more than 20 people, and fewer ones have to live in more than a dozen people. Each time you make nucleic acids, send antigens, eliminate disinfecting, and send supplies, you must strive to avoid mutual contact between residents."" Mao Mao Mao Speak quietly. At this time, the spontaneous formation of the autonomous guardian team for residential areas such as Weiyuan Park plays a very important role in the order maintenance and orderly entry and exit of the order of Lao Luntang.  The aging problem of the residential area of Shanghai is increasingly prominent, and a lot of the epidemic has been revealed. In the next normalization prevention and control stage, in -service residents must return to work, and the number of volunteers in the community has dropped sharply. How to maintain daily epidemic prevention and control also tests the ability and wisdom of community cadres.  In the early days of the establishment of the Guardian Guardian Guardian, an elderly man with a fracture of the arm still insisted on distributing materials for the residents. A box of dishes were placed on the small cart, and the elderly slowly pushed downstairs in the residents' house with one hand. This moved the residents and was a little worried. Although the subsequent young delivery volunteers immediately ""replenished"", the aging community did face the problem of insufficient volunteer service capabilities. In Mao Jing's view, a model like the Guardian Guardian Guardian team can explore normal promotion.  ""But the premise is to recruit more"" young people ""in the community and volunteers who have the energy to invest in the daily work of the community.""  The ideas of the two new and old residential areas coincide. When asked how to look at many neighborhoods in Shanghai in this epidemic, Yu Jing said that the epidemic situation is good, and other ""special circumstances"" are good. In the final analysis, the residents are to launch the residents. Only everyone starts, and the victory will come.",Waste bin; residential area; elderly residents; sanitation vehicles; Changning District; garbage clearance;,

The reporter interviewed Zheng Junhua, the chief commander of the New International Expo Center's square cabin hospital and the party secretary of the Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Prevention and control has brought many new thinking.  Pay attention to the prevention and control of key places  From the leading of the Renji Hospital Medical Team on March 25th to the Expo Exhibition Center Hospital to this day, Zheng Junhua has spent 2 months at the square cabin hospital. ""My deepest feeling is that the overall treatment work continues to be steady and good. The"" person and other beds' in the early stages of outbreak became a 'bed and other people' last month; for example, the cumulative treatment of the new country Bo Fang Card Hospital was taken as an example. Of the more than 10,000 patients, more than 300 people were referred to the designated hospitals. Under the principles of ""early warning, early recognition, early diagnosis, early treatment, and early transfer ', the goal of reducing the mortality of the disease and increasing the cure rate was achieved.""  Zheng Junhua revealed that after the merger of the seller and designated hospitals, he will also lead the medical team until mid -June to complete the treatment of the existing patients, and also prepare for the possible local sporadic rebounds. ""The high propagation of Omikon's mutation plant will inevitably challenge the advancement of resumption of work and re -school, especially the farmers' market, old residential areas, 'city villages', supermarkets with concentrated flow of people, pension rehabilitation institutions, universities, etc. Places with dense personnel and difficult prevention and control must be taken seriously. ""  The elderly vaccinate the vaccine as soon as possible  Zheng Junhua believes that the virus may have the possibility of hidden transmission. Once new and new situations occur again, there must be a fast response plan to quickly improve, improve monitoring and early warning capabilities, and make good use of new methods such as ""detection whistle"" and ""electronic whistle"". Essence ""With the successive put of the normalization of nucleic acid samples in this city, and the extensive rolling of the 'venue code', a group of optimized equipment and processes are constantly building an epidemic prevention and control network. String, responsible for the health of yourself and others. ""  He particularly mentioned that insisting on the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it is inseparable from the joint efforts of every ""first responsible person in health"". ""Residents of the district community must not be taken lightly."" Zheng Junhua said that when the ""three-piece set"" and ""five more"" were kept in mind, they also encouraged the elderly who were in accordance with the conditions to inoculate the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible.  ""This round of the Shanghai epidemic has more than 620,000 infected people. Although the study of the academic community on the Omircor's mutation strains is still underway, it is not difficult to find that it is more aggressive for the elderly and low immunity."" At present, there are nearly 6 million elderly people over 60 years old in this city. ""In designated hospitals such as Renjinan Hospital, elderly patients who have vaccinated 3 doses or 2 doses of vaccine switch to the probability of severe illness and critical illness. Those. If there is no contraindication, out of consideration of themselves, I also hope that more elderly people can go to the vaccine vaccination point nearby and add a layer of protection to themselves. ""  Medical institutions need to do a good job of three major constructions  ""This epidemic is a big test for Shanghai, and it has a"" disease ""."" Zheng Junhua said that for medical institutions, how to ""three prongs"" in normalized prevention and control -further strengthening Basic medical services, response to the sense of hospital's sense of hospital, and treating critical condition for critical illness require everyone's experience and wisdom. ""Is there a medical service for the hospitals to undertake personnel in high -risk areas? How to arrange for the treatment of nucleic acid abnormal people in daily diagnosis and treatment? How can Internet hospitals fully do a good job of special diseases, expert outpatients, and multidisciplinary consultations? Citizens? This requires a full plan. ""  In Zheng Junhua's view, strengthening the supporting construction of large hospitals needs to fully consider the construction of infrastructure, related supporting facilities and mobile facilities, and meet the physical space layout, flow lines, and hospital feelings required for hospitals to respond to emergencies. ""Both the battle can be used"", which can quickly perform functional conversion.  The first is to strengthen the construction of emergency department. ""The hospital should increase investment in funding, summarize the experience of this round of epidemic, carry out scientific and reasonable transformation, set up the inlet and exit channels that meet the requirements of the hospital, and set up emergency observation areas, isolation areas, negative pressure rooms, and mobile medical units. Wait, create the necessary safety protection barriers and measures, and accelerate the section, screening, isolation, and transportation. ""  The second is to strengthen the construction of intensive medical department. ""There must be a unified allocated medicine, protection, technical human resources, and building space that meets or can quickly transform into the requirements of infectious disease prevention. Usually cooperate with various specialists to do a good job of centralized management, and as a platform for concentrated multidisciplinary treatment during war, Microcate classification and use of severe diagnosis and treatment resources to improve the efficiency of rescue. ""  The third is to plan the construction of the new court area. ""In the new hospital, the overall plan should include the setting of emergency and popular rib clinics, partitions and integrity of medical functions, and the setting of the transportation system. Building should consider patients and medical staff streamlined independent, 'three districts, two channels' settings' settings. Wait, we must also consider that the single -family building can be quickly converted into guarantee houses, such as dormitory buildings, etc., reflecting actual needs and flexibility. ""  ""Medical teams across the country to support Shanghai, let us feel particularly warm; but at the same time, we must also grow up in setbacks, accumulate experience to promote the prevention and control capabilities in the future, strengthen the foundation, and let the 'restart' The city is getting better and better.

According to the announcement, the forthcoming rice dumplings and rice are supplied by Shanghai Cuihu Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.; the vegetable bag is provided by Shanghai Chaosheng Food Co., Ltd. According to public information, Chaosheng Company is a new company registered on May 17 this year. Netizens asked, so why can this new company be a confession unit?  Yesterday, Gaojing Town released the situation, saying that Chao Sheng Company's recommendation from the Cuihu Company that had previously completed 3 rounds of supply, complete qualifications, and video inspected the company's vegetable supply capacity and agreed to accept the vegetable supply business.  For this explanation, some citizens sort out four questions:  First, why did Gaojing Town choose Cuihu Company and Chaosheng, not well -known enterprises or platforms?  Second, what is the relationship between Cuihu Company and Chaosheng? Why recommend Chaosheng Company?  Third, from the public information, what is the reason why the shareholders of Chaosheng set up a number of companies in a short time?  Fourth, neither Cuihu Company and Chaosheng Company cannot inquire about the ""Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control Living Material Guarantee Enterprise Inquiry Library"" to participate in the guarantee work?  In response, the reporter contacted the Gaojing Town Government, Cuoli Company, and Chaosheng Company. The relevant leaders gave positive responses and expressed their hope to respond to citizen concerns with actual actions and products.  Vegetable package first check the goods before settlement  Chen Yijie, the deputy mayor of Gaojing Town, said that after many comparisons in the early stage of the town, the Cuoli Company was determined as a supplier for supplying supplies. It is low, and it takes about a week to complete the delivery of the entire town, which will give some opinions from some residents who get materials late. "" Cuihu Company has a strong stocking capacity. ""The town has brand requirements for the supplies, and it can basically meet.""  At the end of April and May, Cuoli Company purchased 3 supply supplies for Gaojing Town, about 60,000 copies each time. From the perspective of material quality and logistics accuracy, Cuhu company can implement strictly in accordance with the contract, and residents generally recognize it. Therefore, the town hopes that the new round of guarantee supplies will still be purchased by Cuhu.  In response to the supply of a new round of material, Gaojing Town proposes the request of updating vegetable varieties to Cuoli Company based on residents' feedback. Cuoli Company stated that the stock preparation pressure in the short term is greater. According to its previous cooperation experience, it is recommended to the town to purchase this vegetable bag to purchase this vegetable bag. Since then, Cuihu Company has issued a letter of commitment to Gaoying Town, and is willing to provide guarantees for the quality of vegetables purchased by Chao Sheng Company.  The Gaojing Town Insurance Working Group, together with the township market supervision office, conducted a qualification review of Chaosheng Company. Judging from the results of the review, the company applied for registration to the Garden District 669 of Tinglin Town, Jinshan District on March 22 this year. Affected by the epidemic, it was approved by the Jinshan District Market Supervision Bureau on May 17th. The business scope includes the wholesale of edible agricultural products, which meets the conditions of suppliers as suppliers for supply supplies.  In terms of the quality of vegetables, the Gaojing Town Baofeng Working Team made two requirements to Chaosheng Company: trading according to the ""first inspection, then settlement"", that is, the vegetable gift package was issued to the residents and the payment was approved before settlement the payment. This was recognized by Chaosheng Company; on May 22, the vegetable package and supply base purchased by Chao Sheng Company through a video connection. ""According to the plan, more than 60,000 vegetable gift packs purchased this time will be delivered to Baoshan with a logistics vehicle with a qualified qualifications in 3 days. The first batch is planned to be sent to Shanghai on the evening of May 23. The quality of supplies of supplies is what we care about most. Everyone hopes that the materials are purchased and distributed well. ""Chen Yijie said.  Hope to prove yourself with the quality of the material  The relevant person in charge of Cuoli Company said that Chaosheng is indeed newly registered, but Chang Yanqing, the shareholder of Cuhu and Chao Sheng Company, is not the first time that her other company has purchased goods from us several times. The other party has high requirements for product quality, clear accounts, and good performance, so we recommend that Gaojing Town Government can invite her to participate in the purchase. After they reach cooperation, we will have the quality guarantee of the dishes. "" Chang Yanqing used Chao Sheng as a supplier of this provision of this provider because Chaosheng completed the filing of food operation and meets the requirements of supplier.  This was also recognized by Chang Yanqing. She said that companies that have cooperated with Cuoli Company were registered in April 2015 and engaged in general trade transactions, including non -staple foods. Based on the business development of these years, the old company wants to register several new companies, so it submitted a registration application in March of this year, including Chaosheng Company, ""One of the main purpose of establishing Chao Sheng Company is to obtain a food business license to facilitate engaging in engaging in engaging Food operation. There are also several companies who apply for the business to expand their business. Because of the epidemic, the approval procedures for these companies will not be completed until late April and mid -May. There are these new companies. ""  Considering the ability of vegetable procurement and Chao Sheng Company to have food business qualifications, Chang Yanqing signed a cooperation agreement with the Gaojing Town Government in the name of Chao Sheng Company. I did not expect that netizens were questioned because of the establishment time of the new company.  She introduced that the supplier of the vegetable gift package comes from Shandong, and there are production bases in Shandong and Jiangsu. The actual shipment of the gift package is in Changzhou. The lonely old man and the elderly who live alone have donated two batches of vegetables, all purchased from them, and the quality and price of the dishes are more reasonable. This time, according to the requirements of Gaojing Town, they purchased vegetables from Gaojing Town. ""Facing online attention, she hopes to use it to use it. Vegetable quality to prove itself and accept citizens' supervision.  Procurement of supply supplies must be more transparent  From the inspection, Cuihu and Chaosheng Company are not in the ""Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control Library Inquiry Library"", but the authoritative department said that this is not to say that related companies cannot purchase supplies. According to relevant regulations, when the government's procurement package is issued to residents, suppliers with corresponding business compliance should be selected. Enterprises, but there are no mandatory requirements. However, the purchaser must strictly control the supply, and the problem needs to be tracked.  From the current survey, Cuhuang Company and Chaosheng Company supply to Gaojing Town to provide a gift package for Gaojing Town, and there is no qualification problem. At present, it is important to pay attention to whether the materials provided by related companies are reliable.  It should be noted that the material insurance supply in Gaojing Town will attract attention, which is related to the opaque purchase of some streets and towns during the epidemic. The supplies and units involved in those problems are urgently needed to investigate in -depth investigations, give results as soon as possible, and deal with it in accordance with the law. Only when the information is open and transparent, it will not make people suspect.  Netizens hope to keep for good things and do well  The reporter noticed that most netizens expressed their understanding to the response of Gaojing Town. Residents who have received related materials said that the quality of new rice and rice dumplings is good.  Some netizens said that all the ""century -old shops"" started from the ""newcomer"" and developed a little bit. As long as the operators abide by the law, the quality of materials is excellent. Some netizens said that it is a good thing to pay attention to the qualifications of suppliers. It can urge government departments to do well in guaranteeing good things.  Since April, Shanghai has continuously strengthened its supervision of supplies. On April 23, the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters Living Material Guarantee Course (Shanghai Commercial Commission) issued the ""Notice on Further Strengthening the Management of Life Materials for Further Enhancement of Government"", requiring the commercial departments of all districts The material guarantee gift package is remedied, the review of the supplier's qualifications is strengthened, and the varieties of the provision of gift packages are controlled.

Okay time to return to Shanghai, buy tickets on your mobile phone as soon as possible. Xiao Xiao's home is near Xinjiang Bay City Station on Line 10. ""It is cheap and easy to take the subway. There are not many people in the carriage. The experience is much better than expected.""

Backpack carrying a drum -drum bag, a tie box in my hand, Lao Lan looked up and looked at the notice carefully, confirming that this was the subway to the direction of Pudong. Essence In February this year, he invited his relatives to return home. He planned to accompany his family and return again in March. Unexpectedly, the epidemic in Shanghai later had to stay in his hometown in Jiangxi.  ""A few days ago, the boss contacted me and said that the factory plans to resume work on June 1st. Can you come back?"" From that day, Lao Lan has been paying attention to the situation in Shanghai. Later, he immediately purchased the high -speed rail ticket of the day.

She decided to choose ""Metro+Bus ""Plan. ""I am going to take Line 10 to Hongqiao Road Station and transfer to Line 3, take the Shanghai Railway Station, and then take the bus to Zhoupu.""  Mr. Huang: I have confidence in Shanghai  ""I was traveling on a business trip before, and returned to Shanghai today."" Unlike other passengers who returned to Shanghai with many luggage, when the reporter saw Mr. Huang, he only took a small bag with him. He was engaged in the financial industry, and he went to Fujian on a business trip at the beginning of the year. He originally planned to return to Shanghai in March. He did not expect that the epidemic disrupted the rhythm. He decided to stay in the local area and return to Shanghai after the situation improved. ""We are all following the project, often traveling on a business trip, and sometimes it is inevitable to stay in the field for a long time, and we are used to it.""  Mr. Huang told reporters that he had just moved to Shanghai from other places this year. Recently, seeing that the various urban functions of Shanghai are gradually recovering, he believes that the time node is more suitable for returning to Shanghai. ""You see a signal of several subway lines today!""  ""I have confidence in Shanghai.""

The comprehensive victory of the Shanghai Defense War.  In the afternoon, Gong Zheng and his party came to Ziguang Hongmao Microelectronics Company of Qingpu District to learn more about the company's measures to prevent and control the epidemic and control the production operation in detail. Since the epidemic, the enterprise has achieved zero infection and 100%operating rate. Gong Zheng encouraged enterprises to summarize the near -stage epidemic prevention practices, form an effective system for preventing epidemic prevention management in large enterprises, and better guarantee production and operation under normalized epidemic prevention and control. Nanjing Park Community has maintained a ""epidemic district"" for 33 consecutive days. Gong Zheng listened to the introduction of community epidemic prevention and residential service measures, requiring to further improve the normalization prevention and control mechanism of the community. Essence The city leaders also came to Qinghu Road to check the opening of shops along the street. In vegetable farms, fruit shops, barber shops, and laundry shops, citizens do personal protection, scan the code to enter, and take their own needs. Gong Zheng said that the prevention zone should be liberalized in an orderly manner to enhance the confidence of residents' victory over the epidemic. It is necessary to reasonably arrange residents to travel in batches, deploy places code and ""digital sentry"" in public places, and implement measures such as temperature measurement, code scanning, and maintaining social distance.  Gong Zheng pointed out that we must go all out to do a good job of reducing new and anti -bullets, focus on energy, maintain concentration, and respond to uncertainty risks with meticulous certainty measures, and lay the foundation for orderly restoring the normal operation of cities. The city should strengthen the tackling of the immune -related areas, strengthen the ""four should be four"", do not fall into one household, do not miss one person, and speed up the clearing. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate various risks and hidden dangers in normalized prevention and control, continuously improve the ability of emergency response to emergency response, and keep the bottom line of preventing the epidemic from rebounding. It is necessary to accelerate the orderly liberalization, limited flow, and effective control of the prevention zone, move forward in exploration, improve in practice, and prevent simplification and one -size -fits -all.

Recently, the 1.34 million ""life -saving wafers"" imported from Japan from Japan arrived at Pudong Airport. Benefiting from the Yangtze River Delta Wulian guarantee for joint announcements, the wafer was quickly released. It will provide semiconductor companies such as Shanghai Well, Nanxin, Ziguang Zhanrui to ensure that these companies are delivered on schedule for downstream customers such as Huawei and Xiaomi.  Such a ""life and death supply chain"" is just a drop in the sea of the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Supply Chain.  Closed -loop production, chip people defend the industry  Chip is the core component of technology products such as automobiles and mobile phones. The entire Yangtze River Delta industrial chain is highly synergistic. Any ring stop will have a negative impact on downstream. Therefore, even in the most severe period of the Shanghai epidemic situation, integrated circuit manufacturing companies are still ""core"". Among the two batch of more than 1,800 key enterprises ""Whitening"", more than 210 integrated circuit companies. In fact, the vast majority of these companies have never discontinued production, and thanks to the ""white list"", more key job employees who control at home can return to the closed -loop production. Therefore, the Zhangjiang Factory of Hualang Group, a 100 -meter passage for guests to visit in the past, has now become one of the temporary sleeping shops of closed production employees, and it has also become the first scene for chip people to defend the industry.  However, in order to ensure continuous production, in addition to employees retrograde, equipment raw materials are required to be continuously confession. At present, leading companies such as SMIC, Huahi, TSMC, and Jita have achieved 90%or even full load production, relying on the continuous supply chain companies behind the supply chain company.  The Hongming supply chain registered in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone is the confession of the integrated circuit industry in Shanghai and the country. Since Shanghai Fengsong, some employees of Hongming's supply chain simply stayed at the important customer business site to ensure the circulation of documents for important materials; some employees retrograde overnight to the warehouse to coordinate logistics in and out; and the hard work of crossing provincial truck drivers. Facing the strict inspection of Shanghai vehicles in various places, they sealed themselves in the cockpit for 20 hours.  At the end of April, the four companies of Hongming and their subordinates were approved by the Municipal Economic and Information Commission, the second batch of key enterprises ""whitewashing"" and the key foreign trade enterprises ""whitelist"" of key foreign trade enterprises in the Municipal Commerce Commission. Persons such as the team leader and other key positions returned to the job. Shen Yan, managing director of Hongming Supply Chain, revealed that so far at the end of March, more than 2,000 goods have been imported, and more than 1,600 batches of goods are urgently needed in the delivery industry.  No one is bystander on the confession chain  Finding certainty in various uncertainty and becoming the ""living method"" of the Shanghai integrated circuit industry. Among them, the ""group buying machine"" is a kind of emergency student wisdom. Affected by the global epidemic, Shanghai international flights, especially cold chain flights, have been greatly reduced, and are extremely unstable, which leads to the bottom of the key raw material inventory of the corporate materials that highly depend on cold chain transportation such as photoresmal glue and anti -reflective film generating solution. At a critical moment, the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Association once again shot. With the support of the Municipal Economic and Information Commission, Shanghai Customs, Airlines, and Hongming Supply Chain Design, open the charter mode. From April this year, the Shanghai Port has 8 to 10 tons of light -engraved glue and other raw materials every week to enter the country with aviation panels, commercial charter machines, etc., which greatly guarantees the safety inventory of local and peripheral chip companies. 70%of integrated circuit chemicals raw materials imported ports.  No one is bystander in the confession chain. Production and supply chain enterprises do their best to import, import, and grab the cabin; government departments are urgent to open the ""whitelist"" guarantee personnel return to the maximum extent; In a large amount of backlog of goods, the ""sea fishing"" is reduced, reducing retention and accelerating release. Gao Jing told reporters that the wafer is very delicate and must be dismantled in a dust -free environment with a humidity from 40 degrees to 60 degrees to 60 degrees and a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius to 26 degrees Celsius. In the past, due to the restrictions on the port conditions, Jiasheng semiconductor was basically scrapped after being inspected by the hits. ""According to the average monthly import of 1200 votes and 1%hit inspection rate, we will lose hundreds of thousands of dollars due to no reason for inspection every year."" Fortunately, according to the five of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Hefei, Customs jointly issued a joint announcement of the safe and smooth supply chain of the Yangtze River Delta Industry Chain, which will be implemented by the Customs of the Yangtze River Delta. Jiasheng semiconductor has recently imported a wafer wafer. At the port customs, Pudong Airport Customs only conducts the appearance of the goods, the seal, and the label. The inspection of the inner field of the dust and constant humidity warehouse is inspected to maximize the efficiency of customs clearance and reduce the loss of goods. On May 14th, in the Gaoqiao Port District of Shanghai, a high -precision semiconductor equipment with a vote value of more than 40 million yuan imported by Jiejie Microelectronics (Nantong) Technology Co., Ltd. also passed the ""Portal Appearance Inspection+Comprehensive Disposal of Destination"" The two -stage process completed the import customs clearance. It is reported that since April, Shanghai Customs has relying on the long triangle integrated distribution control and inspection coordinated mechanism. It has paid 19 batches of goods in integrated circuits, with a value of 141 million yuan.  Shanghai Port, the hub is still. On April 25th, Ansonmei Semiconductor, the world's top ten automotive semiconductor suppliers in the world, officially resumed the Global Dialing Center in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone. The first all -intelligent all -weather semiconductor global distribution center ""Kintera International"", located in the Pudong Airport Comprehensive Insurance Zone, has maintained its operation since Shanghai Fengram. Wei Xiugang, the person in charge of Kintera International, revealed that since March 28, there are 4,151 votes in Kintera International's entry and exit area. The Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Association has recently completed the report of the third batch of ""white list"" enterprises in the industry. Guo Yiwu, the secretary -general of the association, said: ""We have reported more than 100, compared to the first two batches of manufacturing companies, these batch are mostly integrated circuit design companies.

On May 17, 96 new COVID-19 local diagnosis cases and 759 were asymptomatic infected by the soil. Of the 96 cases of confirmation of the soil, 40 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 56 cases were asymptomatic infected with confirmed cases. 759 cases of non -symptoms of the soil were found in closed -loop isolation control. As of 24:00 on May 17, there were 218 heavy patients who received treatment at designated medical institutions and 63 dangerous types. On May 17, 3 cases of new local deaths were added; 274 were discharged from the city's local confirmed cases, and 3,336 cases of centralized isolation medical observations were lifted.  Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Municipal Health and Health Commission, introduced that the city is currently in the stage of consolidating the results of the Zero-Covid attack, and the pressure of ""newly increased and rebounding"" is still great. If there is a sporadic positive infection, it is necessary to strictly grasp the prevention and control of the epidemic, do a good job of epidemiological survey, and carry out emergency response work.  The first is to highlight the word ""fast"". Once a positive infection appears in the society, you must insist on quickly, coordinate and coordinate the ""city -district -community"" three -level streaming team. ""The work requirements, that is, the flow team arrived at the scene in 2 hours, completed the core information survey of the flow tone in 4 hours, and initially found the basic situation and completed the flow report for 24 hours.  The second is to achieve a ""quasi"".

""  The third is to implement a word ""tube"". Strictly fall into various control measures, first of all, ""should be turned around"", and after discovering those who are positive infected, they will contact the municipal and district transfer departments as soon as possible. Under the premise of ensuring safety, they will complete the positive. Transfer work. For those who have been investigated and determined, they should be ""separated by, and they should be separated by fast"" to maximize the risk of communication. Risk investigation and control are carried out in time for important places or key areas involved. At the same time, combined with environmental testing and laboratory virus gene sequencing, do a good job of traceability of the epidemic.  According to Liu Bo, deputy customs chief of Shanghai Customs, since late April, the total value of freight volume and foreign trade imports and exports in Shanghai has gradually stabilized and gradually recovered. Shanghai Customs will make every effort to promote the efficient implementation of 10 measures to promote the preservation of foreign trade and stability. At the same time, combined with Shanghai's actual situation, it has studied and introduced a new one Rotation support enterprises to expand the re -production and re -production and ensure the safety and stability of the supply chain of the industrial chain, promote the re -production and production of the enterprise, and promote the core function of the port.

The ship is the first ship delivered from Jiangnan Shipbuilding since its gradual resumption of labor on April 23, and the first ship delivered by the entire Shanghai shipbuilding industry since the epidemic in March this year.  This type of ship belongs to the ""PANDA (Panda)"" series of Jiangnan, which serves long -distance transportation of liquefied ethane and is generally applicable to the global major liquefied gas terminals.  According to the person in charge of Jiangnan Shipbuilding, the construction of this type of ship is complicated, the construction of itself is more difficult, and the cycle is tense. The outbreak of the epidemic in March has a great impact on production and delivery. With the efforts of the construction team, the ship was tried on March 8. During the trial flight, the team set up the epidemic prevention and disinfecting group, communication group, emergency rescue group, equipment repair group, logistics support group to comprehensively guarantee personnel safety and normal operation of the ship system. Since then, the trial personnel and shipowner crew, ship inspection, and service providers strictly adhere to epidemic prevention policies, overcome difficulties, and live on board.

However, some citizens were surprised to discover that there were trains drive from time to time on the shutdown route. Someone took a video from the window to the Internet, and several times formed a hot topic of discussion among netizens.  ""I heard the sound of the empty car of Line 9!"" Someone said.  ""Is the subway going to open immediately?"" Someone asked.  Some people also called: ""Come back! I want to listen to the newspaper.""  The subway pinned the expectations of citizens to normal urban life. However, the restart of the subway as ""news"" by ordinary people is actually a beautiful misunderstanding for the industry: although during the epidemic, although the Shanghai Metro has never really stopped, the entire network equipment is debugging every day to debugging ,test. In their own words, ""Shanghai Metro is suspended and non -stop.""  Since the end of March, since the end of March, it has been closed all over Shanghai, and most of the citizens have returned to their homes. But just like the Shanghai Metro, this calm city has not stopped, and its core function is still running where you see or not see.  one  At noon on May 13th, in a drizzle, the gas repair workers were replacing a threaded threaded tube at the intersection of Hechuan Road, Caobao Road. There were no cars on the road next to them, nor did they pass by. Another unknown construction. It is these people and behind -the -scenes work that ensure the gas needs of citizens' homes.  Along the East China Sea Bridge all the way to the east, the ending point is Yangshan ""Energy Island"", where the ""behind the scenes"" with deeper gas is hidden. Here, Shanghai LNG Co., Ltd., as the main source of gas in the city, bears more than 50%of natural gas supply in Shanghai. Since the epidemic, the company's staff has been in the Yanshan receiving station for nearly two months.  Also running continuously is the grid. The Shanghai Main Power Grid has ushered in the peak of maintenance. In May, it arranged 250 maintenance missions in a single month, most of which are high -risk and large -scale centralized maintenance of 500 kV and above power stations. At the same time The key project of the peak summer is also being promoted, and the overall workload is equivalent to about 70%of the same period of the previous year.  two  On May 11th, in Lingang, Shanghai, the person in charge of a car accessory company told reporters proudly: ""As a supporting company in Tesla, we are the first batch of work and re -production, but the speed we start is Biguisla. It's faster, starting a day earlier than them. ""  This company specializes in the production of automotive steering wheels, airbags and other accessories, which represents a part of the long industrial chain of the automotive industry. It is a first -level supplier of the OEM, and there are second, third, and fourth levels in the lower reaches ... and even more providers. Sample any level will affect the production of the vehicle.  At the beginning of the epidemic, some links in the supply chain were interrupted. On April 18, Shanghai launched the first batch of ""white list"" enterprises to resume work, and the supply chain gradually continued. The production capacity of many companies has returned to more than 70 % before the epidemic.  ""After the resumption of work, the biggest change is to communicate with suppliers at all times. Which goods are available and which goods are broken, and they are always changing."" The person in charge of the company told reporters. On the one hand, the supply is still unstable; on the other hand, the entire industry has new changes and new weather every day. Taking Tesla as an example, since the production and re -production, it has been loaded many times and exported tens of thousands of cars overseas.  Not only are the automotive industry, biomedicine, integrated circuits and other industries have undergone a stagnation for a period of time, and they are stepping up to restore production capacity. At present, more than 9,000 industrial enterprises above designated size in Shanghai have resumed more than 4,400, accounting for nearly 50%.  three  In early April, a picture of AIS (ship information recognition system) was circulated on the Internet. This seemingly professional picture shows: ships are densely densely covered by Shanghai Port, and their images are even overlapped to cover the sea surface. ""The delay of ports is getting worse"", ""The number of ships waiting to load and unloading in Shanghai Port this week has soared to more than 300.""  The Shanghai Port Group immediately announced internal data: Since March 28, the average downs time of the Shanghai -Hong Kong container ship is less than 24 hours, and the average parked ship is less than 10 times. Polling efficiency is significantly better than the overall level of 2021. On the sea outside the shoreline, no container ships were lined up.  As an international shipping center, Shanghai has not stopped shipping even during the epidemic. The giant bridge on the front line of Shanghai Port Wharf was lifted up and down, and never stopped due to the epidemic. From January to April this year, Shanghai Port completed a total of 15.348 million standard boxes, a year -on -year increase of 1.8%. Among them, in April, Shanghai Port completed a standard box of 3.085 million container throughput, resumed to 82.4%of the same period last year. Entering May, Shanghai Port container throughput continued to maintain a good momentum of recoverable growth.  The airport also continues to run. Since May, Pudong Airport Charter has continued, highlighting the function of the Shanghai Port to the Yangtze River Delta and the national distribution distribution function. In the early morning of May 1st, 80 tons of cargo of Roche Diagnostic Products (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. entered from German charter, including in vitro diagnostic instruments and reagent consumables. Except for the supply of Shanghai, the rest were quickly transported to hospitals in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fujian and other places. , Pathological Research Center, etc.; On May 8th, a DHL charter flight with a full 37 -ton imported expressway was flying from Hong Kong to Pudong Airport. The goods include Electric equipment accessories that are urgently needed by companies such as Siemens and Amborgia.  According to data from Shanghai Airport Group and Shanghai Customs, since May, Pudong Airport's cargo and postal throughput has continued to rise, with an average daily guarantee of 118 freight flights, with an average daily freight volume of more than 5,300 tons, an increase of 37%and 64%from the same period in April.  Four  At 9:30 am on May 16th, the Shanghai A shares ushered in a trading day in the epidemic.  Since this round of epidemic, the transactions of Shanghai motherboards and science and technology boards have not stopped one day, and they have always maintained normal operation. Behind this is a plan of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The Shanghai Stock Exchange formed a team of 55 people in mid -March to fully closed the office at the Golden Bridge Data Center. At present, the team has closed the office for more than two months, and has undertaken the main production operations of the core trading business and technology, as well as 7 × 24 hours operation and maintenance monitoring work.  At the same time as the Shanghai City transactions are as usual, major financial factors such as Shanghai Futures Exchange and China Financial Futures Exchange have opened market transactions on time to maintain smooth operation. Financial institutions such as banks, insurance, and securities firms also arranged personnel to resident or remote office. The smooth flow of financial blood in the country is still not affected.  During the epidemic, financial stability, and international financial institutions are still optimistic about China and Shanghai. Many foreign asset management institutions such as Hanlong Capital and Belle German Fund have recently actively applied for the Shanghai QFLP and QDLP pilots to participate in the construction of the Shanghai Global Asset Management Center. In addition, international institutions such as Creditkin Investment have also planned to increase their business in China and submit an application for additional pilot quotas. The leaders of the global asset management industry have increased the trust votes for the Shanghai International Financial Center and even the Chinese economy.  five  On May 16th, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics Fu Linghui first said a meaningful words when answering questions from the reporter: a while ago, due to the cold air, it once cooled down. However, the short -term temperature changes are abnormal fluctuations, which cannot change the situation of the general gradually recovering.

Finally, it was a list of 45 volunteers in the hands of the secretary. They were assigned to the four groups: Gate's duty, courier handling, patrolling and disinfecting, and supporting drug protection.

This defense war is related to the offline vehicle. The supply chain extends from overseas to many places in the country. The difference in one link means that the front work is abandoned.  In late March, the car's ""core lack"" is still intensifying. SAIC -GM secondary supplier Han La Cori Mobile Electronics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., fixed cooperation overseas suppliers cannot deliver. Hama Kori had to ask for help from other factories, regardless of cost and active stocking, from South Korea and Malaysia to 209,000 vehicle controller chips and power conversion transistor and other automotive components. With the unstable international flight resources, the company chose the high channel of aviation express, and the goods finally arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in early April.  But there are many levels of this distance. When the chip arrived at the airport, Pudong and Puxi have successively opened control. At that time, the Federal Express, which carried the chip, was located at the International Express and Freight Center of Pudong Airport. It only maintained the minimum operation with extremely limited people. These chips were inevitably drowned in a large number of ""Wangyang sea"" that could not be timely tone. Hanskori moves 100,000 in a hurry. Enterprises need to quickly get these key parts and components, complete the controller assembly steps in its factory, and then quickly send them to Suzhou Wandu Factory at the first -level supplier of Shangqi. Then, the car transportation of the car is stepped up to the Wuhan plant that is universal, and the 1,000 entire vehicle is delivered to the offline delivery.  Zhu Qiaohong has been calculated by thousands of calculations, ""Dedicating the processing time and transportation time of the two plants in Suzhou.

What made Zhu Qiaohong lamented that in early April, the first batch of key enterprises ""whitelist"" has not been announced, but based on a deep understanding of the industrial chain and supply chain, Pudong Airport Customs has already begun to touch Shanghai Integrated Circuit, biomedicine, automobiles and other industries, actively pull the enterprise into the corporate contact group in advance. Zhu Qiaohong said that on the morning of April 7, after confirming that the cargo had arrived at the cargo station, the enterprise urgently declared to Pudong Airport Customs. Just wait for the enterprise to declare, that is, to open the green channel, implement a precise and efficient logistics circulation plan, and realize that the goods are inspected.

In the battle of Huangpu's epidemic, he took the ""hard bone"" in the old city compartment. At present, the number of newly positive infections every day in Menghua Street has a significant decline in a steady decline, and has fallen to single digits for several days.  鏖 宫 宫 宫 宫 宫 宫 宫 宫  On April 2nd, Wang Yucai, who was on duty in the residential area, received a call from his superiors. ""Menghua Street has a very serious epidemic situation. The director of the Xuegong Neighborhood Committee was isolated at home for diagnosis in the building. People are scarce. I hope you will support your work and prepare for the preparation.""  Wang Yucai, who received the order, immediately cleaned up his bag and went to the Xue Palace Residence Commission on the day. ""Due to the long -term closed -loop management of the residential area, the mood of the people is easier to fluctuate, and the pressure of the grassroots is definitely very great. I have worked in the Palace of the Palace for more than ten years. I am familiar with the residents here.  The accident followed. On the second day when he settled in, the secretary of the neighborhood committee was diagnosed and needed to be separated. Faced with such news, the emotional collapse of the cadres of the neighborhood committee who had worked for more than ten consecutive days, and some people resigned on the spot.  In danger, Wang Yucai was appointed as the ""acting secretary"". The first instruction after taking office was to arrange for all staff to rest on the spot. ""Everyone has been standing for a few days for 24 hours, and the fatigue point of physical and mental exhaustion is reached. Only by resting can we continue to fight.""  Other residents cadres can rest, but work cannot stop; Wang Yucai carried his work alone. When the residents rushed to the neighborhood committee to ask for questions, they suddenly saw Wang Yucai sitting there, and always asked the last sentence unexpectedly, ""Secretary Wang, how do you come back? You are there, we will be at ease!"" Wang Yucai will always listen patiently on the problems and complaints of residents. ""What is a bit wronged, and what is roared twice and what is the responsibility of my shoulders.""  Through three days of sorting and reception, Wang Yucai listed the demands of the residents one by one. ""The main demands are concentrated on the problem of dating, seeing a doctor, and eating for the elderly. These are the most urgent issues of people's livelihood. We must find a way to solve it."" He reported these problems to street leaders and received strong support and help. With the gradual solution of the problem, the emotions of residents are slowly stable, and various tasks have been carried out smoothly. ""To let the masses feel‘ party members ’is just around’, we will serve and understand them wholeheartedly. ""  After two days of ""local rest"", the cadres of the neighborhood committees ""resurrected blood with blood"" again. Under the coordination of Wang Yucai, when everyone dealt with various tasks, it became more and more orderly. ""No matter how hard and troublesome, after the solution, the residents will thank you, which will become the power to support us to stick to your post.""  Return to Caojia Street  After 14 days of persistence and transfer, the situation of the epidemic in the residential area of the palace has improved. Wang Yucai received a new task and asked him to go to the Caojiajie neighborhood committee on the situation. Without hesitation, Wang Yucai once again carried his bag and went straight to the Caojia Street neighborhood committee.  At this time, the cadres of the neighborhood committee were at this cabin or temporary isolation point, leaving him for less than half of the special security players. ""Life is unfamiliar, and it is difficult to work."" But he did not have time to consider difficulties, and his work immediately unfolded.  He summoned the remaining personnel to meet and divided the work tasks. Everyone performed their duties and accurately positioning, and appointed the ""more familiar"" special insurance team leader as the deputy to better implement the work. At the same time, he emphasizes the team spirit. If someone completes the task first, he will support other people. Everyone is a whole. We must support each other. In addition, the ""temporary retirement"" neighborhood committee cadres also supported it to support online support at the square or temporary isolation point to accelerate residents' transfer.  In addition to ensuring the daily life and medication needs of residents, Wang Yucai devoted all his energy to the transfer. ""Earlier is a little bit, and one step is one step. Only by turning around, and with timely disinfecting, the risk of community infection will minimize.""  Ten days later, most positive infections in the residential area were successfully transferred. When the overall situation tended to improve, Wang Yucai ""moved"" again.  Decisive Battle Temple  This time, his destination was the Temple of Language, and the task became a tackling. When he arrived at the Wenmiao neighborhood committee, there were only two staff members left here; but the transfer and tackling tasks were heavy, and some residents resolutely refused to transfer.  The fight against the fight again! Some positive residents are a pair of mother and son, who is not willing to communicate with the outside world and refuse to transfer. ""I have worked in the second -level old for many years. I know the residents here very well. Behind the rejection, there must be difficulties in us to solve."" Wang Yucai learned that this family has a eldest son. After some persuasion, my brother promised to communicate with his brother. Finally, I learned that my brother was worried that his mother was lacking care at the isolation point, so she refused to transfer. Wang Yucai immediately said that he would try to communicate and arrange medical staff to take care of his mother, and her younger son finally agreed to cooperate with the transfer.  Seven days later, with the full support of the streets and departments, Zero-Covid was basically completed. With the return of the staff of the neighborhood committee, Wang Yucai once again picked up the sac, set off again, and devoted himself to the transfer work.  Virus Dad  For more than 40 days, Wang Yucai always fought the worst in the epidemic, but he never complained and scared. ""As a member of the party, a veteran has taken root in the front line of the community for 16 years. I must fulfill their duties. During this anti -epidemic process, the people have paid a lot, and they are also very supportive of our work. I have to do a good job of work. To get the praise of residents is the greatest recognition of me. ""  So far, Wang Yucai, who has been fighting against the front line of the epidemic, can't go home. He has a pair of children very much. His son is 7 years old and his daughter is 3 years old. The happiest thing every day is to chat with them at 10 o'clock in the evening. ""I work too busy during the day to get the time at night. The children who are used to going to bed early always say that I want to talk to me before resting. I am the dad who goes to the virus in their mouths.""  Wang Yucai, 40, was the youngest director of Shanghai's youngest full -time neighborhood committee. When he was 24 years old, he passed the direct election and served as the director of the Academic Palace's neighborhood committee. This was a rare thing that year. ""Over the years, I have changed from 'little king' to‘ Secretary Wang ’. I also saw that more and more young people joined the grass -roots teams. I felt that this was a career worthy of struggle.”  During the telephone interview with Wang Yucai, his voice was obviously hoarse. Recently, he was busy transferring to work. He often continued until early in the morning, and he was going to work early the next day.

In -depth understanding, concern and inquire about the arrangements of the supply guarantee of basic living materials in the factory area. Li Qiang pointed out that it is necessary to continue to touch and grasp the bottom number, and resolutely in accordance with the requirements of the ""four response"" to increase the efforts. Those with positive infections should be turned all over and fast. It should be separated by fast, so as to fast, day and Qing Ri. For newly -added infected people, we must achieve full coverage of flow tone, strengthen data integration and utilization in various aspects, improve the accuracy of flow tone, and completely block the epidemic transmission chain.  During the inspection, Li Qiang listened to the latest progress of Xu Hui and Yangpu's social face ZERO-COVID. Promote. Li Qiang emphasized that we must resolutely overcome paralysis thoughts, mood, luck, and relaxed mentality.

After a month, when Wang Gang, the founder of Kaiyu Biotechnology Co., Ltd. returned to the company, was a bit strange, ""but finally killed back!"" He said.  Kaiyu Biological is a biomedical company located in Minhang, Shanghai. It has developed innovative restructuring proteases. It is a raw enzyme supplier of the domestic COVID-19MRNA vaccine research and development company. After the outbreak of this round, it was suspended. On May 3rd, Kaiyu Biosi obtained a re -work certificate approved by the Minhang District Economic Committee. After the application for the Passing Period was submitted on the same day, 19 employees, including Wang Gang, returned to the company.  At present, the Shanghai epidemic has been effectively controlled, and the conditions for re -production and production are increasingly improved. Among the more than 9,000 industrial enterprises in the city, more than 4,400 have been resumed, of which 666 key enterprises have re -working rates of more than 95%. Key industries such as automobiles, integrated circuits, biomedical and other key industries have continued to recover and improve production capacity, and leading enterprises continue to maintain stable production. Wu Jinsheng, director of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, said at a press conference on the 13th: ""Re -work and re -production work has achieved staged results.""  Companies like Kaizhen creatures more and more re -production are more than day by day. During the sealing period, the silent machine was powered on, and the stop gear was rotated again, which led to the entire economic chain and a company on the chain.  Production chain  Contemporary enterprises do not exist independently, but a part of the combination. They not only need to pay attention to themselves, but also pay attention to upstream and downstream companies. Because of the correlation between enterprises, the entire industrial chain must be taken into account, not just a few large factories.  The association is particularly reflected in the automotive industry. The output of vehicles in Shanghai and its surrounding areas accounts for 15%-20%of the country, and the scale of the parts and components industries accounts for about 30%of the country. Under the dense supply chain conduction, the radiation range of many mainstream component companies in this region to the area of this area far exceeds the long triangle and across the country. Taking Tesla as an example, nearly 200 primary and secondary suppliers affected by the epidemic since March.  According to statistics from research institutions, the first batch of 666 enterprises on the ""whitelist"" on the ""white list"" in Shanghai, with 249 companies as the automotive industry chain enterprises. Kunyi Electronics is an enterprise engaged in automotive electronics development and testing services. Customers cover many vehicles and component suppliers. Kunyi Electronics is the second batch of ""whitelist"" enterprises for work and re -production. At present, 30 or 40 employees have worked in the company's closed -loop. Chen Qi, the company's chief executive officer, introduced that the employees of these resumed work are responsible for product assembly testing, and he and more than 200 other employees (mainly engineers) are remotely office. ""Such arrangements can basically guarantee production."" Chen Qi said, ""But today some customers let us go to the scene to debug, because it is not possible to get out of Shanghai, and work will still be affected.""  Mai Ruiling Survey Technology Co., Ltd. is also a car supply chain company that provides measurement equipment for production lines. Similar to Kunyi Electronics, Mai Ruiling also divided the employees into two parts: 11 people resumed work, responsible for product assembly and debugging; other employees (mainly designers) were at home. The company manager Huang Shengbin introduced that in the past ten days of resumption, the company has delivered 5 devices to customers. ""From the perspective of financial data, the impact of the epidemic is very miserable, because there is no invoicing in April, and there is no income without invoicing. But in fact, the impact on orders has little impact. Although we are at home, customers can still contact us, and we can still contact us, and we can still contact us and can still contact us. When placing orders, people don't have to meet. ""Huang Shengbin said.  Logistics chain  Connected to the production chain is only the first step. Enterprise anxiety also has logistics. At the stage where the epidemic is the most severe, many companies have experienced the pain of ""the raw materials cannot be transported and the products cannot be transported"". Re -labor and re -production must connect the logistics chain.  Since 2020, the global integrated circuit industry has been frequently affected. This round of epidemic is coming, and whether the raw materials of the Shanghai integrated circuit industry can be supplied, all parties are very concerned. Shanghai is one of the most complete, highest technical and largest cities in the national integrated circuit industry chain. In 2021, sales revenue accounted for about one -quarter of the country. Since the resumption of work in the field of Shanghai Integrated Circuit, chip manufacturing enterprises have maintained more than 90%of production capacity, and SMIC, Huahong Group, and Jijita Semiconductor have maintained full load production, driving a number of equipment, materials, seal testing and other supporting enterprises to accelerate the acceleration Resume work.  The ""group buying machine"" of the Shanghai Integrated Circuit industry has played a huge role in this round of epidemic. In September last year, due to the global epidemic, international flights were tight. They were led by the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Association. With the support of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, Shanghai Customs and Airlines, related logistics companies opened up lithography, anti -reflected film All key nodes of charter machines such as generating liquids such as generating liquids. In April of this year, the Shanghai chip industry once again opened the ""group purchase machine"" model. On average, there were raw materials such as 8 to 10 tons of lithography glue per week. ""Safety inventory"".  Small and medium -sized enterprises are more flexible. Kunyi Electronics has set up temporary transit stations in the surrounding cities of Shanghai. The raw materials from the upstream and the products from the downstream are all transferred through the transit station. Enterprises only need to apply for a logistics license to drive to and from Shanghai and surrounding cities.  ""However, transportation is still difficult. Although we have all sent out the 5 devices, they are all laborious."" Mai Ruiling's Huang Shengbin said.  Policy chain  At present, enterprises will encounter various difficulties that are not expected. The industrial chain supporting, personnel return, and logistics and transportation are blocking points to varying degrees. For example, in the early stage, some streets and parks were worried about affecting the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the conditions for re -work of the enterprise would be increased. Zhang Hongtao, chief engineer of the Municipal Economic and Information Commission, said: ""This is not necessary or should not be.""  To get through these blocks, the policy chain is needed. Wu Jinsheng introduced that Shanghai has gradually expanded the scope of the issuance of vehicle traffic permit and a personnel re -work certificate. More than 100,000 resumption certificates have been issued to help enterprise employees return in an orderly manner; the special class of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai across provinces has been established, and more than 2,400 parental triangle and other brothers and cities have re -service and logistics transportation demands in Shanghai.  Under the guidance of policy, one after another after another after another, Shanghai companies have been resumed. In the ""Life Blue Bay"" in Lingang, most of the biomedical companies have re -started. On April 21, the three special cars with the ""Temporary Pass"" drove into the production base of Zhege Biology at the ""Life Blue Bay"". This trip was to connect the resumption personnel back to the company for closed -loop production management. Chen Jianxin, the company's chief executive officer, said: ""Making medicine must grab time and compete for speed. At present, the company has undertaken dozens of projects. Whether we or customers, we hope to go all out to ensure production capacity.""  The Southwest Securities Research Report believes that the current resumption of work in the Shanghai Industrial Chain has promoted the borderline of the industry's supply end. In the environment of expanding domestic demand, demand recovery needs to be slowly mapped, and the fundamental expectations will gradually be restored.",Shanghai; policy chain; integrated circuit industry; industrial chain; integrated circuit industry; biomedicine; biomedicine; biomedicine;,

During the epidemic, the flow of relevant personnel and objects was restricted, and many licenses who were about to expire were embarrassed to handle related offline businesses. The Shanghai market supervision department solved the urgency of operators by exploring the ""tolerance acceptance"" and other models. Since the epidemic, 27 projects in the city have successfully settled the ""Shanghai"" through the ""tolerance acceptance"" method.  Due to objective reasons, the operators who cannot complete the relevant registration business before the deadline have also had the opportunity to ""breathe"". The Shanghai Market Supervision Department has introduced the convenience measures for related license matters such as food production during the epidemic. Food production enterprises with food production licenses due to the impact of the epidemic cannot apply for a continuation of the license, and the validity period of the food production license is postponed to one month after the epidemic was lifted.  During the epidemic, ""not meeting approval"" became the ""just need"" of operators, especially for some small and medium -sized enterprises. In this regard, the market regulatory department guides the proceeds to handle the registration and registered business online, and implement the full process of paperless online processing model.

(Reporter Shi Ni) The reporter learned from the city's COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference held yesterday that the situation of the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control situation continued to be steady and good, and the goal of realizing the social Zero-Covid in the middle of the month. By then, the implementation of orderly release, limited flow, effective control, and classification management will be implemented. In accordance with the normalization requirements of the epidemic prevention and control, it is gradually transformed from the sealing control areas, control areas, and prevention areas under emergency response to the classification management of high, low -high risk areas under normalization prevention and control.  Wu Qing, member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee and Executive Deputy Mayor, introduced that since the epidemic of the epidemic, Shanghai has insisted on the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not shaken, and has made every effort to curb the spread of the epidemic and ensure the safety of the people's lives and health. At present, the prevention and control situation of the Shanghai epidemic is continued to be steady and good. Although there are still some slight fluctuations, more than 99%of the positive infected people have found in the closed -loop control. 6 cases. At the same time, we must also see that some old communities, urban villages and other key areas still have a certain risk of rebound in the epidemic, and the foundation of the prevention and control is not stable. It is necessary to continue to promote Zero-Covid. Judging from the current epidemic prevention and control, the city needs to work together.  Shanghai has developed the overall plan to continue to consolidate the results of the prevention and control of the epidemic and regains the order of normal production and life in an orderly manner. Considering the existing resumption of work and re -production, further expand the resumption of work and re -production, promotes the re -school in order, and resume the city's normal as soon as possible as soon as possible.

Wu Qing introduced that combined with the Shanghai epidemic and the actual situation of the oversized cities, comprehensive experts and other parties, the evaluation criteria of ""Social Face Zero-Covid"" and ""Social Basic Zero-Covid"" were clarified The number of positive infections in the community (including management control areas, prevention zones, and social mobile personnel with non -closed -loop management) is increasingly reduced and risky. Although there may still be a very small number of positive infections every day, if for three consecutive days in a row, it may be three consecutive days in a row. The proportion of a new increase in a single day in a single day is less than one-100,000 in the district, and you can think that ""the basic Zero-Covid"" is considered; if the number of new numbers in a single day in three consecutive days can be considered as Face-Covid "".  ""Social dynamic Zero-Covid"" refers to the timely extinguisory of the local epidemic, and through the rapid cutting of the epidemic in the society, the social infection of the social infection quickly ZERO-COVID's goal. To realize ""Social Zero-Covid"", it shows that the community transmission of the epidemic has been blocked. It is an important prerequisite for gradually unblocking and restoring normalization prevention and control.  After the social Zero-Covid, it will comprehensively judge and orderly restore the normal production and living order in an orderly manner, and gradually enter the normalized prevention and control stage of the social dynamic Zero-Covid.

This is the first time that the ""Greater Shanghai Defense War"" has proposed a clear timeline of Zero-Covid. However, this transcript is not easy to get, and it must be cherished; the goal of Zero-Covid, this society, is by no means easy to get it.  At present, the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control is at a critical stage of emergency response to normalization prevention and control conversion. Many citizens have found that the community of themselves or relatives and friends has slowly reappeared. As the express delivery and takeaway industry gradually resume production and resumption, life seems to gradually enter the right track. However, the rebound of ""once returning to liberation"" is also common. ""Risk in flow"" has become the most important issue at this stage. In this regard, the reporter invited Ding Yuan, deputy director of the Shanghai Health Promotion Center to talk about how the general public should start from themselves, and will prevent and control it and make the virus as ""out of the door.""  Ding Yuan pointed out that the extremely high hidden and contagious of Omikon's mutant strains did not decrease over time. ""If it is the critical period of the sprint in Shanghai, then we must keep the prison. Defense, tightness of self -discipline. ""  She mentioned that the seal -control area can ""not leave the house"" and the control area can ""not get out of the community"". In addition, there are also social mobile personnel with non -closed -loop management. Test. ""Everyone noticed that recently there have been new risks and new cases related to express delivery and takeaway. This is the"" risk of flow "", but it is also the risk that each citizen friend can minimize.""  Ding Yuan said that the types of goods in express delivery, takeaway, and group purchases have become rich in the near future, and there are many non -necessities. ""Of course, we can understand everyone's mood. The sealing time is very long, and the life of not the household is boring. Some food not only satisfies appetite, but also adds fun to life. However, at this critical stage, we still recommend Try to focus on the necessities, make life simpler, and usher in free life after unblocking. ""  So, what precautions should be taken for items that have been purchased or must be purchased? She mentioned that first, I should try to choose from regular platforms and websites as much as possible. Relevant practitioners have stricter supervision requirements such as health monitoring, and it is easy to trace the source in the purchase and logistics links.  Second, there are no shortage of cold chain products in the items purchased by citizens. ""Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, cold chain products are one of the high-risk ways for virus transmission. Therefore, the elimination of outer packaging has also become the focus of everyone's attention."" It takes at least 30 minutes to be sent to the inhabitants of the residents after arriving at the community. ""As the weather gradually gets hot, the quality of the product may be affected. Therefore, relevant factors should also be considered before buying items. Try not to buy. ""  Third, she once again emphasized that the community security or volunteers should do a good job of disinfecting the first level to ensure that all items entering the community have completed the out -of -pack disinfecting and static settlement. ""After the residents get the items, they should disassemble the outer packaging outdoors as outdoors, throw it directly into the trash can, and wipe and spray the internal packaging. The disinfection agent, for not urgent use, non -freezing refrigerator, can be placed for 10 to 30 minutes. ""  Fourth, to prevent the ""risk in flow"", it is inseparable from the cooperation of express delivery and takeaway delivery staff. During the service process, we should wear masks and gloves throughout the process. Try to minimize contact with other people when picking up and sending parts, do a good job of daily health monitoring, and resolutely cannot ""get sick"". If symptoms occur or abnormal in antigen and nucleic acid detection, the management personnel should be reported as soon as possible.  Fifth, Ding Yuan mentioned another detail that is easy to be ignored -the transportation tools of express delivery and takeaway delivery staff disinfected. Express transportation vehicles should be cleaned and disinfected daily, especially for frequent contacts such as steering wheels, door handles, and armrests, and we must focus on cleaning and disinfection. It can be disinfected with 250 mg/L chlorine or chlorine -liquid -containing disinfection of chlorine or effective chlorine. After 30 minutes, wipe it clean with water.  ""All the two months have come all the way, and citizens' friends have worked very hard. Thank you for your efforts and dedication. Let us continue to use self -discipline and adhere to the key battles, work together, and eventually usher in the dawn of victory.""

Principal and teachers generally believe that on the premise of meeting the premise of preventing and controlling the epidemic, it is necessary to leave a period of time for candidates to study at school, consolidate the results of the review, stabilize the mentality before the test, and adapt to the examination environment, so as to be better in a better state. Welcome the exam  The newspaper (reporter Gu Yong) The press conference of the municipal epidemic prevention and control work held yesterday reported that according to the current situation of the epidemic prevention and control, after careful research and reporting to the Ministry of Education, the Shanghai Autumn College Entrance Examination Examination was postponed until July 7 As of the 9th, the high school academic level level test was postponed from June 18th to 19th, and the high school entrance examination was extended to July 11th to 12th. The total score of the entrance examination for enrollment.  Do a good job of caring for candidates  According to Chen Qun, deputy mayor, due to the epidemic, since March 12, students and children of small and medium -sized support for small and medium -sized trusts in the city have stopped going to school to arrive at the park. Management, it has been 57 days so far.  This year, more than 50,000 candidates in the city will participate in the autumn college entrance examination, and 110,000 candidates will participate in the middle school entrance examination. Because the epidemic has made the above adjustment, it is mainly based on three aspects of consideration: First, before the big test, it is necessary to leave the necessary time for the senior high school students to go to the school to study as possible. After the epidemic, the students walked directly into the examination room from the house, and the state of the exam may be difficult to guarantee. Principal and teachers generally believe that on the premise of meeting the premise of preventing and controlling the epidemic, it is necessary to leave a period of time for candidates to study at school, consolidate the results of the review, stabilize the mentality before the test, and adapt to the examination environment, so as to be better in a better state. Welcome to the exam.  The second is to leave a certain time interval between the level test and the autumn unified examination. The autumn unified examination comparison level test rights are important, and a certain time interval is left between the two exams, so that the candidates will concentrate on reviewing for a period of time after completing the level test to meet the tests of the three subjects of the language, numbers, and foreign countries. More reasonable and in line with past practice.  The third is to make the examination arrangements more operable. The physical and chemical experiments of the middle school entrance examination and foreign language hearing and speaking tests have high requirements for epidemic prevention in the examination room, and the organization is more difficult. It accounts for a low weight in the total scores, especially because of the epidemic cause. The third grade students are actually unable to receive rationalized experimental training. After comprehensive consideration, these two tests were decided to cancel these two tests this year, and the relevant scores were included in the total score of the middle school entrance examination.  Chen Qun said that the power inside and outside the education system will be mobilized to further do both aspects. One is to do a good job of concern and help with candidates, especially for candidates who have infected with COVID-19 and a close isolation experience, fighting for parents to fight for parents. Candidates who are relatively difficult in the front line of resistance and learning conditions, ""one person, one policy"" carefully do a good job.  The second is to optimize and improve the emergency plan, and create the conditions of ""testing should be examined"". Based on the establishment of conventional test sites and test rooms, emergency test sites and test rooms are established according to the need for epidemic prevention. After the college entrance examination and middle school entrance examination extended, the probability of typhoon, lightning, and heavy rain will increase. In response, departments such as education, meteorology, public security, transportation, hydropower protection, etc. will closely link to simulate exercises to effectively prevent response.  In addition, the recent educational examination arrangements of this city will be made in accordance with the internal associations of different examinations and publish them to the society in a timely manner. In response to the enrollment of kindergartens and compulsory education enrollment, compared with last year, the overall policy is stable this year. The rules will be released in the end of this month and will leave enough time for registration and relevant procedures. The issue of returning to school will be based on the changes in the prevention and control situation of the epidemic, combined with the characteristics of all grades and grades, and will be carefully arranged and announced to the society in a timely manner.  It is promoting employment from three aspects  A total of 227,000 graduates of Shanghai college this year (an increase of 20,000 more than last year, the increase in 5 years). As of May 6, the implementation rate of the graduation destination was 36.47%, which was 10.03 percentage points higher than the same period in 2020, but it was 6.54 percentage points lower than the same period last year. The employment of college graduates was facing great pressure.  Chen Qun introduced that colleges and universities have now generally transferred to quasi -closed management status. The city requires schools to implement grid management, and to do a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic, and do their best to complete the dissertation, graduation design, and defense for students. Create conditions, and at the same time, we must draw a special and sufficient power to do a good job of supporting the employment and entrepreneurship of graduates.  The Municipal Education Commission is trying to promote employment from three aspects. The first is to launch a strong employment promotion policy for graduates. Recently, 11 departments have jointly introduced documents to promote employment and entrepreneurship of college graduates to promote the promotion and entrepreneurship measures and entrepreneurship measures and entrepreneurial promotion measures and entrepreneurial promotion measures and entrepreneurial policies of grass -roots policy, corporate tax reduction and exemption and social security subsidies, and entrepreneurial loans. Essence For example, the recruitment plan of the municipal and district -owned enterprises this year will be arranged to recruit graduates of universities in our city with no less than 50%. The recruitment plans of the district, streets and public institutions of the year will be tilted with fresh graduates. In addition, the needs of key areas such as the Pilot Free Trade Zone and the construction of five new cities will be connected, and coordination and services will be strengthened to expand more job resources for fresh graduates. Chen Qun called for employers, especially enterprises to adjust the original recruitment procedures according to the actual situation, reduce the requirements for the internship period, and sign an agreement with students as soon as possible.  The second is to strengthen network recruitment and job recruitment. Since March, the layered classification of municipalities, districts, and universities has carried out many online recruitment activities. Among them, the graduate online recruitment fair organized by the municipal -level organization has provided more than 200,000 positions. By the end of August, it continued to push high -quality positions and strive to reduce the adverse effects caused by offline recruitment that cannot be carried out normally. At the same time, the Municipal Education Commission is also connected with the provincial provincial and municipal employment departments to seek support and provide more online recruitment opportunities and employment resources for graduates of Shanghai college.  The third is to optimize employment services and career guidance. Shanghai will continue to optimize the employment policy of graduates. In 2022, the fresh graduates of non -Shanghai student colleges and universities entering Shanghai Employment and Application for Employment Application Shanghai Family Register will be accepted in two batches of reference to 2020. At the end of the month, the second batch will be opened by the end of 2022. Relevant departments have connected the employment services of college graduates to the ""Government Cloud"", relying on the ""One Netcom Office"" platform to launch the application of ""one thing for student employment services"". Graduates can obtain employment information on their mobile phones, view recruitment progress, complete completion Signing on the Internet.  In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education, colleges and universities will conduct in -depth special operations of the principal of the secretary's ""visiting enterprises to expand employment"", mobilize the mentors and counselors to participate in the employment of graduates, integrate the strength of all parties, and expand job resources. Difficulties, especially infected students, carry out employment guidance in a targeted manner, and provide more powerful support guarantees for graduates employment and entrepreneurship.  Chen Qun said that the city will mobilize the strength of all parties to do its best to employment for graduates, especially employment in Shanghai, to create good conditions.",University graduates employment; examination environment; epidemic prevention and control; network recruitment;,

Of the 245 cases of confirmation of the soil, 64 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 181 cases were asymptomatic to the confirmed case. Of the 4024 cases of non -symptoms of the soil, 4001 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 23 cases were found in the screening of relevant risk personnel. Of the 23 positive infections, 6 cases were found in the screening of key groups, 5 cases were found in the screening area screening, 11 cases were found in the screening of the prevention area, and 1 case was found in active nucleic acid detection. As of 24:00 on the 5th, 526 patients were treated at the designated medical institutions and 95 were in danger. There are 12 new local death cases, with an average age of 84.08 years. There were 1,390 cases of local confirmed cases in the city, and asymptomatic infected people withdrawn 10,406 cases of centralized isolation medical observation.  Jiading District realizes the basic society Zero-Covid  Wu Qing, member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee and Executive Deputy Mayor, introduced that since April 22, the number of people in the city's epidemic report has a decline in the number of positive infections for two consecutive weeks. The rate has gradually declined. The nucleic acid screening detected that the infected people have recently dropped to 5,000 people, and most of them are effectively curbed in the current dissemination of the epidemic community among the seal -controlled areas and isolated people. On the 5th, Jiading District reached the basic ZERO-COVID standards of the society. The city's cumulative 7 districts and some streets in Pudong and some streets and towns in Pudong were basic Zero-Covid. However, at present, the number of newly added positive infections in a single day has decreased, and there are still reports of positive infections in the society. The prevention and control tasks of key areas, key groups, and key links are still arduous, and Zero-Covid is also required to continue to promote the attack.  Wu Qing introduced that there are currently many rounds of screening in Shanghai. This is mainly because of the COVID-19 virus Omir Rong's mutant strain in this round of epidemic. It is difficult to discover at once. Expert research shows that when a round of nucleic acid screening is completed, infected people who have been infected and are detoxified can be detected by nucleic acid testing positive; infected infected with viruses and temporarily not detoxifying in vitro, nucleic acids have nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids, nucleic acids. The detection results show negative but unable to be discovered in time. In order to win the virus, discover potential infections as soon as possible, and cut off the potential transmission chain, continuously carried out nucleic acid testing in a consecutive oxytic acid test without ZERO-COVID.  The prerequisite for Shanghai to discover all positive infections is to ""check everything, do not leak a household, and do not fall into one person"". In order to achieve this goal, it will continue to improve the organization and create a safer, hygienic and orderly sampling environment. The positive infected person and close contact should be turned all over, and they should be separated. The public passages and elevators of the building where the positive infected person is located will be performed immediately after the infected person is transferred. concern. At the same time, the general public needs to carefully fulfill the personal obligations of the epidemic prevention and control, participate in each round of nucleic acid screening, and be responsible to themselves, to others, and to society.  The number of square cabins is half at the peak of the courtyard  At the peak of the epidemic, the number of municipal cabins in the courtyard reached 86,400, and the number of district -level squares was 184,800. With the changes in the recent epidemic situation, those with positive infections in the cabin have continued to decrease. At present, 48,188 cases were hospitalized in Shanghai, accounting for a total of more than 80%of the total number of local COVID-19 infections. As of 24:00 on the 5th, the number of two -class hospitals in the urban area has fallen to 39,600 and 76,500, respectively, while the number of people was less than half of the peak.

By May 5th, the city has set up a total of nearly 9,000 normalized nucleic acid samples, of which more than 5,000 points have been opened.  In the next step, Shanghai will retain a sufficient number of available beds according to the actual situation of the epidemic situation and the actual situation of Shanghai's newly added positive infection, and the other cabin will be classified and adjusted. For square cabins with poor conditions in the district -level square cabin and only undertake only temporary transfer isolation platforms, it will speed up shutdown. Earlier, a small number of district -level cabin built in the school will also exit priority, and the strictest cleaning, elimination and safety assessment will be performed.

Before traveling, confirm that there are no suspicious symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat. At the same time, prepare personal protective supplies, standardize the mask throughout the process, and keep a certain distance from other passengers, pay attention to cough and sneezing etiquette.  When taking a taxi or online car, it is recommended to call the destination and route in advance. After getting on the car, sit in the rear seats to maintain a good distance. Wear masks throughout the journey, open windows and ventilate, and keep air convection. When paying the fare, it is recommended to use no contact payment method to reduce contact with public goods.

The office environment should be kept clean and diligent. 75%alcohol cotton balls or disinfection wet towels can be cleaned and disinfected on the surface of office items such as keyboards, mouses and telephones. At the same time, pay attention to hand hygiene to avoid contact with the eyes and nose with your hands.  ""Handbook"" also reminds that non -independent office areas wear masks to reduce stay and chat in public areas such as the entrance halls, corridors, tea rooms. During the epidemic period, try not to meet, meet less, start short meetings, and try to use video conferences and other forms. If a meeting must be met, the scale of the meeting should be controlled, the conference room is ventilated, and the participants should wear a mask, and the seats are left.

Huang Changyong: Because of the two closes, we entered the state earlier. From the first case of the first case of the Hongqiao Road campus on March 8th, and the second case of the Huashan Road Campus on the 11th. Under the guidance of the Municipal Education Commission, the four campuses of the school started the school's quasi -closed management from March 13th. So far, more than a month has passed. Along the way, my colleagues, the school staff, and the logistical support personnel can feel it really: adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to resolutely protect the safety of campus and the health of teachers and students, and win this round. The inevitable choice of epidemic prevention and control.  Reporter: Why is ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" inevitable?  Huang Changyong: In our four campuses, students, faculty, and logistical supporters added nearly 3,000 together, which is relatively small. After starting the quasi -closed management, the management system of all campus has been operating normally, but the hand is less than usual. And once ""broken defense"", even if there is only a positive infection, in the case of a professional institution that cannot be responding quickly, to be honest, I am still a bit panic.  How to allow positive infections to transport and quickly treat them as soon as possible? When I encountered tight diseases and control resources, the personnel could not transfer the treatment for a while. How can I be isolated? How to check the close -ups and sub -densely sees before the infected person has the ability to disseminate? How to do a good job in the psychological comfort and guidance of relevant personnel, especially students? Although there are plans, a series of urgent issues are waiting for us to take out the action one by one to solve them one by one.  In school, we have a grass -roots party branch, a team of academic and working teams composed of counselors and heads. Essence It is conceivable that if you are at the grassroots level and in the community, there are fewer personnel in front lines, and they are not as good as the school that have a strict and familiar management system as usual. The tasks must be more difficult and more stressful.  From this point of view, I also think that it is necessary to implement the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" early and decisively. This is an inevitable choice for minimal cost prevention. Only in this way can we weave the epidemic prevention and control network and protect our homes and our city together.  Reporter: What difficulties did you and your colleagues encounter in the process of insisting on ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Huang Changyong: Every day during this time is a test of confidence and toughness of teachers and students. The party committee of the school was sold first. Comrade Xie Wei, the secretary of the party committee, and the members of our team were divided into four campuses, and they have been stationed in the school. It is ordinary and tough figures on campus one after another, which has slowly formed the basic state of calmness and response. The restlessness and anxiety gradually dissipated, and everyone's confidence is increasing.  After the campus implementation of quasi -closed management, the supply of vegetables from teachers and students has become one of the most concerned things for everyone, and anti -epidemic products have also begun to be nervous. At this time, we were very grateful to the alumni and all sectors of the society to help us. Du Jiang urgently purchased 18,000 pounds of fresh vegetables from Wuhan, and drove thousands of miles to his alma mater overnight; Sha Xiaolan, Chen He, Yuan Hong, Hu Ge and other alumni, including teachers and students, and parents, were actively donated to schools. The people of Dujiangyan sent 25 tons of fresh vegetables. Under the severe weather of the wind and rain all the way, the trucks arrived in the show for four or five hours in advance. Fosun Group, Xingzhi Global Fund and the brothers around them sent quilts, marching beds, etc. These aids not only solved the urgent urgent need, but also warmed our hearts.  On April 12, 27 students needed to be transferred from the school as a ""secret"". Under the coordination of the Municipal Education Commission, they were arranged to a hotel in Yancheng for isolation. During the isolation, the students deeply felt the friendly friendship and meticulous care of the local people in Shanghai. The anxiety and anxiety when they first arrived gradually faded.  Under the epidemic, many faculty employees who areolated at home also actively asked to return to the campus, participate in front -line resistance, and be with students; students and even parents understand some of the shortcomings and even shortcomings in the school work. They can also rationally express themselves. Assembly.  Campus is a ""small society"" for the whole society. But I believe that if the whole society work together, the society Zero-Covid must be expected to be realized as soon as possible.",epidemic prevention and control; logistics support personnel;,

""Ding Yuan said that the reason why the Shanghai epidemic is aggressive in this round. The high communication power is closely related, ""the staged results of the hard -to -immunity from the neighborhood are again 'from scratch', so as not to allow the infection and spreading 'dead ash to ignite', which requires the efforts of each of us."" The details of life that are easy to be ignored are the following two points-  First, keep distance. ""Some residents in the prevention area can get out of the door with a pass and go out to shop; residents in the controlled area can collect courier and diversion activities in the community. The influx of the same place at the same time will cause unnecessary harvesting and gathering. ""Ding Yuan said that when going out for necessary shopping, you should prepare the application code in advance, and follow the guideline to scan the place code to avoid growing at the door of the Shang Chao. Time stays; when receiving express delivery and losing garbage in the community, you should also go to the peak. The community neighborhood committee and property should guide different buildings to go downstairs during the period, ""If the total dumping time in the evening is 2 hours, you can follow the community according to the community. The location of the inner building is divided into a more detailed period. ""  At the same time, she also reminded that when continuing nucleic acid screening, considering the high propagation power of Omikon, the distance should be guaranteed by more than two meters, not the ""keep one meter of meters in the previous side of the COVID-19 other strains. The above distance "".  Second, reasonable disinfection. ""For ordinary families, courier items are the main targets of disinfection. We say that the character of the character with the same defense 'may be more critical to a certain extent."" Ding Yuan said that most communities have concentrated at the entrance of the community. The racks will disinfect the items, related facilities, and the environment. Therefore, after receiving the takeaway and courier calls, citizens' friends do not have to rush downstairs to retrieve it. It should give the community staff a certain elimination time. When collecting items, you still need to wear a mask and gloves. Package the outer packaging outdoors outdoors and throw it into the trash can, disinfect the internal packaging, and wipe and spray. The request is that you can see the obvious moist and hanging beads. Then settle for 10 to 30 minutes later. ""For not urgent items, you can continue to put it on the balcony to ventilate; Whether it is intact. ""Studies have pointed out that if it is not disinfected, Omircong's mutant plant stays on plastic products, stainless steel and other materials for a long time, which suggests that we must seize the key links for scientific disinfection.""  ""At present, food -related practitioners have routine nucleic acid detection requirements, but if you are still not assured, it is recommended to heat cooking."" She mentioned that all steps should be fully sanitary and disinfected by hand.  In addition, Ding Yuan also suggested that many citizens have pets in the house of citizens, and they also like to meet and talk when walking dogs on weekdays. The peak, avoid, reduce the opportunity to gather in the green belt. The staged results are not easy.

Chu Xu, his companion, told him: ""The comrades of the street said that the two of us have moved nearly a thousand boxes.""  This answer makes Zhang Fazhen feel incredible: ""I never know that my energy is so great, but it is not surprising that it can solve the difficulties of residents. It can do something for resistance, and the strength will continue to surge.""  On April 8th, as a force of the Shanghai Anti -Epidemic Party Member Commando (Minhang), this group of 42 party volunteers from 9 municipal agencies in Shanghai rushed to Xinhong Street to gather overnight and set up a temporary party general branch to build ""Strong fortress"". Within two weeks, they live with front -line personnel to assist in doing nucleic acid antigen detection, handling materials, and helping residents to distribute medicines ... where there is a difficult and dangerous task, where they are charged.  ""The party school teachers not only have a good hand holding, but the car is also slippery.""  The epidemic situation is severe and the grassroots are nervous. After reporting to Xinhong Street, the assault players were immediately assigned to the Fifth and Seventh residential areas of Huamei Road, the Fifth and Seventh and Seventh residential areas of Huamei Road, Ai Bo Er Village, and Hanghua First Village.  Unexpectedly, on the first day of construction, I encountered a ""encounter."" On the day, it was the city's scope to carry out the test of nucleic acids. The assault players, together with community cadres and volunteers, called residents to go downstairs in the residential area together to help residents out of the nucleic acid code and maintain order in line. From 2 pm, the sun Gao Zhao until 10:30 in the evening. The ""battle"" ended. During this time, the team members dripped the water and the rice was not stained.  With the increase in government deployment and the increase in group purchase volume of residents, the material transportation work in the community has become increasingly heavier, especially in several communities mainly for the elderly.  There are 1,460 buildings in the fifth residential area of Hanghua Yicun. The materials purchased by the residents and the government gift package must be distributed within half a day without nucleic acid testing. The cadres of the neighborhood committee felt that this was a ""impossible task."" The temporary party branch of the Hangyan 15 was composed of 5 comrades from the Party School of the Municipal Party Committee.

Every time the ""sweeping the building"", a team member eliminated the road. Others carried all kinds of materials from their shoulders, climbed from the first floor to the sixth floor, and then from the sixth floor to the first floor. Sweep the building at least twice a day. After a few consecutive days of continuous service, the residents said happily: ""When you hear footsteps, you know that you are here.""  ""I didn't expect, you are our"" medicine god """"  After the community's sealing control was extended, the distribution medicine became a prominent problem encountered by residents. Pu Xiaoli, who served in the No. 1 and 7 residential area, was from the party committee of the municipal government. On the first day, she spent more than 4 hours to go to Tongren Hospital to provide medicine for the residents. After returning, she took the initiative to send the medicine to the door. Time instructions. The next day, she started from taking the medical insurance card, participated in the whole process, and felt the needs of residents to distribute medicine. In the evening, the problems and suggestions found in the two days in the evening were sorted out to form a ""Drug"" and provided them to the Temporary Party's General Branch. On the third day, she led the Volunteer Service Group for Drug Special Division to assist in the purchase of about 110 residents for medication. When she was carrying two heavy bags and almost dragged on the ground, she appeared at the door of the neighborhood committee.  When helping residents to support residents, they found that due to various reasons, neighboring community hospitals in the nearby area cannot provide drug distribution services. After they reported the situation to the Temporary Party's general branch in time, they pushed to open this block.  ""Blood loss is blood, bring out a service team""  ""Grass -roots comrades are in a state of tight for a long time, and they need the assistance of all parties."" A party member assault team said that fortunately, the situation is gradually improving. Everyone is full of confidence and more residents stand up to participate in community management.  With the deepening of volunteer services, the Temporary Party Branch requires that the temporary party branches will make their hands and continue to launch the community in -service party members.  The Interim Party Branch of Aibo Ercun and the neighborhood committee actively communicated. The assault players from the Municipal People's Congress and the Municipal Taxation Bureau combined with the situation of the rehearsal of the antigen to find and mobilized 75 party members to participate in volunteer services.  Xie Weijun, a member of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, and Zhou Haihang assisted the neighborhood committee to reasonably streamline 11 working groups including the propaganda, elimination, drug distribution, and material transportation involved in the current epidemic prevention and control. Meng Junlin, Secretary of the Interim Party Branch and the cadre of the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, led the public opinion propaganda group and the work meeting of the distribution group to sort out the workflow, clarify the division of labor, and connect them one by one to further improve the management of party volunteers.  On the day of the establishment of the Drug Group, the six party members volunteers participated in to help the points and medicines to come to the door. For the first time, the community established a system of eliminating the disinfecting group and the elimination of killing. For the first time, the community edited the ""Community Briefing"", which launched a short video reflecting the work of the community, and issued the epidemic prevention and control information and the guideline of the distribution.

Of the 260 cases of confirmation of the soil, 108 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 1 case was found in the screening of relevant risk personnel. 151 cases were asymptomatic infected from the confirmed case. Among the 4722 cases of asymptomatic infection, 4,660 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 62 cases were found in the screening of related risk personnel. As of 24:00 on the 3rd, 486 cases of severe patients received treatment at designated medical institutions and 95 cases of critical condition. There are 16 newly local death cases, with an average age of 82.9 years.  On the 3rd, there were a total of 12,435 closed -control areas in the city, involving 2.39 million people; 20,808 management and control areas, involving a population of 5.19 million; 47,861 prevention zones, involving a population of 15.78 million. After the near -stage ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening and corresponding prevention and control measures, the prevention and control effects have become increasingly apparent.  COVID-19 patients who have recently been recovered, and when the CT value of nucleic acid detection is ≥35, the sample cannot be separated from the activation virus. The Municipal Health and Health Commission clearly states that after the infected people are discharged from the standard (cabin), they are not included in the community screening objects. The home health monitoring does not need to conduct COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection or antigen test within 6 days. The CT value of the nucleic acid detection is less than 35, and immediately transfer to the isolation management of the designated hospital or the square -cabin hospital immediately. The test results do not affect the division of the ""three districts"" of the building and the community.

The centralized office site of the municipal organs is a place where the ""digital sentry"" was set up earlier. The reporter experienced the use of this new equipment yesterday. Within 1 second after scanning with the application code, the system shows the reporter's health code status, nucleic acid report, sampling time, scanning time and other information, and efficiently complete the visiting information verification and registration.  According to the person in charge of the Municipal Municipal Bureau of Management, at the beginning of March, the Municipal Machinery Management Bureau proposed the idea of developing the ""digital sentry"" based on the Shanghai epidemic situation, in order to improve the efficiency of health information verification of centralized office points and reduce the risk of cross -infection. Without this kind of informatization equipment, the gatekeeper must contact and check their information with many people every day, which is not only low efficiency, but also risk of virus transmission.  Can I integrate the ""digital sentry"" on the existing intelligent security system? Yunsai Zhilian Co., Ltd. has undertaken this task to connect this new type of device with the Shanghai Big Data Center, so that the data collected by the former can be transmitted to the big data pool in time.  From the formal task on March 23, to the preliminary development of the system on March 25, the Municipal Machinery Management Bureau and Yunsai Zhilian worked closely. The ""digital sentry"" of 3 municipal agencies settled in the centralized office site.  Yesterday, the reporter came to a centralized office site and saw a temperature measurement channel. After entering the channel, while receiving the temperature measurement of infrared body, according to the text prompts on the window, open the follow -up code in the mobile phone and place it on the code scanner. Within 1 second after scanning the code, the voice of ""verification passed"" came out. Subsequently, the reporter came to the gatekeeper and saw the software system connected to the code scanner. The system interface shows that nucleic acid negative reports are the test results sampled within 24 hours. In addition, information such as health code status and code scanning time is displayed on the interface.  In addition to the desktop ""digital sentry"" located in the temperature measurement channel, the handheld ""digital sentry"" has also been put into use. When the reporter interviewed, after seeing the car arrived at the door of the office point, the security personnel would hold a handheld ""digital sentry"" with a mobile phone size, and walked to the car and asked the driver to show the code. After reading, automatically check the nucleic acid report of the driver.  ""After the promotion of this kind of equipment in various key places in Shanghai, it can not only improve the efficiency and security of information testing, but also help the flow tone."" Personnel from key places such as banks, public venues, etc. will be recorded by ""digital sentry"" and summarized to Shanghai Big Data Center, which is very valuable for the current golden time for the current.  According to Yun Sai Zhilian, the ""digital sentry"" developed by the company has the function of ""six inspections"", which can also verify the site code of key places and the health code, itinerary, nucleic acid detection results, vaccination information and current body temperature of the people entering the place. Essence Compared with the ""place code"" that is also being promoted by Shanghai's key places, ""digital sentry"" is more friendly to the elderly and children who do not need smartphones. They can not only identify the application code, but also identify their ID cards and face. After presenting an ID card or a face recognition, the health information of citizens can be quickly verified.  It is reported that the ""Enterprise Reinstation"" and ""Enterprise Management"" platform developed by Yun Sai Zhilian will also be based on the needs of enterprises to resume work and re -production, and in terms of re -work guidance, self -examination of work, employee health pre -investigation, re -production plan management, place management and analysis, etc. Integration with the ""Digital Sentinel"" helps Shanghai's resumption of labor and re -production and normalization epidemic prevention and control.",Epidemic prevention and control; Shanghai;,

On March 26, the medical team of Tongji Hospital departed to the Fangchang Hospital of the Expo Exhibition Hall. Liu Yang, a digestive nurse born in July 2001, was the youngest.  After the epidemic, a group of young people transformed from a talked of ignorance student and transformed into a strong warrior. They practiced vows with action: as long as there is a need, they will top it at any time!  Wang Yuqin, a caregiver of the ""post -00s"", followed the medical team of 468 people in the Tenth People's Hospital of Shanghai to the New International Expo Center's square cabin hospital.

The fingers have been frozen, and the goggles do not know how many layers of layers have been found in the goggles. Water mist, he ignored it completely. When he handed over the work early the next morning, 780 patients had settled smoothly.  Many people still remember such a photo: a five -finger opened hand, thumb and index finger broke a big piece of skin, the skin of the fingers and palms was wrinkled and whitening ... This is because of a long -term because of a long -term long -term long -term The hand that was sampled in the rubber gloves was sampled and worn out. The owner of the hand was Luo Jiajun, a member of the Inspection Department of the Seventh People's Hospital, Luo Jiajun. One night, more than 10,000 nucleic acid testing specimens needed to be tested overnight. After 8 hours of uninterrupted cover and samples with colleagues, Luo Jiajun took off his gloves, only to find that the skin on his hand had ulcerated.

In the community, one of the main battlefields in the community, the young people used their enthusiasm, diligence, and optimism to become the guardians of the community and even the city.  In Chongwen Community, Malu Town, Jiading District, in early March, a community began to be closed. The youngest neighborhood committee provoked the heaviest burden at this time. Among the 7 members of this neighborhood committee, 5, including Director Pan Xiaoyu, had 5 ""post -90s"", the youngest was born in 1999. After closed management, they all lived in the office and were on duty for 24 hours. They answered the phone and returned to WeChat to solve the various problems of residents. They were busy until early in the morning. In Pan Xiaoyu's mobile phones, there are more than 30 residents and work groups.

After carrying anti -epidemic materials and participating in nucleic acid testing services again and again, Ni Jiahao, a member of the ""post -95s"" group, was so tired that he could not lift his hands, but when he saw the joy of residents who received life materials, he felt that he was bitter and tired. Essence  Since March, Zhu Hanjing, a master's degree in the 2020 care major of the Jiaotong University School of Medicine, has been doing volunteer services in the community. Not only does it participate in nucleic acid sampling, antigen distribution and recycling, but also helps residents solve a series of basic medical rescue needs, such as bandaging wounds, intravenous infusion, and infusion, and infusion, and Replace ureteralization, allergies, etc. During this period, she often couldn't care about eating and rest. She had to stay up late to study at home, but she didn't feel hard, because ""I should not hide in the face of difficulties. Society contributes its own power. ""  I can do it! Directors of each exhibition condense positive energy  Since the epidemic, many young people have adhered to the front line of their posts, carrying the burden of urban operations, and also using courage, professionalism, and confidence, showing that the young generation should have the strength, spirit, and responsibility.  The courier brother Wang Fei and several colleagues actively applied for the distribution volunteer of the epidemic prevention materials in the street and town. He transported masks, protective clothing, disinfection, mineral water, instant noodles and other supplies every day; ""post -95"" Liu Mengli, the webmaster of Ding Dong Buying Pengpu Station, insisted on not returning home for more than a month. He provided fresh supply services with sorting and distribution of more than 100,000 citizens three kilometers in a circle; The manager Li Na, in order to maintain the operation of convenience stores and continue to provide materials to the citizens, once lived in a shop without bed and no shower for 23 days; the 26 -year -old Shanghai Foreign Language University Polish teacher Zhao Yan, who moved in the early last month, moved in alone. The school's ""isolation area"", traveling to and from the hospital every day as a ""flash delivery staff"" to provide students with medicine ...  ""Try to the lips with your thumb, this is 'Dad'; with my index finger close to my lips, this is 'Mom' ..."" In ""Love Yun Tuo Ban"", the volunteer of Shanghai University of Foreign Languages Yang Tao is teaching Xiaoqian to ""speak"". Xiaoqian in the third grade this year is a child with a certain hearing impairment. Her mother is a medical staff who is fighting the front line of resistance. At present, more than 2,300 volunteers from 8 universities in Shanghai have enthusiastically signed up for custody services, and learned to make friends with the children of more than a thousand front -line people in the war.  Cancer patients who are about to disconnect, diabetic patients who cannot inject insulin, and epilepsy patients with medicinals ... The help sound in various corners of Shanghai gathered in an online document called ""Shanghai Medical Emergency Help"". On March 30, the junior students Hua Rongqi created this document, and hundreds of information in just a few days poured in. From the initial single fight to the convening of a volunteer team of more than 200 people, Huarongqi and partners across the country together collected and confirmed the help information of citizens. ""Shanghai is my own hometown, and I also want to help people in need."" In his eyes, behind each data is a person waiting for help. Every volunteer wants to work harder and efficiently.

During the ""post -00"" UP main Lahong Sang and roommates of more than 2.6 million fans at station B, they accidentally became ""Louchang"" during the separation of a community in Pudong.

We must always adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, and put medical treatment, especially patients with severe and critical illnesses in a more prominent position, play the role of multi -disciplinary teams, organize experts to consult, treat symptomatic treatment, and continuously optimize diagnosis and treatment methods and treatment methods. Do your best to improve the cure rate and the disease rate. It is necessary to continue to do personal protection, strictly decline the epidemic prevention measures, and resolutely prevent the hospital sense.  Subsequently, the city leaders went to Songjiang District to check the open business order of street supermarkets and pharmacies, and learn more about the implementation of the ""three districts"", especially the management and epidemic prevention requirements of the ""three districts"", especially the prevention of the management and epidemic prevention.

This village with only 0.8 square kilometers has 5 villagers and 39 companies, a total of more than 9,000 people, of which more than 7,900 foreign migrant workers. After the epidemic, the number of infections in the village remained high, with a maximum of 106 confirmed cases. Twelve grass -roots cadres who ""fire -saving"" everywhere have gradually been difficult to fight after more than 50 days of overloaded work.  At the same time, a tackling operation was also launched in Jiading District. The reinforcement team organized by the Party Committee of Jiangqiao Town was ordered to be ordered to go to the Fourth Village as soon as possible.  Working Group Aid  On the evening of April 18, the May 4th Village received multiple support. Including the working group, including the commander Zhang Guomin, including the point commander Zhang Guomin, the emergency assistance of the Village in Zengjian Village.  ""On the 18th, the test results of the total nucleic acid detection results of Zengjian Village, Jiangqiao Town were negative, which meant that we ended the 25 consecutive days of resident work. At about 7 pm that day, I received a call from the town party committee secretary and asked me to let me let me get me. Emergency assisted in the May 4th Village. ""Zhang Guomin said,"" At that time, everyone's body and psychology were very tired. However, it was impatient! ""Within half an hour, Zhang Guomin and his colleagues went straight to the Village.  ""A large number of work has exceeded the limit of the ability of an administrative village."" Gu Huajie, the first secretary of the Party Branch of the May 4th Village, said, ""Each village cadres are on the front line, and the person's handling is not the biggest difficulty."" After the dotted working group settled in, the stretched situation of the person's hand was greatly improved. In the next few days, the staff and volunteers on the point increased to 93 people, bringing confidence to the grassroots cadres and the masses of the grassroots villages.  In Zhang Guomin's view, after decades of overloaded work, the physical fitness and confidence of village cadres have reached the limit. As a point commander, he must cheer for his comrades and give them confidence. ""I usually run the marathon. I know the situation in the epidemic situation of the May 4th Village is like running a marathon. Now it has reached the most difficult"" hitting wall "". I constantly warn myself and team members, top, and then Top one, survive this limit, the end point is in front of you, and the victory is ahead. ""Zhang Guomin said,"" We work hard to work hard, and the villagers look in the eyes. When we walk on the street every day, we have always giving the villagers confidence, At this time, confidence is more important than gold. ""  Speak with data  ""After our station, the first thing is to set up a data analysis group to touches the information of the whole village and analyze all data."" Zhang Guomin said, ""Unlike pure agricultural areas such as Zengjian Village, this is Jiangqiao Town In the largest village in the city, there are a large number of enterprise factories in the village, and there is a dormitory in the factory. There are a large number of tenants living here, and the personnel structure is complicated. We must master the difficulties as soon as possible to make effective rights in time. ""  To this end, the working group is equipped with a staff member who is familiar with data analysis to make dynamic information production daily newspapers. After the first newspaper was released, according to the actual situation, the working group subdivided all the work into 11 working groups including the command group, the living security group, the nucleic acid detection group, the material security group, and the logistics support group. , Carry out village -level epidemic prevention work.  ""Practice data analysis is very important for research and judging the trend of the epidemic. For data analysis every day, what is the trend of the epidemic, where the cases appear, the cause of the occurrence, and where the loopholes will be clear to take remedial measures."" The 11 working groups meet every day, communicate with work gains and losses, and discuss to improve work methods.  Establish a new order  With the working group station, the May 4th Village has gradually gained new order.  80%of the villagers' residence in May 4th Village did not have independent bathrooms, and the kitchen was shared. There are a total of 5 public toilets in the village, which has become the focus of epidemic prevention. ""After the working group stationed, we proposed several plans. For example, each one was distributed to the plastic toilet, used in time, and arranged volunteers to disinfect all the weather."" Gu Huajie introduced. In the end, the village decided to adopt the strictest public toilet management method: 5 public toilets in the village house, each arranged for 2 people for 24 hours to guard, and each person who went to the toilet went in and disinfected twice. Clean and clean at any time.  ""Although this is troublesome, it is the most effective and reliable way of management at the moment."" Gu Huajie said, ""Through communication with the villagers, this method also alleviates the anxiety of the villagers' hearts in the epidemic situation.""  In addition, one of the 12 conventions issued by the working group requires strict disinfection and disinfecting, and a large -scale disinfecting of the village house environment every day in the afternoon in the afternoon. After the transfer -related personnel, the professional elimination team will also enter the corridor and the room to eliminate and disinfect. Each household in the village is distributed to a nozzle and a bottle of disinfection slices, which eliminate at any time; in terms of garbage management, the cleaner in the village house cleans the road 2 times a day, clear the garbage 4 times, and do a good job of domestic garbage and disinfecting work. Essence  Set your hands  With the help of the working group, the things that several village cadres had did not have any energy to do at all were re -be put on the agenda.  ""For example, communicate with villagers, coordinate the killing of key areas and the clearing of garbage, and do ideological work for villagers who are unwilling to transfer to the village ..."" Gu Huajie said, ""The villagers do not cooperate from the unknown anxiety and panic And puzzle. After clarifying the staff and refining the division of labor, grassroots cadres have more time and energy to do the ideological work of the masses. ""  What made Gu Huajie remember that a 10 -year -old child was closed and controlled in the village house with his grandparents, while his parents were controlled in another community. Unfortunately, the old man was diagnosed with positive, because he was worried about the child, and the old man insisted on not going to the square hospital. To this end, he contacted the children's parents, communities and designated hospitals. After setting up everything, this successfully persuaded the two elderly people to go to the square hospital.  At present, Jiangqiao Town has arranged a total of 5 ""unplugged"" working groups. 32 districts and town cadres have penetrated into May 4th Village, Xinghuo Village, Fuyou Jiayuan, Jiangqiao Second Village, and Da Mangfeng Fancheng.

Pudong, Pudan and adjacent areas will be closed at 5 am the next day. Chen Aihua missed it, leaving her for more than 8 hours.  Chen Aihua is the general manager of the Shanghai Institute of Architectural Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Jianke""). Their big customers. Chen Aihua believes that long -term stable and timely supply is the key to maintaining customers.  But this time, the situation is unprecedented: the Jinshan District where the factory is located is just a few hours later.  The product must be transported out of Jinshan District before the sealing control. She is remotely logged in to the company's production delivery system at home. The recent order demand for downstream customers and the supply capacity of upstream are unobstructed on the computer screen. According to this information, she immediately arranged the vehicle to use the sealing time difference between the two sides of the Huangpu River (Pudi 4 days in the evening), and transferred some stocks in the Jinshan District factory to Puxi to prepare to send it to customers in the near future.  After all this, less than 2 am the next day. There are about 3 hours from the Jinshan District.  With a short period of time and remotely to complete this series of work, Chen Aihua attributed to the company's digital transformation. She said: ""The upstream and downstream data are gathered on the digital viewing board. After the epidemic, we can predict that the risks that may occur in the later stage of the industrial chain can be predicted to increase the reserves and finished stocks.""  The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 epidemic has further accelerated the digital transformation of the enterprise. Not only Jianke, a large number of enterprises have gone out of similar trajectories. A global survey by McKinsey Consulting showed that within a few months after the epidemic began, the digitalization process of enterprises accelerated for 3 to 4 years. McKinsey believes that the epidemic is an accelerator, and all existing trends will be accelerated by the epidemic, and those who live first are digitalization.  Digitalization brings toughness  As early as 2020 COVID-19 outbreaks, many companies began a digital transformation. The original intention was to solve their respective pain points, as well as the construction of the family. From 2010 to 2013 was a peak of the national construction industry, and the product anti -pendant safety inner security instrument was in short supply. ""Product supply is in short supply, it sounds particularly good, but it is actually very painful -the labor force cannot be found, and the equipment cannot be bought."" Chen Aihua said. ""After the peak of the construction industry, it is a periodic trough, which leads to excess employees and equipment.""  How to resist the uncertainty caused by the ups and downs of the industry? The plan of the Jianke is intelligent and digital. In 2018, Jianke established an intelligent factory in Jinshan District to develop a robot -based automation workstation and a smart processing production line based on machine vision. Today, 1 worker can manage 31 equipment for 5 production lines, while traditional models need 13 people.  Cooperate with intelligent manufacturing is the digital management system. Through the digital twin management platform, online and offline staff seamlessly link. Even at home office, information can be monitored in real -time viewing of the equipment in the digital viewing board. Like the cyclical ups and downs of the construction industry, the epidemic in the past two years has been repeated, which has also brought uncertainty to enterprise production. ""The epidemic has caused the communication in physical space to be blocked. How to remedy? Use information technology to break physical isolation. Therefore, as long as there is a need to improve the efficiency of collaboration between people, there is a need for digital transformation."" Professor Zhang Cheng, director of the Business Intelligence Department, said.  With digital tools, management, production, online and offline are highly synergistic. During the epidemic, Jianke can maintain factory operation as only a few workers in the workshop, and other employees can work remotely. The company's production capacity increased by 65%, and the toughness of resistance to fluctuations has also increased.  Digitalization is not born for the epidemic, but during the epidemic, he showed his skills.  The only way for future development  ""After the outbreak, our users' demand for non -contact or digital systems has increased significantly."" Huang Meng, director of the Industrial Internet Innovation Center of Shanghai Electric Group Digital Technology Co., Ltd., also observed this change.  Huang Meng is responsible for a industrial Internet platform called ""Xingyun Zhihui"". This platform manages 150,000 high -end equipment and energy equipment, and realizes the aggregation of equipment information, coordinated, and remote monitoring. Taking wind power equipment as an example, after accessing ""Xingyun Zhihui"", the fan can remotely monitor and operate and maintain. The epidemic reduces personnel flow, and managers may not be able to reach the scene. Huang Meng said: ""Even so, they can understand the status of the equipment through the"" Nebula Zhihui "". Therefore, the impact of the epidemic has been reduced to the minimum."" In the past one or two years, domestic power production companies are accelerating the introduction or optimization of similarity. Smart energy monitoring system.  In terms of communication with customers, the epidemic has also accelerated the progress of digital transformation. Hai Li Electric is an enterprise producing refrigeration equipment compressor, with factories in Shanghai, Nanchang, Mianyang, and India. Li Yilong, executive vice president of Hai Li Electric, said that there were many face -to -face exchanges with customers, but after the epidemic, product introduction, technical solution introduction, etc. all turned to online. What the product is like, you can also dynamically demonstrate it to customers.  Digital online marketing has made some companies taste sweet. Starting a few years ago, the marketing system of SAIC Chase started digital transformation. Through the ""Spider Customization"" platform, users can enjoy intelligent customization functions such as online options, online selection dealers, calendar booking, order tracking, and deposit payment. Although the epidemic was aggressive, with digital tools, SAIC Chase's marketing in March this year was hardly affected.  ""Previously, companies usually believe that digitalization can save costs, but it cannot directly create sales value, and market sales can generate direct returns. Therefore, small and medium -sized enterprises usually do not use digitalization as a high priority decision.

What is the development of the epidemic in these countries after relaxation and control?  Tang Bei: Taking the United States as an example, it has just canceled the regulations for mandatory wearing masks on the plane. Although there are still differences in the specific practices, it has completely relaxed the epidemic prevention policy. In fact, the United States does not recommend individuals to cancel all epidemic prevention measures, but it transferred the responsibility of preventing the crisis of hygiene to individuals, requiring individuals to evaluate risks and make decisions by themselves.  Such an epidemic prevention strategy will inevitably bring a result -due to the differences in individual social and economic conditions, the ability to prevent infection, and the level of medical services after infection will be completely different. Some people wrote that there was a so -called public health ""isolation system"" in the United States. Facing the public health crisis, the situation of rich people and poor people had a huge division.  The number of cases in the United States has also recently risen, from an increase of 10,000 cases in early April this year to more than 60,000 cases daily. As the test and case reports are also relaxed accordingly, the real situation of the epidemic may be underestimated. Senior officials in the White House have been infected, which also shows that the spread of its domestic epidemic is relatively high.  Comprehensive consideration of multiple factors  Reporter: Why can't China choose ""lying flat""?  Tang Bei: Adhering to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is still the so-called ""lying flat"". This is not a simple choice question, but to comprehensively consider a series of factors behind it.  First, China's population base is large, and the high degree of development of transportation and logistics industry is a high -liquidity society as a whole. Once the epidemic prevention policy is liberalized, the virus will quickly burn and spread like wildfire.  Second, my country's per capita medical resources are limited, and the gap between urban and rural areas and regions is large. You know, after some developed countries relax and prevent epidemic prevention, even if the medical resources are relatively sufficient, the number of COVID-19 deaths still inevitably increase. On average, the number of ICU beds per 100,000 people in my country is much lower than that of developed countries. Once ""lying"" is ""lying"", it is easy to cause medical resources for crowding.  Third, the issue of immunization rate. Domestic surviving COVID-19 vaccine can effectively prevent severe illnesses and deaths, but it should be seen that the rate of vaccination rates in elderly people, patients with basic diseases and children is not high. Many people fail to timely due to various reasons. Out of inoculation. The absolute quantity of these groups of people and the stacked medical resources crowding may cause a lot of death. The number of deaths is not the number of cold, but the members of the family. When the mortality rate rises, many ""family cells"" will become unstable, which is the price we cannot bear.  On the other hand, after the epidemic prevention is relaxed, will the socio -economic recovery and return completely? From the perspective of foreign situations, this is not necessarily the case. Imagine that if the outside virus is rampant, there will be a very high risk of infection when you go out. How many people will go out for consumption, activities, and travel? Therefore, it is not to say that the control is liberalized. Some costs brought by the existing prevention and control policy will disappear naturally, and in fact it may continue to exist.  The formulation of public health policies needs to be considered from a comprehensive and systematic perspective. Choosing ""lying flat"" at this stage is very likely to cause a series of risks, which is very dangerous to my country.  Maximum protection of elderly groups  Reporter: Most of the severe cases and death cases recently announced in Shanghai are the elderly and are accompanied by serious basic diseases. In the face of the epidemic impact, such people are actually quite fragile.  Tang Bei: Yes, combined with my country's realistic and objective conditions, ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a policy choice to maximize the protection of elderly groups.  From the perspective of affinity, culture, and spirit, elderly groups have important positions in Chinese families. If the elderly group is impacted by the epidemic, a large -scale infection and death in a short period of time may cause the turbulence and impact of social and economic levels.  The formulation of any public health policy has both technical considerations and support of political concepts. China has the responsibility to protect fragile groups and elderly people, so that everyone has the right to health-I think this is the fundamental concept behind the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Of course, after clarifying the goal, how to find the best path to achieve this goal requires continuous thinking and optimization. For example, considering the current development of the epidemic, we must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, and be good at communicating with the masses.  Reporter: From the perspective of global public health governance, what is the significance of the epidemic prevention and control measures taken by my country?  Tang Bei: COVID-19 virus itself is still evolving and mutation, and its evolution direction is unknown. The future trend of the global epidemic depends on the two aspects of virus evolution and the international community's response. Therefore, the international community must unite to fight the epidemic.  From the perspective of international politics and global health governance, China's prevention and control measures are very important, and the determination to continue to control the epidemic has been firmly controlled worldwide. In addition, China has a huge population base. Once the virus spreads, the chance of further evolution of the virus has also changed. The consequences will be unavailable.  All in all, we need to make a more comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 virus. At this stage, China has adopted the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. It is based on the prudent attitude adopted by China's national conditions, and it is also a manifestation of global anti-epidemic prospects.",elderly group; population base;,

Therefore, we can maximize the scope of the impact of epidemic conditions and minimize infection, severe illnesses, and death, which reflects the highest humanitarianism, which is beyond doubt. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" without hesitation.  Reporter: How to understand ""Dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Mao Shi'an: Personally, there are two levels of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". First, Zero-Covid is a strategic goal and the basic idea. We must adhere to it, and do not hesitate to shake. Second, dynamic is a means and a method, a tactics. At the level of specific measures and practices, it is necessary to continue to adjust, and to understand, accurately, and comprehensively understand, and implement the general policy of dynamic Zero-Covid.  In the process of implementing dynamic Zero-Covid, I am repeatedly thinking: dynamic Zero-Covid, first, what? Second, how to clear it? I understand, ""What is clear"" is layered. The first level is the COVID-19 mortality, the second level, is the severe rate, the third level is the positive infection rate, and it is also the object of our ""acceptance"". Therefore, we must put the medical treatment work in the prominent position. According to the ninth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, we classify the patients in a realistic thing, adhere to the category and treat, prevent mild diseases, critical illness, concentrate their strengths, and go all out to treat patients with intensive illness patients. , Topic to reduce the mortality of the disease. At the same time, strict measures such as home isolation should be quickly improved and the spread of the epidemic should be effectively blocked in order to protect the lives of the people's lives and health.  If the city metaphorized the adult body, the test of this epidemic test was not only the overall health status of the city and the functions of various organs, but to the peripheral nerves and capillaries, and reached each small blood microcirculation. We must pay close attention to the unimpeded microcirculation of cities. Among them, there are several types of disadvantaged groups that need special attention, such as elderly people, high -risk patients, children, maternal women, etc.; Special groups in cities, such as high -risk courier personnel, migrant workers who live in the same place, long -term long -term College students closed in colleges and universities, etc., need to relieve their urgent need, properly resettle, and further care about their physical and mental health. In addition, there are the protection of the daily life of chai oil and salt, and so on.  Reporter: What aspects can they strengthen at present?  Mao Shi'an: This wave of nervous resistance has caused a lot of psychological shocks. Therefore, it is necessary to fully popularize the scientific knowledge about the virus, so that citizens have a correct understanding of the harmfulness of the virus. Emphasizing that epidemic prevention must be personal hygiene ""three pieces"" and ""five more"", not only pay attention to, and don't panic. Once the panic of the virus exceeds the actual harm of the virus, it will cause more serious secondary disasters. On the one hand, we need to understand the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" in science, accuracy, and comprehensiveness, and it is not shaken; on the other hand, we must ""improve the new characteristics of virus mutation, improve scientific precision prevention and control skills"", and continue to keep constantly Adjust the specific practices, and become strict and defensive as strict guardianship, so that the implementation measures and methods of dynamic ZERO-COVID are dynamic.  Literature is human learning, medicine is benevolence. Under the guidance of the highest value pursuit and important thoughts of ""people's supremacy, life first"", persist in humanistic care and humanitarianism in every aspect of resistance, ensure good medical needs, and do a good job of ""rice bags"", ""vegetable baskets"" and so on. The supply of daily necessities, strive to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, and minimize the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development.  Recently, I also saw and heard many moving stories around me. In these difficult and ordinary days, 25 million Shanghai people, with the cooperation of patience, persistence, and mutual understanding, write the nobleness of human nature. We believe that under the strong leadership of the party and the government, unity is united, and Shanghai will definitely ""return to normal.""",The total policy; Mao Shi'an; the people first;,

My brother who has been suffering from epilepsy has been broken for two days, and there have been obvious symptoms of discomfort. The necessary medicine for online shopping last month is now ""sealed"" at the express transit station, and she is in the sealing community ... Worry. The neighborhood committee couldn't get through the phone. She remembered the community police who had previously made a conversation. With the mentality of trying, she called Huang Wenjie's phone.  In the past month, similar help calls and information, Huang Wenjie, police of Zhuangxing Police Station of Fengxian Public Security Branch, received many every day. The epidemic prevention and control tasks are heavy, and the grassroots staff of the community are in the high pressure period for full load operation. Some ""empty"" will appear: the life of the elderly and disadvantaged groups in the community is not fully cared for. It is difficult to solve it in time, and even the residents of the community to go downstairs to test how to bring the key to the door. So ""Huang Wenjie"" stood up.  ""We will do our best to help solve the actual difficulties of the masses."" In the special period of prevention and control of the Shanghai epidemic, the city's public security organs have formed more than 1,100 ""community help pioneers"", and community cadres, property personnel, building group leaders, volunteers, volunteers, and volunteers Wait for a ""special group"" to actively solve the problem of ""urgency and sorrow"" of the masses. As of now, the Pioneer team has visited more than 230,000 times, and has resolved more than 80,000 practical difficulties.  Open the passage to ensure the needs of the masses  ""For patients with epilepsy, lack of medicine is a major event."" Late at night on April 24, when I received a call from Ms. Long, Huang Wenjie was very worried: ""This busy must help.""  In the early morning of the next day, the drug -seeking operation immediately began. According to the information provided by Ms. Long, Huang Wenjie inquired about the person in charge of the Shentong Express Station. ""The person in charge of the site is also very good, and is willing to help this. But the site sorters live in the closed management community. First of all, they have to pick up people."" Huang Wenjie first checked the report of the employee nucleic acid test, and then lived with the employees. The streets and neighborhood committees in the place where the site is located explained. After the process came down, after the procedures were complete, he put on a protective suit, drove a police car to pick up people, and went to the express station to find the express mail that was urgently needed.  However, things are not so smooth. Just when Huang Wenjie and the sorters were courmed, Ms. Long's phone came again. She apologized evenly, saying that the customer service was wrong, it should be Yuantong Express, and the site was in Nanqiao. ""So big oolong."" Huang Wenjie thought, but on the phone, he comforted Ms. Long, ""It's okay, I can find it again and can find it.""  The difference between the word means that the morning is busy, and all the processes must be from the beginning. But Huang Wenjie was not annoyed. The work experience of the community police for more than 20 years gave him enough patience and good temper.  Huang Wenjie immediately contacted the head of Yuantong's site. The good news is that there are two sorters in this courier station stationed in the warehouse, and there is no need to go as in the morning.  Without taking lunch, Huang Wenjie rushed to the site of Yuantong Express. The two courier was looking for Ms. Dragon's express. ""There are more than 40,000 courier in that site, and the medicine is a small box. It is not easy to find it from it."" After Huang Wenjie joined, the three bent down and picked it up in the pile of express. After much, Ms. Long's express was finally found.  Thanks to the two courier, holding the courier box, Huang Wenjie got into the police car, and drove straight to the community where Ms. Dragon lived. At this time, it was 3 pm. After arriving in the community, Huang Wenjie told Ms. Long to dispel the express packaging first, and then disassembled it for a while. Ms. Long also apologized and thanked. ""Actually, the most thanks to the courier, they are more hard.""  ""Each box of medicine is the heart pill of patients, which can help residents solve difficulties."" In an interview with reporters, Huang Wenjie said.  Difficulty in medical treatment, difficulty in applying medicine, and special periods for preventing and controlling the epidemic, these contradictions are particularly prominent. Focusing on the urgent demand for the protection of medical treatment, medicine and medicine, and other drugs, Fengxian Public Security formed a ""three -car guard"" covering cross -regional direct vehicles, mobile medicine vehicles, and mobile medical vehicles, and opened two cross -district "" Seeking medical medicine ""channel"" channel. Since March 28, the Fengxian public security department has provided cross -district medical protection services for 624 people.  Find out the bottom number and care about special groups in all aspects  Fengxian has both rural areas and new cities. When the community is closed, special groups such as elderly people, disabled, and maternal women in different regions will encounter different difficulties and needs, and they need more protection and care.  ""There are many rural areas in our jurisdiction. There are 154 elderly people living alone in the village, of which more than 40 are over 80 years old. Most of them will not use smartphones, let alone grab food and group buying."" Community closed management At the beginning, Yao Zhiping, director of the Lilin Police Station, focused on these elderly people.  According to the arrangements formulated in the early stage, the police of the police station and the staff of the residential village committee regularly visited the elderly to understand their needs of life, medical treatment, medication and other needs, and managed to raise the living materials and medicines needed by the elderly in the shortest time. The police station also deliberately arranged the police to help the elderly and their families and children regularly video calls to relieve the loneliness of the elderly.  Newborn babies who always bring hope to people are inevitable in the special period of prevention and control of the epidemic. There are many newborn babies in the tube section of Qi Xian's police station. ""My own children are still young, and I understand the urgency of parents very much.""  On April 3, Zhang Xiaobo first counted the needs of newborn baby families in the owner's group for the first time. It was found that the number of types of types was different, so he made a detailed list of items to buy it at the maternal and baby shop. However, there are no brands and models. He communicated with the clerk and confirmed with Bao Da Bao's mom while calling. ""For the first time, I took the"" big order ""of the running leg."" At that time, Zhang Xiaobo bought it for more than an hour, and finally bought all the items, drove to house to the household.  ""Baby supplies are consumed quickly. I go to the mother and baby shop every week to purchase, and I have rich experience."" Zhang Xiaobo said with a smile, it felt like I was a ""novice dad.""  To provide protection and care for special groups, we must first know who they are and where they live. Since the start of the epidemic prevention and control work, the Fengxian public security department relying on the forces of the streets, villages and towns, and communities, and comprehensively sorted out the number of people and groups that need special care in the area in the area, and together with the cadres of the residential village committees, set up door -to -door meetings, telephone visit, family members, neighbors, neighbors, and neighbors. Ask the ""four -in -one"" contact system to ensure that special groups can spend this special period steadily.  Screen corner, help the ignored group  The eyes of the ""community to help the pioneer team"" are not only focused on the community. ""Where there is need, we will appear."" This is not just a promise that stays oral, but also the guidance of specific actions.  On April 18, the police at the Touqiao Police Station found that a stray staff Xiao Yang lived under the cross -line bridge of the Daha Highway. He came to Shanghai from his hometown in February this year and worked in a factory in the Daxian Touqiao area. Originally, he rented a room near the factory, but was affected by the epidemic at the end of March. The factory stopped working. Xiao Yang had no income and could only check out and live in a bridge hole. In the early spring, the temperature difference between day and night was large, and Xiao Yang had only one bed. She was used as a bed with a hard paper board picked up by the road. Before being discovered by the police, he ate instant noodles every day to fill his hunger, but for a long time, the instant noodles and drinking water were almost exhausted, and the mobile phone was completely out of power. He could only curl up in the bridge hole every day.  After the police reported Xiao Yang's situation, he prepared foods such as fruits and biscuits for Xiao Yang for the first time, giving him a protective suit, and providing antigen test agents. The results were negative. After a short rest, the police helped Xiao Yang to compile his personal items and take him to receive nucleic acid testing. That night, after completing the relevant rescue procedures and obtaining the test report, the police sent Xiao Yang to the rescue point properly.  Shipmen, construction site workers, card drivers ... The lives of these people in a special period are even more difficult, but they are easily overlooked. Since the prevention and control of this round of epidemic, Fengxian Public Security has discovered and rescued 133 residents with no residents, helping to set up a nucleic acid detection point uniformly to set up more than 153 crew members who stayed in the waters of Fengxian, and distribute living materials to the crew members. ; For a large number of card -lipped drivers who stay, the first highway nucleic acid detection point and mobile detection point are set up in the city with the Health Department to assist in the testing certificate, ensure that the driver goes out of Shanghai smoothly, and provide living materials such as temporary stranded drivers with living materials and other guarantees.

(Reporter Meng Qunshu) Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a member of the State Council from April 27th to 28th, emphasized when investigating and guiding the epidemic prevention and control of the epidemic in Shanghai. The Party Central Committee and the State Council decision-making deployment, adhered to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation, unsupering tackling, strictly prevent rebounds, quickly and effectively promoted the social Zero-Covid, and won the battle against this epidemic as soon as possible.

On the morning of the 28th, Sun Chunlan came to a construction site in the West Hongqiao Business District of Qingpu District to check the situation of closed -loop management and gathering epidemic disposal of the construction site. Exchanges. Sun Chunlan pointed out that it is necessary to compact the ""four -party responsibility"", timely popularize protection knowledge from construction site personnel, and use the incentive restraint mechanism to ensure that the construction of the construction site is in place. It is necessary to use the nucleic acid to detect this gold standard, strengthen the investigation and transfer isolation, grasp the small early, do a good job of cleaning and disinfecting, and promote the Zero-Covid as soon as possible.

From the perspective of community governance, how to understand the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy?  Tang Youcai: The difficulty of preventing and controlling Omikon virus is that it has strong hiddenness and fast transmission. Therefore, the epidemic prevention and control must be quickly improved to form an efficient community mobilization system. Adhering to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", the core is the understanding of ""dynamic"". ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not simply pursuing zero infection, not one-size-fits-all sealing, nor is it equivalent to all nucleic acid testing.  As far as community prevention and control is concerned, the core of ""dynamic"" is to achieve flexible switching in different states of the epidemic situation, establish a hierarchical response mechanism for epidemic prevention and control at the community level, and optimize the specific operation methods of the three district management. For example, when mobilization needs to be mobilized, it orders to gather quickly, and after the epidemic is relieved, it can quickly restore normal life.  Reporter: How to implement the guiding ideology of ""people first and life first"" in community governance?  Tang Youcai: China's epidemic prevention and control adheres to the guiding ideology of ""people first, life first"", and the first is to protect the fragile groups from being impacted by the virus. The prevention and control of the epidemic is a means, not the purpose.  In the process of preventing and controlling the community epidemic, different coping methods and governance capabilities have a completely different effect. Communities with good governance have suppressed the spread of the virus in the community, promoted the formation of the community community, and enhanced the healthy interaction between the neighborhood committees and residents. There are also various communities due to the simple and rigidity of the epidemic prevention and control work, leading to various problems in residents.  Reporter: From your practice, what are the specific reflection of a good group defense and group governance mechanism?  Tang Youcai: This epidemic prevention and control has greatly changed the community volunteer service situation. Some young residents with ability, willingness, and public minds have become a living force for volunteer services and injected new energy and methods into community work. Some communities have formed a volunteer service architecture of ""General Party Branch of the residential district -core volunteers -motor volunteers -community residents"", which is also a positive factor for the prevention and control of the epidemic to community governance.  The ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy means that the community epidemic prevention and control work is normalized in the future. Therefore, community volunteer services are not temporary and short-term, but normal and sustainable. Community transformation governance methods will be included in the community governance system from various types of people, including party members, volunteers, professionals and other volunteer service forces, and achieve the healthy development of community volunteer services through participating governance methods.  Reporter: How does community governance provide effective support for ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Tang Youcai: The prevention and control of the epidemic is also an information war and public opinion war. In the process of preventing and controlling the epidemic, residents need to understand the information of the confirmed diagnosis, sealing and controlling buildings, and supplies of materials in this community. Once the information is blocked, the rumors will be breed. The community must believe in the masses. We have seen that some communities rely on various online and offline platforms, and through community tabloids, daily newspapers and other methods, inform them of the information that residents pay attention to, eliminate residents' doubts and form a positive public opinion atmosphere.  Reporter: From the perspective of community governance and group defense and group governance, what experience can play a role in ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Tang Youcai: First, he always believes in the masses and establishes a transparent and timely community information disclosure mechanism. The second is to be good at organizing the masses and forming a normalized mechanism for community volunteer services. The third is to efficiently mobilize the masses and establish a governance process of organic combination and flexible switching. The fourth is to enhance the health awareness and public consciousness of residents. Fifth, dare to face the masses and resolve community contradictions in the bud state. Sixth, it is to serve the masses meticulously and improve the refined service system for special groups. In particular, we must establish a database of key groups, be good at connecting external resources, encourage the community to form a mutual aid network, and establish and improve the refined service system for special groups.  The epidemic has a great impact on the lives of residents. Testing the role and governance of grass -roots cadres must be tested. The community must face challenges, not afraid of contradictions, and avoid problems. In the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", the community can learn from the practice of ""Fengqiao Experience"" in the new era, facing the demands and opinions of the masses, do a good job of soothing and interpretation, introduce professional social work forces, and be good at mining and cultivating grassroots mediation at the grassroots level. The team of members has won the recognition of residents through a sincere attitude, professional methods and meticulous work, thereby forming a community of social governance community that ""everyone is responsible, everyone is responsible, and everyone enjoys everyone.""",General policy; volunteer service; community governance; group prevention group treatment; epidemic prevention and control;,

The reporter was informed that since the beginning of March, Zhongshan Hospital has been responsible for the preparation, management and treatment of two designated treatment (backup) hospitals and two centralized isolation and treatment venues (of which the original Xuhui Caobao Road centralized isolation treatment site Transfer to the Shandong Medical Team). As of April 26, the three institutions have opened a total of 2,657 beds. So far, 8,837 patients and asymptomatic infected patients have been treated. 6,278 were discharged.  The amount of some outpatient clinics is the same as the epidemic, and the emergency treatment increases by 40 %  During the epidemic, Zhongshan Hospital formed a total of 100 emergency reserve medical teams, with a sense of reserve hospitals and more than 800 logistics staff and 438 nucleic acid sampling teams. Data show that from March 1st to April 26th, Zhongshan Hospital completed more than 1.37 million patients, medical staff, community residents and guarantee task nucleic acid testing.  During the static management of the whole region, how can we continue to maintain the needs of citizens? The hospital adheres to outpatient blood transparency, outpatient and chemotherapy, and the need for medical treatment for patients with weight and major diseases. The daily reservation of outpatient chemotherapy is more than 100, which is basically the same as before the epidemic.  With the implementation of the ""three districts"" implementation of differentiation and controlling control and control management, from April 18th, the outpatient clinic of all departments will be adhered to, and doctors will be sent in real time according to the number of people who visit today. In order to create a safe diagnosis and treatment environment for both doctors and patients, the outpatient clinic has comprehensively improved the protection level of outpatient staff, and further increases the frequency of environmental elimination. Before the clinic and after the clinic, all outpatient areas must be performed. Nucleic acid testing is not included on April 18, and the outpatient volume has reached 8095.

Transportation service. ""Said the person in charge of the Shanghai Environmental Solid Department of Shanghai City Investment.  The rectification of the vehicle that spanned 1700 kilometers is injecting powerful kinetic energy into the treatment of Shanghai Medical Waste. The reporter learned from Shanghai City Investment that since this round of epidemic, the amount of medical waste has risen, and the disposal volume has also increased from 300 tons per day to more than 1,400 tons per day. Essence  How does the increased medical waste disappear safely?  Fully expand the transportation team  Disposal medical waste is the last ring on the epidemic prevention chain, involving a wide range of aspects, covering, transportation, and disposal. Shanghai City has undertaken the main task of Shanghai's garbage collection and transportation disposal. Only the Shanghai environment of the Shanghai environment has undertaken more than 6,700 medical institutions in the city, 39 fixed -point hospitals, 185 square -cabin hospitals, totaling 379,300 beds of incatient waste disposal In addition, there are 76 centralized isolation points, 10 port concentrated residence points, and the output of Hongqiao, Pudong Airport International Flights and Shanghai Port International Sailing Ship.  Starting in March, the number of positive cases has risen rapidly. According to the changes in the collection and transportation of immune -related waste and the ability of medical waste emergency response, Shanghai City Investment has continuously improved emergency response levels to ensure that the city's medical waste should be collected, it should be rotated, and Nissan's Nissan Riqing.  If the production waste point and the waste incineration plant are nodes for this medical waste disposal, then receiving is a line that connects each node. It can cover the entire city. Or missing. The relevant person in charge of the Shanghai Environment told reporters that on March 11, all the manufacturers and managers of the subordinate solid waste disposal companies have returned to their jobs, and the entire factory enters a closed -loop management state. In order to ensure the normal operation of the first -line team, a special special class of medical waste emergency services has also been established.  Many employees take the initiative to apply to join the receiving team. Fang Chengzhong, the customer service of the Medical Scrap Branch, saw an emergency recruitment notice. He had experienced the experience of driving in medical waste vehicles. From the Jiading base to the old port base, 250 kilometers, he set off at 18:00, returned to the company in the early morning of the next day, and took 4 hours after rest, and continued to invest in his job.  Even so, due to the rapid growth of the output of immune -related waste, the front -line team is in a super load working state. From April 14th to April 20th, nearly 300 medical waste receiving vehicles were dispatched, with a mileage of nearly 60,000 kilometers per day.  ""As of now, our"" Special Team ""has adhered to the post for nearly 50 days, and their average age is more than 45 years old, which is the backbone of the entire transportation system."" The 176 -receiving personnel accepted the routine medical waste and isolation points of the daytime, and went to collect the immune -related garbage at night. The daily workload increased from two trips to three trips. Often, he departed in the early morning and returned to the factory late at night. Because of the protection of the protective service, everyone wears ""urine is not wet"", and try not to eat as much as possible at work to reduce the number of penetration and off the number of times.  Square cabin garbage dynamic zero-covid  As the city's large and small square -cabin hospitals have been opened one after another, many people have begun to care about. Can the immune -related waste produced from the squares produced safely, will it affect the surrounding residents? The reporter learned from Shanghai City Investment that for the square cabin hospitals and isolation points, medical waste emergency services have been set up to ensure that the information between the waste production waste and the receiving team is unobstructed.  Prior to the use of the square cabin hospital, the medical waste collection process was determined. Knowing that a city -level cabin hospital in Jinshan District started immediately, the special team members were stationed in the management headquarters of this square cabin hospital to provide a 24 -hour ""housekeeper"" service for the on -site operation team. Where is the garbage in the square cabin hospital, how to install, and how to eliminate the disinfecting, it is very particular. The team members have assisted the operation team to improve the storage and clearance specifications of immune -related garbage, and scientifically delineate storage venues according to the actual layout.  There are hidden safety hazards in immune -related garbage, and each procedure is not available. The special classes also need to help the square cabin hospital to establish a three -party communication mechanism of ""property, hospitals, receiving and transportation"", grasp the abolition of waste, and form a ""five -fixed"" working standard for ""timing, fixed -point, fixed -person, car, and fixed route.""  As of now, this special class with the main ""post -90s"" has established a good communication and coordination mechanism with more than 100 squares and isolation points to open up the ""first"" mark of the collection and transportation. The members drove thousands of kilometers a day. According to the daily immune -related waste inventory rate of each point, the ""red, yellow and green"" three -level inventory warning response mechanism was the first.

It gives full play to the enthusiasm of all aspects. The epidemic prevention and control fights and resumes strong support for normal production and living order as soon as possible.  In order to further facilitate citizens to conduct nucleic acid testing, Shanghai is using the combination of ""fixed sampling point+citizen sampling point+flow sampling point"" to accelerate the construction of normal nucleic acid sampling points in the city. Li Qiang came to Changning District to check the setting of the normalized nucleic acid sample point on the spot to make a deep understanding of the sampling point layout, personnel equipment equipment, and detection ability matching. Li Qiang pointed out that accelerating the laying of normalized nucleic acid sampling points and accelerating the ability to improve nucleic acid sampling detection capabilities is very important for the current epidemic prevention and control initiative and orderly restoring normal production and living order. In the urgent sense of urgency, aiming at the target requirements and actual needs, we must have a strong energy, concentrated strength, and accelerating the construction of nucleic acid detection capabilities and sampling points.

Sun Jianping: ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a dialectical and unified concept that cannot be interpreted mechanically. The so-called ""dynamic"" is process, change, not blind and solidified; the so-called ""Zero-Covid"" is targeted, not absolute, one-size-fits-all.  ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost. To this end, the epidemic prevention and control should be effectively connected with the urban operation mechanism to avoid risk superposition. In the context of digital transformation, it is necessary to effectively combine urban public health management with urban security operations to achieve more data running, backstage integration, and less masses. While attaching great importance to the prevention and control of the epidemic, we must pay close attention to fire safety, production safety, meteorological disasters, etc., and do a good job of urban safety operation and maintenance.  Reporter: How to ""dynamic""?  Sun Jianping: First of all, scientific resistance must be based on virus variation. Virus variation is objective. With the development trend of the virus, timely adjust the anti -epidemic strategy, and continuously strengthen the scientific and rationality of the optimization strategy.  Secondly, reasonable immosts must respect the differences in society. Tens of thousands of communities, super -large cities with tens of millions of people, different people, their demand is different, and they need to be applied because of love.  Third, precision epidemic prevention must be classified. Precise investigation, accurate locking, scientific research and judgment, reasonable grading, and implementing classification of epidemic prevention methods can maximize the turmoil caused by the epidemic, and to maximize the stability of society. For example, the seal -controlled area does not go home, the control zone does not go out of the community, and the limited entry and exit of the defense zone is a classification classification policy, which is also the manifestation of ""dynamic"".  Reporter: How to achieve ""Zero-Covid""?  Sun Jianping: First, Zero-Covid must be precise. In the case of acceptable levels and severe levels of intensiveness, in the case of acceptable levels and steady reduction, ZERO-COVID is performed on specific communities, communities, and building units, and cases of specific groups, specific industries, and specific time periods.  Second, we must pay attention to the leakage of Zero-Covid of the high-risk population. Focusing on protecting the susceptible people, high -risk people such as children, elderly people, medical staff, and intensive service personnel have achieved ""zero leakage"" vaccination.  Third, we must pay attention to Zero-Covid. It is determined to be personnel involved in the central and high -risk communities (precise to buildings or units), and community reports and nucleic acid testing should be ""zero -leak"" and ""zero out of measurement"".  Fourth, we must pay attention to the case-by-case personnel to lose Zero-Covid. For persons who are positive or sub -densely connected in time, do a good job of tone, implement temporary isolation, short -term isolation, and nucleic acid detection, etc., deal with the source of infection, block the transmission chain, and gradually eliminate the epidemic in dynamics to prevent and control ""zero loopholes"" Essence  Fifth, we must maintain an overseas input overflow risk Zero-Covid. Research and judge overseas high -risk countries, high -risk personnel (international big data), and control and control it in grades to achieve ""zero out of control"".  ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a means and not a purpose  Reporter: What new issues and new challenges do ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" facing ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Sun Jianping: ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a means and not the purpose. For urban operations, it is basically to ensure urban operation order and safety, and protect the health and safety of the people under the front conditions of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". To the tackling stage, the challenge must be more complicated. When coexisting in a certain period of time, how to quickly concentrate resources and move resources to ensure the normal operation of the management lines, but also testing the urban managers, but also each organization and every organization. individual. One of the important issues is to coordinate the balance between various tasks and epidemic prevention work.  Reporter: What should I do?  Sun Jianping: Urban managers have a comprehensive analysis of various changes brought about by the prevention and control of the epidemic, and fully deduced the difficulties that may be encountered in order to formulate the optimal path. In the face of dynamic changes, management departments and various organizations at all levels are clear and the path is clear. When concentrating resources and moving resources, there are quantities and directions in your heart. It is necessary to coordinate the arrangement of institutional cadres, backbones of enterprises, and some volunteer groups and community service work. It should be noted that the more dynamic changes, the more you must realize the value of basic work.  For all units and organizations, the key to understanding the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to adapt to changes and constantly adjust working methods, organizational methods, and synergies with changes. It is necessary to realize that this is a dynamic, complex, and far -reaching challenge. Continuously innovate and achieve the normal operation of professional systems through various means. It is necessary to re -sort out the workflow, explore new work collaboration methods, coordinate community service work and professional work, establish a more flexible collaboration method to cope with the dynamic adjustment of epidemic prevention policies.  For everyone, recognize that infectious diseases are a common threat that humans have to face. In the long river of history, human beings have always faced such challenges. Infectious diseases have affected the development of human society more than once and changed the fate of many people. Fortunately, today we have the weapons and resources that deal with infectious diseases in our hands more than at any time in human history. In this case, establishing good habits, changing lifestyle, and taking courage and confidence to deal with changes in life is not only responsible for ourselves, but also responsible for others and society.",Epidemic prevention and control; urban operation mechanism; effective connection;,

From the perspective of sustainable development and management, how do you think of this policy?  Zhu Dajian: In the field of sustainable development of cities, there is a ""toughness"" concept in response to major risks, and its connotation has been extended two. The first is the ""sensual"" or immunity of the city. City, especially large cities, is a complex system with multiple elements and multi -centered and multi -centered. In the face of major risks and emergencies, whether the city has immunity and resistance. The major risks here include major public health risks such as infectious diseases. The second is the adaptability or recovery of the city. After major events or risks, whether there is an emergency mechanism to help cities reduce losses to return to normal as soon as possible.  From the perspective of sustainable development, the development of urban toughness depends on two lines. One line is a bearing capacity curve for threshold and bottom line, including the carrying capacity of urban infrastructure, ecology, economy, and society. Another line is the influence curve of how risks develop, depending on whether its peak is within the bearing capacity. If the risk is controlled within the bearing capacity, or it can be repaired immediately after exceeding, this development is tough and sustainable.  I understand that ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" is a tough epidemic prevention policy based on ""life first, people first"". ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" does well, and judge with people's supremacy and life first. Among them, how to balance security and development, how to take into account multiple parties, multiple interests, and how to deal with the relationship between seal control and liberalization is the key to whether there is a toughness of this anti -epidemic route with Chinese characteristics. In the past two years, this policy has achieved good results. In the face of the new challenges brought by the variants of Omikon, and the long-term combat that may be faced in the future, how to better understand and implement the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is very important.  Control the epidemic in a smaller cost in a shorter time  Reporter: How to understand the ""balance"" and ""considering"" of ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  The construction of the Da Da: The key to taking strict prevention and control measures for the fierce epidemic is how to control the epidemic in a shorter time in a shorter time to reduce the adverse effects of the epidemic. The costs here include the native disasters and secondary disasters caused by emergencies.  For ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it cannot be simply understood as ""Zero-Covid"". ""Dynamic"" is a very important expression and definition. First of all, ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to use fast, scientific and accurate prevention and control measures to ""discover and eliminate together."" Secondly, it is to grasp the balance point and do not take the extreme. ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not absolutely Zero-Covid, nor is it absolutely released. At present, there are some viewpoints that confront the sealing control with liberalization, resistance to the people's livelihood, resistance to the people, and the development of the economy.  On the other hand, in terms of vertical timeline, it also means judgment and execution with the times. If anti -epidemic is a ""war"" facing the virus, then according to the enemy's situation, seeking truth from facts, it is necessary to adjust and innovate under the fundamental goal of ""life first and people first"". Human society's response to the COVID-19 virus may enter a very long-term struggle stage. In the future, new situations such as virus variation will occur, and how to have multiple solution countermeasures under the security bottom line of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and adjust it in time, it is necessary to continuously explore and improve in practice.  Release new requirements for the construction of 15 minutes of life circle  Reporter: As a member of Shanghai citizens in the process of resistance and epidemic prevention, what do you think and perceive from your life?  Zhu Dajian: From the beginning of April 1st, I have made the numbers of the infected persons since March 1st since March 1st, and have been observing how the research index has gone out of the U -shaped U -shaped. The COVID-19 epidemic was an unprecedented challenge and test to Shanghai's urban development and governance capabilities. I understand the pressure of front -line workers and the hardships paid. I have also had anxiety in daily food and medicine support.  Study the sustainable development of cities. In contrast to the current epidemic, I think there are many things that Shanghai's urban development needs to patch in terms of strengthening governance capabilities and marketization. For example, for the ""15 -minute life circle"" planned in Shanghai: First, there must be a community 15 -minute nucleic acid detection point, which can minimize infections caused by agglomeration as much as possible. Second, we must build and sell vegetables and daily foods. The community supermarket in 15 minutes plays a certain role in ensuring the supply of communities. Third, the community doctors' contract system is usually established to be able to start to solve problems such as medical treatment within the community.  Copy the test of governance in crisis. The general policy of implementing the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" should not be regarded as a matter of simple public health and medical sector, but it should be regarded as a matter of collaborative operations for key links in the key parts of the city. Carry out the overall planning and coordination of cross -departments, and resolve possible secondary problems from the source to further enhance the immunity and recovery of urban response to sudden public disasters.",General policy; cities sustainable development;,

What does ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" mean in a cities with a high degree of aging? Since the epidemic, the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University has become a designated medical institution. In an interview with reporters, Qin Lunxiu, executive deputy dean of Baoshan Hospital, said that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with my country's national conditions and Shanghai The characteristics of the city and the policy itself are the basic protection of the elderly.  Qinlunxiu said that in this round of epidemic, Omik Rongzhu's ability to spread is very strong, which is not the same as the initial strain in the Wuhan period two years ago. The proportion of mutant strains to severe illnesses and critical illnesses does not mean ""lying down"".  Experts explain to this: Shanghai is a large city with a population of 25 million. In 2021, the expected life expectancy of per capita is 84.11 years. In 2020, the city's household registration population 60 or more people account for 36.1%, which is evident. Most of the elderly are accompanied by one or more chronic diseases. After infection with the mutant strains of Omircor, the symptoms caused by the virus itself may not be serious, but the symptoms of a variety of chronic diseases will occur at the same time, which requires strong medical support.  Taking the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital as an example, there are currently more than 700 beds, one -third of which are elderly people over 70 years old, and there are 20 or 30 elderly people between 90 and 100. Almost all of them have a variety of basic diseases, some are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and some are dialysis of uremia. If these elderly people are infected with Omikon, they cannot be sent to designated hospitals in time. Essence  It is reported that so far, the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital has been a designated hospital as a positive infected person and has conducted a number of emergency surgery, including gastric perforation, appendicitis, brain surgery, trachea foreign body, esophageal foreign body, etc. Not long ago, a 90 -year -old man accidentally swallowed the dental dental, and the medical staff operated under the emergency gastroscopy, and the old man finally turned to safety.  Qinlun said that at present, as the setting of designated hospitals has gradually increased, the treatment of the elderly in the basic disease will be better guaranteed.  From the perspective of experts, COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease. It adheres to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" cutting source and is relatively isolated by the infected population. It is very necessary for the high population density in Shanghai. This is also an effective measure to control the further development of the epidemic.  Qin Lunxiu said that as an ordinary citizen, when facing the epidemic, he attaches great importance to not to panic. During the epidemic epidemic, citizens should reduce flow, wash their hands, wear masks, maintain a certain social distance, pay attention to disinfection and cleaning, etc. These are the practices of protecting themselves and their families, and they also contribute to society.",Huashan Hospital; designated hospital; elderly people; basic protection;,

Shanghai resolutely implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions, and insisted that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy was not shaken in accordance with the requirements put forward during the investigation and guidance of Shanghai Chunlan. On April 15, since the city launched Zero-Covid, the action effect has become increasingly apparent. The current epidemic is still very severe. The prevention and control work is at a critical moment of climbing. In order to further consolidate and expand the effectiveness of Zero-Covid, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have made new deployment of the social Zero-Covid.  According to the overall idea of ""unified command, classification policy, and concentrated attack"", focus on using ""global static management, full -staff testing and screening, comprehensive flow investigation, cleaning and killing of the whole people, leakage and supplementing"" measures, and take it. By the time ""should be inspected, should be separated, the acceptance, and the treatment should be treated.""  According to the deployment of the Nine National Congress, community management and control operations will be carried out to maximize the gathering of personnel flow. The seal -and -control area strictly implements the requirements of ""not leaving home and service"", clarify that special personnel are responsible for the supply of residents' living materials, and earnestly do a good job of helping purchase and distribution of households. For people who need to go out for medical treatment, they must be able to do personal protection throughout the process and implement closed -loop management throughout the community. The management and control area strictly implements the requirements of ""people who do not get out of the community (unit), and the peaks are taken for things."" In principle, each household can be in an orderly manner and the partition restrictions to the designated area designated areas under the premise of strict personal protection every day. There is no contact type and distribution of supplies. For people who need to go out for medical treatment, they must be able to do personal protection throughout the process and implement closed -loop management throughout the community. If infected, the residential community and venue rose to the seal control area. The ""personal protection and gathering of gathering"" requirements for the prevention area are strictly implemented. Personnel shall not flow to the seal -controlled area and the control area. If a positive infection occurs, the residential community and venue will rise to the seal control area. Strengthen street inspection and strengthen the management of mobile personnel such as express delivery services, volunteers and living insurance supply. Moral personnel enter and leave the residential communities to present 24 -hour nucleic acid test negative proof and health code. Take home magnetic and other methods to restrict personnel to restrict personnel, and give the health code red code.  Carry out testing and screening operations. Adopting a partial grade detection promotion mode, a round of nucleic acid screening is carried out every day in the seal control area. The antigen detection positive reviewer, the mixed pipe -positive reviewer and their homes/same householders use single -tube single mining to sample on the door. If there are infected people in the community within 5 days, all the personnel where the infected person is located (unit) all the people came to the door; other buildings (units) personnel goes downstairs. For the control area, the ""3 -day antigen+2 -day nucleic acid"" combination screening method is used. The antigen detection positive reviewer, the mixed pipe -positive to be reviewed, and the same home/homestead, and the door to sample. For the prevention area, the combination of ""4 -day antigen+1 day nucleic acid"" is used, such as antigen detection positive, confrontation against the original positive person and its homes/same homes, single -pipe single -tube single -minrite detection, and on -door sampling. For urban service guarantee personnel such as express delivery, takeaway brothers, detect nucleic acids and 2 antigens once a day.  Carry out flow investigation operations. Focus on the current infected persons, and reasonably determine the secret and secondary connection. Focus on investigating common living, shared elevators, same floors, up and down floors and other people. Carry out special flow and in -depth investigations on collective places such as factory enterprises, construction sites, and pension institutions that have gathered epidemics. The newly discovered first -screen positive personnel can investigate the day and the sun.  Carry out transfer isolation operations. All risks such as the infected and closely connected are transferred to isolation in a timely manner, controlling the source of infection, cutting off the spread of the chain, and resolutely achieve the Japanese and clear knots. At the same time, those who meet the discharge, out of the cabin, and dismiss the isolation standards will be transferred in time to speed up the circulation of medical beds and isolation rooms. The square cabin hospital and designated hospitals conduct daily nucleic acid tests on patients in the hospital, which meets the list of people in the discharge standards to timely push the community transfer group in time. After receiving the list of discharge personnel, the community transfer group will timely send the vehicles to pick up the discharge personnel.  Carry out the extension of the extension. Fully excavate potential, increase the increasing beds and expand beds, and make overall scheduling resources to speed up the circulation of medical beds and isolation rooms. The square-cap hospital is transformed into a fixed-point hospital in the region to treat patients with COVID-19 virus-positive combined basic diseases. For the residences with home isolation conditions, the transitional and local isolation is implemented on the basis of strict management. In the community as the unit, we can find out the number of patients with regular treatment of patients with hemodialysis, maternal maternal, tumor chemotherapy and other regular treatment, and targeted docking medical institutions. The community health service center is all open to solve the needs of common diseases and multiple diseases. The community arranges vehicles responsible for patients to go out for medical transportation. Medical institutions and ambulances must not refuse and delay the diagnosis and treatment of patients on the grounds of nucleic acid testing.  Carry out Chinese medicine intervention operations. Give full play to the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, reduce the incidence, and increase the treatment rate. Personnel intervention in the same control area such as primary sieve positive personnel, concentration or home isolation, sub -dense personnel, and nucleic acid testing positive patients in the same unit in the same unit in the same unit of the same unit.  Carry out cleaning and disinfection. In accordance with the degree of risk of epidemic dissemination, clean disinfection is carried out in batches in batches to ensure that it should be eliminated to completely eliminate the possible virus pollution environment. Implement the work requirements of positive personnel, that is, the transfer of the building, and the building, and the building. After the building finds the infected person, it must conduct a special disinfecting operation in time. After the infected person is transferred, the professional team will complete the end disinfection after the professional team. It is eliminated for public places where communities, office buildings, construction sites, public places, and pension institutions are gathered.  Carry out the ""pull point"" operation. For areas with a large number of infections, long duration, and high risk of transmission, concentrated power is concentrated. The old communities, urban villages, and crowds of living places that have been combed with a clustered epidemic and continued to spread are fully sorted out. Strictly adopt closed management measures, and take on -site magnetic measures such as the gate buildings and village houses with infected people to implement closed management of factories, construction sites, nursing homes, and psychiatric hospitals.  Carry out anti -overflowing actions. Adhere to the spread of internal defense and output of external prevention, further strengthen the management of personnel from Shanghai, and minimize the risk of outflow of epidemic. It is not necessary to leave Shanghai, and the personnel in the controlled area and the management and control areas are not necessary to leave the area. Those who really need to travel must hold a 48 -hour kernel detection negative certificate, the antigen detection negative proof and the health code ""green code"" travel within 24 hours.

To realize the social ZERO-COVID as soon as possible, you can win the hard fight against this difficult epidemic as soon as possible, and let the city in Shanghai restore normal operation as soon as possible. This is undoubtedly the urgent desire of the current 25 million Shanghai people.  Since this round of epidemic, Shanghai has resolutely implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions. According to the requirements put forward by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chunlan's investigation and guidance in Shanghai, he adheres to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" general policy. On April 15, Shanghai began to go all out. For a week, the positive effects of all aspects are becoming increasingly emerging. This brings confidence to our further tackling sprints. At the same time, we must also be soberly realized that the current epidemic situation is still complicated and severe, and the prevention and control work is at a critical moment when it is climbing.  According to the latest deployment of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the ""Nine Congress Actions"" will be implemented throughout the city today. In order to maximize, thoroughly screen the risk, cut off the spread of the chain, and make up for the short board vulnerabilities.  Undoubtedly, ""strict"", ""from the real"" and ""obsession"", these consistent principles of prevention and control need to be implemented in the ""Nine Congress Actions"" and implemented more pragmatically. Strive to achieve 100 % expected results. At a critical moment, there must be no more layer of attenuation and leveling loss, and the chain cannot be dropped. At the same time, in the process of implementing the ""Nine Congress Actions"", it is necessary to effectively respond to the reasonable concern of the citizens and effectively improve the working methods. If the organization and implementation of large -scale nucleic acid detection should be avoided through reasonable planning layout and scientific organization arrangements to avoid cross -infection risks to the greatest extent. The management of the seal control area must not be discounted, but also reflects the temperature, especially the special needs of the elderly, children, pregnant women and other special groups, and the need for medical treatment and medicine to delay the needy. The transfer isolation of infected people should improve efficiency, and it should also be aimed at the humanized operation of special groups, reflecting the temperature that the city should have.  We must have a scientific understanding of the necessity and urgency of related action measures. For example, a high -frequency continuous detection and screening is to dynamically discover positive infections as soon as possible to block community transmission; to take decisive measures to transfer the infection and achieve ""four should be four"", and it is also to cut off the source of infection as soon as possible. In terms of prevention and control of infectious diseases, these are effective methods. For the differentiated management requirements of the sealing and control areas, control areas, and prevention areas, and some temporary rearrassing control in the area adjacent to the control areas and high population density are all to minimize the risk of gathering agglomerations to go smoothly in order to go smoothly Specifically spent this sprint to attack, ushered in a decisive victory.  These measures can not help but have a continuous impact on citizens' lives. However, for each ordinary citizen, cooperate with the corresponding work and fulfill their own control responsibilities, which is the best support for preventing and controlling the overall situation, that is, the strives and efforts of the early recovery of normal life. This is ""a hard time to overcome the time"" and ""work together.""  Since this round of epidemic, everyone has worked hard, and it is not easy for everyone. At this moment, Shuguang has begun to appear, and I believe no one is willing to lose money.

At the Di'an Medical Testing Institute, Gong Zheng video inspected the operation of the nucleic acid detection laboratory, and listened to the introduction of the work and the layout of the nucleic acid sampling point of the test and screening. Gong Zheng emphasized that we must do everything possible to improve the efficiency of nucleic acid detection, and ""collect, send, check, report, transfer, transfer, collect"" efficient connection and integration, strengthen the quality control of nucleic acid detection, increase the intensity of flow, and accelerate the speed of transfer. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of nucleic acid sampling points, expand the sampling personnel team, strengthen personnel training, and meet the normalization, facilitation, and accessible sampling needs of citizens.  Tongji New Village, located on Siping Road Street, Yangpu District, has dynamically adjusted management and control measures according to the results and actual conditions of the stage screening. The city leaders climbed to the large community to learn more about the division of differentiated prevention and control management. Gong Zheng said that it is necessary to strengthen community management, keep the door, control the small door, firmly adhere to the results of epidemic prevention, and avoid rebounding. It is necessary to accelerate the transfer of risk personnel and prevent virus spread. It is necessary to implement the ""inspection of inspection"", and at the same time strictly standardize the nucleic acid detection process, and avoid the risk of cross -infection.

""In the face of protecting the safety of the people, we must at all costs, and we can also do all the costs.""  Anti -fighting epidemic is for the people, and they must rely on the people.

The essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" lies in fast and precise  Reporter: What practical considerations are behind some countries' ""coexisting with the virus""?  Chen Xueming: Advocating ""coexisting with the virus"", a direct consequence is ""the snow in front of the door"".  A non-profit news website in the United States has announced that since the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the situation of wealthy and poor internationally internationally has a great difference. In New York, COVID-19 has the highest per capita income from five regions with the highest positive rate. The per capita annual income is from US $ 17,000 to $ 35,000; and the five regions with the lowest positive rates have per capita income from 100,000 US dollars to 150,000 US dollars. Judging from the current situation, this unfairness in American society may be more serious.  Reporter: What advantages do we adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid""?  Chen Xueming: The practice of foreign anti -epidemic has repeatedly proven that the ""small government"" designed by the new liberal market economy cannot integrate the anti -epidemic force of all parties; advocating ""coexisting with the virus"" and further breaking the myth of the Western ""institutional advantages"".  The socialist system with Chinese characteristics is worthy of the huge advantage of ""China's resistance"". ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best choice based on China's current epidemic situation at this stage. It is the minimum anti-epidemic strategy of comprehensive social costs. It can avoid the huge life and economic costs of the out of control of the epidemic. We insist on implementing the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", the essence is fast and accurate. This should be done, and this can be done. This is based on the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.

Chen Xueming: This anti-COVID-19 epidemic is a big test for the national governance system and governance capabilities. I understand that this big test is mainly reflected in the correct disposal of anti -epidemic and production, seal control and life. To persist in using Marxist positions to guide epidemic prevention and resistance, we must insist on dealing with the relationship between resistance and production, seal control and life with dialectical methods.  On the Internet, you can see such a question from time to time: choose life or economy? In fact, this question itself must be reflected. This is a way of thinking that is not the same. Under the guidance of Marxist dialectics, in addition to insisting on two points, we must also grasp the focus theory, and we must focus on the main aspects of contradictions during a specific period and stage.  People's livelihood is the biggest political. When focusing on resistance, we must take care of the economy and people's livelihood, and to grasp the ""epidemic"" with one hand and develop it with one hand.

The SAIC Group Commando arrived at Pujiang Town at 4 am on the 9th, and took a break to invest in volunteer services on the same day. Every night when I go to bed, the players have adjusted the ringtone of the mobile phone to the most, for fear of missing any instructions.  ""On April 11th, a new day was opened by a ringtone of a mobile phone. At 5:40 in the morning, the reception commissioner was required to support the recovery of the chasing yang as soon as possible."" The famous players wrote in the diary of the day.  No matter what the original occupation is, ""carrying a big bag"" in the post of volunteers is always inevitable. At 8 o'clock on April 19, the Shanghai Urban Investment Group Commando ushered in 13 vehicles, a total of more than 30,000 copies, weighing hundreds of tons. Vegetables are not easy to save and must be unloaded in time. The task fell on dozens of volunteers at them and Shanghai Police School. From 8 o'clock, after lunch, sweat was soaked in his placket, and there was still a car that did not finish it. Captain Wang Xiaochang said: ""This is the norm. When you come to Bei Cai these days, there are 20,000 or even 30,000 or even 30,000 or even 30,000 or even 30,000 or even 30,000 or even 300,000 residents.  Brain  Volunteers are physical work, but not only physical work. Under the epidemic, human and material resources are extremely tight. How to coordinate and coordinate requires a lot of brains.  The Guotai Junan Commando encountered a general problem: the source of material sources continued to be transported to the community, but the staff and the vehicle were insufficient, and it was difficult to distribute them into the hands of the residents in time.  what to do? Is there any possibility of improvement? After observing the existing distribution plan, the team members found that the problem found that the manpower was distributed on average in various links -the pipes and unloading and distribution of the pipes and unloading and distributed tube distribution. Many time consumption was consumed in the waiting. long.  As a result, they used the concepts of customer demand management and standardized processes in financial services to simulate work scenarios and used data algorithms to establish four models. One model is a human -car schedule.  The reporter saw that in the ""Guarantee Model"" document, each model has a data table, computing formula, and flowchart. After comparing the four models of the assault team, the conclusion: the model II efficiency is improved by about 70%; the efficiency of the model III increases by about 410%, which is suitable for centralized tackling; the efficiency of the model IV is about 190%, and the team has a full rotation.  The Shanghai Urban Investment Group Commando also encountered similar problems when delivering medicines for residents. Faced with a large number of backlogs and nearly 100 delivery addresses, even if they did their homework in advance to be familiar with the surrounding environment, the players still spent a lot of time on the design distribution route. In response to this problem, the assault player Xu Yang proposed a solution: import the delivery address into a smart map software in batches to allow the software planning to plan the optimal distribution route. The next day, the assault players were delivered to the planned route and found that it was feasible. After repeated testing, it was found that sending medicines in a new method is about 30%compared to previous use.  Use  ""Sometimes it is more useful than that."" Yao Jie of the Municipal State -owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission has worked in the three streets in Huangpu District, and has a deep understanding of the people in the work of the masses.  As the deputy captain of the commando, he repeatedly took care of the players from the organs and the Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank, and he must be calm when he encounters contradictions. ""We have to appease instead of arguing."" He said, ""In fact, to some extent, letting the masses vent on negative energy is also a job for our volunteers. A way of work in the masses. ""  Use love, to the masses, and to their teammates. On April 10th, the 27th birthday of SAIC's assault player Tang Qianlong. Captain Liu Zhengjun customized a birthday cake for him and sent a bowl of hot life star noodles. At the birthday party, Tang Qianlong connected his wife, who was also on the front line of epidemic, and his mother and two -year -old children. The moment everyone sang a birthday song for him, he said: ""This is the most meaningful and most memorable birthday in his life."" On the same day, he and three other assault teams solemnly submitted an application for joining the party to the party organization.  Some of the more than 150 players of the four assault teams come from the prevention area of non -positive cases, but they said: ""What is the use of a leaf Guka in the sea of Wangyang, it will still sink one day in the morning and evening. It's also to protect our own family. """,Assault team; assault player; Shanghai state -owned assets;,

This is a new pilot of the Ronghua residential area since this round of epidemic: the 211 members who have reported to the community are compiled into 12 community temporary party branches in accordance with the principle of gridization. The community establishes a ""group of love and war"", with the group leader, the backbone of the community group, and the employee of the party.

On the evening of April 16th, a newsletter came from the WeChat groups of various buildings in Huizhi Apartment. It was reported that from the same day, the apartment was adjusted from the seal control area to the control area. Home health monitoring. Seeing this news, the tenant Gu Xiaoyan could not hide his inner excitement.  The Huizhi Apartment rented by Gu Xiaoyan is located between Zhangjiang and Jinqiao, Pudong. It is a typical full rental community. There are 698 renters and 1,450 tenants. Essence Since the sealing of the community on March 28, the three parties of the property, the owner, and the tenants have actively acted and spent the difficulties again and again.  Since this wave of epidemic, the background of the Shanghai rumor platform has received a message from many netizens for help, saying that the types of houses they live in are commercial and residential apartments, and lack of grass -roots organizations. The in -laws of prevention in the community need to be strengthened. You know, in Shencheng, there are a lot of rented communities, especially before the tremendous pressure of epidemic prevention and control, it is generally facing realistic dilemma of the management of neighborhood committees and industry committees. How should such a community manage? Perhaps the practice of Huizhi Apartment can be used as a reference.  Where do you start your home?  Most of the young people who live in Shanghai in Huizhi Apartment have returned and returned early on weekdays. In addition, the apartment has a high liquidity and a weak sense of belonging. Unlike ordinary houses, the apartment lacks grass -roots organizations such as neighborhood committees, and only the property provides basic services. Therefore, in the early days of the epidemic, ""how to carry out the epidemic prevention and control work"" has become the biggest problem in front of tenants.  On April 2, the first positive case appeared in the apartment. Faced with the threat of the COVID-19 virus, while the property company emerged to eliminate disinfecting and connecting and transferring, the tenants also saw the actual situation of the property company's lack of hands, and opened up the ""self-rescue"" operation.  ""Previously, due to the flow of the tenants, the group group was fixed. After the community was closed, we first established the building group to help each other."" In Gu Xiaoyan, the building group group quickly established a steady establishment of steady establishment. Living in the heart of tenants, it also provided a good communication platform for ""self -rescue"". Immediately afterwards, in the group groups, some tenants told themselves to be the leader of the building to provide various services for tenants in the building. The material exchange between tenants was quietly developed.  The existing supplies are obviously not enough. How to purchase, how to eliminate new supplies, how to eliminate killing more thoroughly, and how nucleic acid detection is more orderly ... More and more tenants have begun to actively register with the property, requiring volunteers to participate in the community in the community. Services, the ""self -rescue"" operation spreads to the entire community.  The number of volunteers has gradually increased to more than 80 people, becoming an important force for the epidemic prevention and control in the apartment. Tenner Li Zhengyue participated in the airport volunteer service in May 2020. He saw many enthusiastic volunteers lacking relevant experience in infection control, and he started a ""little teacher"" to explain and demonstrate the process of penetrating and taking off the protective clothing. ""Volunteers are all high -risk people, and protective measures must be in place."" Information verification, security diversion, maintenance of order, and moving materials ... Gu Yi put on the protective clothing and runs to sweep the building. ""At that time, I didn't think too much, and I didn't have much words, just to simply want to make some efforts for the place where life."" Tenrs also used the resources on their hands to transform into the head of the group and actively contact the supplier to ensure the material guarantee of the community. Power. There are more volunteers who are transformed into caring people to contribute, statistics, handling of materials, and sending food from house to house.  The tenants of Huizhi Apartment understand that although they just rented them briefly, this special period is their home. ""Guarding our home, we are incomparable.""  How to condense all parties?  Property manager Xiao Song was very happy to see that with the active participation of volunteers, the situation of the personnel of the property company was greatly relieved. Come. Except for security and cleaning, there are only two managers in the property office, which failed to establish a comprehensive volunteer working mechanism. Personally do the same job. How to coordinate management and use the power of volunteers on the blade?  In the group, some volunteers made suggestions, ""Can it be a temporary party branch?"" It turned out that there were more than 100 Communist Party members in the community, most of which had responded to the call of the municipal party committee and municipal government, and participated in the volunteer service of the front line of the community. middle. They urgently hope that they can establish temporary party organizations in the community, so as to coordinate multi -party resources and consolidate community forces.  After multiple communication with the superior party organization, on April 10, Huizhi Apartment established a temporary party branch with a total of 5 members of the branch committee. Secretary, a propaganda committee member, living committee member, and organization member. Based on the original volunteer team, five groups of nucleic acid groups, material groups, security groups, emergency groups, and propaganda groups are set up according to the work content. Docking, give full play to the cohesion of the party organization, and build a ""red fortress"" for the prevention and control of the apartment epidemic. ""Work is more targeted and more efficient and orderly."" Li Zhengyue said.  The members of the nucleic acid group are mainly responsible for tenants' information inspection and organizational nucleic acid testing. In recent times, almost every nucleic acid detection can see the staff of the nucleic acid group staff. They transformed into ""big white"" and accurately divide the batch, time, and order of the detection detection. Order. The material group mainly guarantees the material reserves of the tenant's home isolation, including both the ""official group purchase channels"" provided by the Pukai Group with its own resource channels and contacting vegetables to ensure the company, as well as the group purchase carried out by the community owners.  Fan Hongwei further explained that ""On the one hand, the material group contacted the supplier, and on the other hand, it was also necessary to review the group purchase of the owner spontaneously, ensuring that‘ non -necessary group purchase ’and reducing the risk of foreign material infection.”  As for the security group and the emergency group, the response to emergencies in the community, the dispersion work, and the medical treatment, the publicity team is responsible for the production and release of the daily ""Hui Zhi Newsletter"". The epidemic situation, group purchase information, reminder notifications, etc. will be notified in a timely manner. On the one hand, the tenants are assured and at ease, and on the other hand, they repeatedly remind everyone to prevent the epidemic prevention and control.  On the morning of April 17, Fan Hongwei once again convened members of the branch and members of various working groups to discuss the specific operation gestures such as ""distribution and medical treatment"".

After seeing some information circulating on the Internet, many people have questioned the general policy of the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" epidemic in my country. Essence What does epidemiological experts think about this issue? The reporter interviewed Xu Gang, an associate professor of the School of Public Health at the School of Medicine of Shanghai Jiaotong University.  ""At this stage, my country should still adhere to the 'dynamic Zero-Covid' policy. In terms of scientific speaking, from the perspective of economic and social development, this policy is the best choice at this stage."" Xu Gang said, ""Of course, of course, too. It is necessary to see that the recent epidemic prevention and control has made many Shanghai citizens encounter difficulties in life and medical treatment. This requires the government and all walks of life in the society to find ways and optimize measures to relieve the citizens as soon as possible. ""  Scientifically speaking, although many people have milder after being infected with Omikon, research data at home and abroad show that this mutant plant has great lethality to the elderly, especially the elderly without vaccination. The mortality and severe rate of disease are high, and it is by no means a ""large influenza"". Taking the Hong Kong epidemic as an example, since the beginning of this year, there are more than 8,000 cases of death in Hong Kong due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The latest research shows that the risk of death of people over 60 is 252 times that of the risk of death of people under 30, the age of the deceased is 86 years old, and 96%of death cases are over 60 years old.  Xu Gang analyzed that Shanghai is the most aging city in my country. If Omikon is spread on a large scale in this city and does not take ""thunderbolt"" to curb it, it may cause a large number of elderly severe cases and even death cases. Once this happens, it will be the pain of our unbearable family and society.  And after the epidemic, if ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not timely, once a scale rebounds, the medical system will face the danger of being penetrated. At that time, it may cause major social problems that impact the psychological stability of the group.  Research in Hong Kong also shows that in this round of epidemic, the disease mortality rate of non -vaccination reached 2.87%, and the mortality rate for the elderly over 80 years old who did not vaccine were as high as 15.68%; Reduce at least 10 times. This shows that the continuous improvement of the vaccine vaccination rate of the elderly is an important part of the prevention and control of the epidemic, which can be done together with the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  Xu Gang said that although my country ’s 60 -year -old and above groups of vaccination have reached about 84.35%, at least 40 million elderly people have not completed the whole process, and the vaccination rate of elderly people in some regions is relatively low. At present, most of these areas are in the stage of normalized epidemic prevention and control, and measures such as inoculation can be adopted in a timely manner to effectively promote the basic immune vaccination and strengthening immune vaccination of the elderly throughout the process, so as to ""take over"". Shanghai should continue to promote this work after surviving this very period, especially to increase the vaccination rate of the elderly to strengthen the needle vaccine.  From the perspective of economic and social development, Shanghai, as an international metropolis, is a hub for the flow and transportation of domestic personnel. If Shanghai cannot achieve ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" in this epidemic, it is likely that the virus will spread through people and things to the Yangtze River Delta and even the country, which will have a large and negative impact on my country's economic and social development. In the short term, Shanghai's economic and social and citizens' lives will be affected by closed management, but from the perspective of a country's overall perspective, people in local areas are controlled and controlled to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Essence Therefore, Shanghai must adhere to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"", which is a good strategy to ensure the stability of the Yangtze River Delta and the national economic banking.",vaccine vaccination; epidemic prevention and control; best choice;,

The medical system has caused greater panic and influence on the entire society. ""Li Jue, a professor of epidemiology at Tongji University School of Medicine, said in an interview with reporters.  The R0 value of the early mutation strain in the COVID-19 virus was almost 3, which was almost the same as the flu. The so -called R0 value, that is, the abbreviation of the basic infection, is that the average number of infected people in the infection during the infection period can cause the susceptible individual to the disease during the infection without taking any intervention measures. The larger the R0 value, the stronger the contagiousness. For example, the R0 value is 3, which means that the average infected person will be infected by 3 people, but the COVID-19 virus is constantly mutating. The R0 value is almost 10, far exceeding the infectious fluidity of the flu.  According to reports, in accordance with the law of epidemiological diseases, there is a process of ""starting period -rapid growth period -platform period -decline period"" process. When basically enters the platform period, there will be fluctuations. In the process, there is a hidden period of the virus, the virus load is different, and the process of breeding in the body varies from person to person. This is a stage. ""What we want to pursue is to promote the renewal rate of this infection as soon as possible. Therefore, at this stage, we must adhere to the‘ dynamic Zero-Covid ’not shaken.""  Due to various reasons, the vaccination rate of some elderly people and people with basic diseases in our country was not high. Compared with developed countries, there are still gaps in the ICU (intensive nursing ward) and intensive treatment methods across the country. Wang Huaqing, chief expert of the China Centers for Immunization Planning, said recently that the three risk factors that lead to COVID-19 severe and death include senior, chronic basic diseases, and unpoting vaccines. Li Jue said: ""If you don't insist on the"" dynamic Zero-Covid ', Omikon has a fast transmission speed and a large area of overeating, we will be very passive, especially after the fragile groups such as the elderly and the basic diseases are infected. The risk is great. ""The data shows that about 94%of the cumulative death cases of Hong Kong's fifth wave of epidemic situation are elderly people over 60 years old. After further investigation, they found that the vaccination rate among the deaths of the elderly. There is a big gap.  Li Jue believes that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not pursuing complete zero infection, but to discover and control in time in the society. The key is fast, accurate, and solid, especially to speed up the prevention and control. When there are many positive infections and it is difficult to trace the epidemiology, it is necessary to further strengthen the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".

Why must ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" not relax? How to achieve the epidemic caused by the epidemic caused by the Omikon mutant strain? The reporter interviewed Fang Binghua, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.  Fang Binghua said that there are three main methods for prevention and control of infectious diseases: controlling the source of infection, cutting off the channels of communication, and protecting the susceptible people. This means that the prevention and control of infectious diseases require the participation of the whole society. In 2022, the COVID-19 epidemic caused by the mutant strain of Omikon is very widely susceptible. From the clinic, we see that the elderly from the newborn to the years are all sensible people. The ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" for the COVID-19 epidemic is also based on extensive consideration of susceptible people.  As the characteristics of the new type of virus, the Omikon mutant strain also determines that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" measures are needed to prevent and control. Fang Binghua said that the mutant plant has a considerable proportion of immune escape. After the injection of the vaccine, it can reduce the severe proportion of infected people, but it cannot ensure that 100 % is not infected. Adhering to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" is to make the susceptible population less infected or not infected. This is the government's duties and adhere to the concept of ""people first and life first"".  Through the basic formula of infectious disease prevention and control, realizing the social Zero-Covid as soon as possible should be the consensus of all professionals, which is beyond doubt. ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the social expression of professional terms of infectious disease prevention consensus.  Fang Binghua introduced that Shanghai has a successful experience in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in history. When he was popular in liver A in 1988, jaundice was found. Outpatient screening of liver disease was found. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, it was ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" from today's perspective. Omikon's mutation was aggressive this time, and ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" seemed to pay much attention. In fact, for more than two years of resistance, Shanghai has been in different stages of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" for different measures and gestures of different stages, including external prevention input and internal defense rebound.  Shanghai has more than two years of anti-epidemic experience. Our understanding of the COVID-19 virus has also been updated and profound. Such cognition has a great inspiration for other new infectious disease prevention and treatment in the future. Fang Binghua believes that in this epidemic, all citizens are witnesses and participants. They adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" not only cover doctors and nurses to do their best. Once flowing, infection entering the treatment point for treatment, recovery, and recovery as soon as possible, this is also from different perspectives to the dynamic Zero-Covid process from different perspectives, which also adds a force to the anti-epidemic.  ""In the end, I want to say that Shanghai rarely experiences such a process. Since the epidemic, cities have continuously accumulated experience in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. In the future, I believe that Shanghai will be more wise and calm when dealing with infectious disease prevention.""

Why does China adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" at this stage?  For more than two years of resistance, he has given a footnote from multiple aspects. The most basic set of data is that COVID-19 has two years of popularity. China, which has the most population in the world, is the country with the least COVID-19 patients. The incidence and mortality are the lowest in the world. Last year's data, China COVID-19's prevalence was 1/1678 in the United States, and the mortality rate was 1/606 in the United States. At the same time, the average number of ICU beds per 100,000 people in China is 3.6, which is about 1/10 of the United States.  In other words, China's anti -epidemic results, including the stable, orderly, and normal operation of most local economic and society for more than two years, and were obtained in the case of relatively weak medical resources and public health systems. Moreover, there is still a huge difference in the foundation of medical treatment and public health between east and west and between urban and rural areas. If it is not the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" strategy, such results are obviously unimaginable.  The World Health Organization experts recently actively evaluated the prevention and control measures of China in response to the COVID-19 epidemic, and believed that these measures ensured the extremely low incidence, mortality and hospitalization rates, as well as the smooth operation of social and economy. Maria Vankskhofhov, the leader of the WHO Health Emergency Project, said that many countries are now trying to get rid of the current situation of the epidemic, but the COVID-19 has entered the third year, and the virus still has great energy. The new cases reported by Zhou to the WHO are still tens of millions of levels, and this data is underestimated because some countries have significantly reduced or even stop testing.  ""The world is exhausted by the COVID-19 epidemic, but unfortunately we have not gotten off the epidemic."" The reality is so helpless. And at least at present, we can't pack tickets 100 %, saying that Omikon BA.2 strains will definitely be or must be regarded as the end of the epidemic.  Biologist Rao Yi recently wrote that virus mutations have no correlation with the symptoms of infected people. ""The longer the epidemic will, the stronger or weaker the infectiousness. Or weaker "" -At least for a virus that is in great popularity and may be further mutated, it cannot be asserted that the future must become more and more milder, or it may become bad. ""The virus is not performed by others, but it has changed its own. People are just a carrier.""  Understanding along this point of view means that ""uncertainty"" still exists, and China's population scale, immune background, differences in medical and health systems, old and young population bases, etc., have determined that once the intervention is abandoned, it may be affected by the abandonment, which may be subject to intervention, which may be subject to intervention, maybe it may be subject to intervention, which may be subject to intervention. The expected risks and extrusion beyond the expected and expected, and there was no back arrow. Relevant experts have repeatedly stated that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best choice based on the current situation of my country's current epidemic situation at this stage. The reason is from this. Based on the reality of the country today, this is a more cautious and secure strategy.  ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" should also be regarded as a positive prevention and control strategy. The essence, one is fast, the other is precise, and its purpose is to ensure that all possible and maximize the health and life of the people of the general public. Safety. Our goal is to fully protect every life. This is the true meaning of ""people's supremacy and life first"". Among them, to ensure the physical health and people's livelihood needs of all people, especially to take care of the needs of various difficult groups and risk groups, it is natural. On the current battlefield of resistance, this is undoubtedly a severe and comprehensive test, which requires a highly professional, fine, scientific, and efficient work.  During the recent inspection in Hainan, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, adhere to foreign prevention input, internal prevention rebound, adhere to scientific precision, dynamic Zero-Covid, and focus on the prevention and control of the epidemic. It is necessary to overcome the paralysis thoughts, the mood of wars, the fluke, and the mentality of looseness, and improve the new characteristics of virus mutation, improve the ability to prevent and control scientific precision prevention and control, improve various emergency plans, strictly implement normalization prevention and control measures, and maximize the development of epidemic situations for economic and social development. Impact.  In these words, there are many test questions that need to be continuously persisted and worked hard. Adhering to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" general policy of not hesitation is a big test for ""science and precision"", and it is also a big test that fully interprets the concept of ""people first and life first"". , Also test the mission and responsibility. This is the ""China Road"" that fights the epidemic.

Promoting the inspection, the acceptance of the acceptance, the depletion of the acceptance, the depends on, and the treatment should be treated, laying a solid foundation for the realization of the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Why is ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" a way to persist? The reporter interviewed Wu Huanyu, deputy director of the Shanghai Disease Prevention and Control Center.  Wu Huanyu said that first, the strains of the epidemic of Shanghai this round of epidemic are mainly Omikon BA.2. The measures should be dealt with. Omikon has a very fast transmission speed, and the secrets are particularly strong. The proportion of asymptomatic infected and mild cases is very high, which greatly increases the difficulty of prevention and control of the epidemic. At the same time, Omikon still has a certain pathogenic force, and the disease rate of the elderly and other vulnerable people is much higher than expected.  Second, ""Shanghai has a population of about 25 million, which is a very aging city. Once you lie flat"", it is likely to cause the elderly and other fragile people to be severely ill and death, and unbearable. ""Wu Huanyu said, looking at it"" The countries and regions that lie flat, such as European and American countries, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in our country, and Omikon has a serious threat to the health of the elderly, and even a large number of deaths have occurred.  In this Shanghai epidemic, the elderly over 60 years of age occupy a considerable proportion of infected people. These elderly people often have basic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and even tumors. After infection with Omikon, their health is more prominent.  Third, if the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" policy is not adopted, the consequences that may not be predictable may occur. In a large population in Shanghai, if the number of infected people is out of control, the virus may have a stronger variety of pathogenic strains in the process of constantly copying and mutation. ""The virus variation direction we observe is that the communication is stronger and relatively milder. But in fact, the virus variation does not play cards according to the routine, and there is a lot of uncertainty."" Wu Huanyu said that once there is a result, once the occurrence of the occurrence of the occurrence, once the occurrence of the occurrence of the occurrence, once the occurrence of the occurrence, once the occurrence is caused The risk of mutant strains with stronger disease power is what we cannot bear.  The current situation of epidemic prevention is very grim. Can ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" do it? ""It can be achieved in my country to realize the social"" dynamic Zero-Covid '. ""Wu Huanyu analyzed that although Omikon's mutant strain spread quickly, as long as it was discovered early, early control, early treatment, cutting off the spread of communication, Protecting the sensible people can still control the epidemic in a timely manner. The ""weapons"" of my country's anti-epidemic are also continuously enriched: large-scale nucleic acid detection and antigen detection technology and capabilities have been continuously improved, and COVID-19 virus vaccination is promoted rapidly.  ""Although the epidemic situation is currently severe and complicated, for each positive infection, the disease control department still does not relax in the shortest time."" Wu Huanyu said that the municipal illness and control department combined with the new characteristics of the spread of epidemics spread , By understanding key information such as the method of discovery, vaccination, and secret personnel of each positive infection, quickly analyze and judge the characteristics, situation, and risk points of the epidemic, and propose targeted prevention and control measures.

Wu Qianyu, a first -level inspector of the Municipal Health Commission, introduced that the vast majority of confirmed cases are light, a small part is ordinary, and there are heavy types. There are currently 9 cases of heavy types, all of which are treated in designated medical institutions. Of these nine patients, 7 men and 2 women; 1 case was 33 years old, and the remaining 8 cases were elderly people, the youngest 70 years old, and the largest 93. They are accompanied by serious basic diseases and high-risk factors such as old age, and they have not vaccinated the COVID-19 virus vaccine.  At present, according to the ""COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (trial ninth edition)"", in accordance with the principle of one person and one plan, increase the treatment of rescue and carry out multi-disciplinary expert consultation. It is actively treating COVID-19 with the characteristics of severe patients with severe basic diseases. At the same time, strengthen the treatment of basic diseases, combine traditional Chinese and western medicine, and cooperate with the treatment of every patient.  Citizens are concerned that the community has been closed for a long time. Why are the positive infections that are constantly appearing?  Wu Huanyu, deputy director of the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that there are three factors that have been analyzed: First, the screening data has a certain delay. Nucleic acid screening work is very large. If there is a positive mixed pipe after inspection, it is also necessary to make a single review and review. For the detected positive personnel, the epidemic survey should be further carried out, and the review of the report was completed. Second, there are family aggregate communication. Family dissemination is currently the main communication channel. Generally speaking, when a infected person is found in the family, other family members may have been infected, but they are still in the latent period and will be detected in subsequent screening. Essence Third, at the stage of static management in the whole region, although residents are not enough to leave home, there are still many materials in circulation. If there are objects contaminated by viruses, infection is not caused after contact.  Wu Huanyu introduced that the current situation of the city's epidemic situation is complicated and severe, and flowing work is still an important means of prevention and control of the epidemic. On the one hand, focusing on the investigation of core flow information, and tracing the source of virus infection as soon as possible at the same time to determine close contact; on the other hand, strengthening the flow of collective units such as markets, construction sites, and enterprises. These collective units are dense and frequent, and they are likely to cause a clustered epidemic.",confirmed cases; the epidemic prevention and control;,

Why is ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" a way to persist? The reporter interviewed Qu Jieming, Party Secretary of the Party Committee of Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine.  ""The core concept of 'dynamic Zero-Covid' does not mean that there is no case in a region, but after the epidemic can control the epidemic at the fastest speed."" Qu Jieming explained that the inspection should be inspected and accepted. Closing, depending on, and depletion are the specific methods of science and effectiveness.  He pointed out that with the high propagation of the Omeck Rong mutant strains, there is also strong hiddenness. In this round of the Shanghai epidemic, up to 90 % of them are asymptomatic infections. If you want to judge if you are fever, sore throat, etc., you will undoubtedly miss a large number of infected people. ""'Inspection of inspections, receivables, and depending on the interception' point to cut off the transmission chain, that is, control the epidemic from the source, and reduce new cases.""  ""It should be treated"" is also the same important link. ""Many citizens believe that in this round of epidemic, there are not many severe patients who are simply caused by Omikon's mutant strains. Why should we consider 3 deeper problems in this way?""  According to Qu Jieming, first, if you do not do a good job of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", the high spread will make the virus spread among the natural groups of communities and streets. In areas where cases are growing faster, if they are not blocked, it is easy to overflow in large quantities. Second, although the symptoms of simplicity are mild, when the number of people infection increases, there will be coronary heart disease, insufficiency of heart function, old slow branch, lung qi, lung qi qi Basic diseases such as swelling, as well as patients with low immune function such as tumor patients, can easily lead to aggravation of basic diseases or become severe and critical illnesses. The proportion and progress of the COVID-19 19 will also be higher.  ""Take the northern hospital of Ruijin Hospital, which is undergoing COVID-19 designated hospitals, as an example. Among the patients who have been treated, there are about 15%of patients over 60 years old and 53 patients with hemodialysis. All severe patients are the elderly, and even patients over 85 years old. Among the patients who have been treated in the underworld in the severe care room, there are also COVID-19 mild, and general patients are significantly increased by the basic symptoms caused by COVID-19 virus infections. Avoid more than 500 avoiding 500 avoiding 500. A lot of infections in the elderly in Shanghai are one of the important significance of adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid ',"" he said.  Third, due to factors such as age and basic diseases, such the most vulnerable and susceptible people are people with the lowest vaccination rate of COVID-19 vaccine. Once the crowd infection base grows in the short term, the proportion of severe illnesses will also increase, which will not only cause the risk of medical resource crowding, but also the risk of infection with other hospitalized patients, leading to incomparable consequences.  ""Based on the above considerations, 'dynamic Zero-Covid' is the only correct mode that currently controls the base of the infected crowd and relieves the further spread of the epidemic.""

The meeting pointed out that the problems of poor logistics operation in the Yangtze River Delta and other areas of the Yangtze River Delta are more prominent. More effective and effective measures must be taken, focusing on the blocking point card to ensure the smooth operation of logistics across the country and strengthening the service guarantee of truck drivers.  The reporter's interview found that recently the Yangtze River Delta did temporarily close some highway entrances due to the prevention and control of the epidemic. Moreover, even at some normal open highways, there are still situations where freight logistics is not allowed. Some high -speed highways have long queues. A large number of truck drivers are unable to drop high speeds due to the itinerary code with stars or foreign license plates. Essence  The freight is like a fulcrum of a seesaw. One end is connected to the epidemic prevention and control, and the other side is connected to the market. Between the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of the economic and social development, all parts of the Yangtze River Delta are looking for a new balance.  Pass problem  ""Some time ago, our truck driver was stranded on the highway for a maximum of seven or eight days."" Wang Yanwei, assistant general manager of Jiangsu Sudong Logistics Co., Ltd. said that now, the truck drivers should bring the ""three -piece set"" on the road. , That is, the health code, itinerary card, and 48 -hour nucleic acid report, but at the highway checkpoint, there is a high probability that the pass is required, and the pass is usually valid on the day.  For a while, Wang Yanwei was busy applying for various pass permits: ""Some cities must have single tickets and single -piece receipts to apply for a pass. In the city, only the application of passenger and cargo drivers to deliver goods to the local factory. If there is no such premise, it will not be able to apply ... ""  Recently, Liang Sanbo, Vice President of Ningbo Logistics Association and head of the 99th Road Collection Card Internet Platform, has been sleeping less than 5 hours a day. Many truck drivers in Ningbo Beilun have been diagnosed with COVID-19 positive. Liang Sanbo screams for the prevention and control of the truck driver through the online circle of friends and WeChat groups. In his circle of friends, you can find the Ningbo epidemic The latest progress and the latest requirements for preventing and control of high -speed import and export epidemic. In addition to the pass, some places also require drivers to show various local ""code"", and they may not be synchronized between ""code"" and ""code"". Liang Sanbo received some drivers feedback: I don't know why I went out once, and I became yellow and red.  According to Chen Wen, an expert in the integrated development decision -making consulting expert of the Yangtze River Delta region and a researcher at the Nanjing Geography and Lake Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the presence of logistics management in the Yangtze River Delta is because the logistics management is still the ""daily management"" model. Public safety ""logistics mode, which causes contradictions. At the same time, some truck drivers lack strict epidemic prevention measures and self -discipline management. Cross -provincial transportation freely gets out of the car to cause risk of epidemic conditions in cities along the route. Conversely, it also leads to stricter management measures in various places. Very big influence. Chen Wen reminded that some cities mainly rely on issuing permits in freight management. One incident issued a temporary pass. It is difficult to get a large number of small and medium -sized enterprises.  The situation is improving  But the situation is improving. The Ministry of Transportation's Logistics Guarantee Coordination Work Mechanism Conference emphasized that it is necessary to establish a unified format, national mutual recognition, and handling a convenient passage to ensure the nationwide traffic of the pass. The management and control policy is unified.  Relevant departments have realized these issues. In response to the problem of obstructing the logistics chain of coastal ports such as Zhoushan Port in Ningbo, on April 8, Zhejiang issued a special urgency notice to make a special epidemic prevention and control and ensure the unblocked transportation of port container, and issue an effective pass permit for compliant trucks as the whole province as the whole province as the whole province. Provincial roads and vouchers in Hong Kong. The notice requires that the truck driver will be tested negative in the past 3 days, and the ""health code"" has not been to the high -risk area within 14 days and the ""health code"" is the green code. As a voucher for road traffic and entry in Hong Kong. On April 9, Liang Sanbo reposted the information in the circle of friends. However, a driver still reported that when he went to a city, his health code became yellow. The implementation of related supporting policies takes time.  In Suzhou under the influence of the epidemic, the logistics situation is also improving. Last month, Wu Xuejin, chairman and general manager of Suzhou Industrial Park Vortual Park Logistics Co., Ltd. and generally worried about logistics problems. Now she is optimistic: ""After investigation, the production of most companies in the park has not delayed."" Wu Xuejin said this sentence On the one hand, the operating efficiency of Shanghai Airport and Shanghai Port has been restored on the one hand. On the other hand, after groping, a relatively mature freight management measures have been formed in the park. ""Before the truck departs, we will notify the company to sign and upload the mobile phone positioning information authorization letter to apply for a temporary traffic permit for electronic cargo transportation on the platform of the Netcom Office; Later, it will be parked to load and unload the goods with a separate parking area with video surveillance as required; after the truck is completed and unloaded, the factory will send someone to escort the freight vehicle to the next operating place or the nearby highway entrance leaves the park, and at the end of the guidance end Upload photos. ""Wu Xuejin explained. At the same time, the Suzhou Industrial Park has also shifted to water transportation. The ""water transfer"" route from the park to Yangshan Port has been opened, which has made a group of original land transportation be changed to a more open waterway.

We must see the arduous prevention and control tasks, and we must strengthen the confidence of winning.  General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that we must always adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, adhere to the scientific and precise, dynamic Zero-Covid, and curb the spread of the epidemic spread as soon as possible. Adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is not shaken. This is the clear requirements of the central government. We must unify their minds, form a consensus, and firmly persist.  Some authoritative experts have repeatedly pointed out that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with Chinese reality, respects science, reflects the law, and has proved that it is completely necessary and obvious. It is a precious and valuable experience and must persist.  From Wuhan's defense war two years ago to normalized epidemic prevention and control, to the full chain of the full chain of Delta and Omikon, the past epidemic prevention and control experience showed that the concentrated advantage of strengths and ""dynamic Zero-Covid as soon as possible "", Can curb the diffusion of the epidemic as soon as possible, and maximize the"" win -win ""of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development.  In this round, we are facing Omecko's mutant strains, which are more spread and relatively weak. There has always been a point of view that Omikon is a ""large influenza"", but it should be noted that according to the WHO report, the cumulative number of deaths caused during a period of popularity may be far exceeding the flu, and even Delta even Delta Essence  China is a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, with a population of 60 and over 267 million, and the children's population exceeds 250 million. The ""one old and one small"" group is large in scale, and the immunity is relatively weak. If the epidemic has a scale rebound, the consequences are difficult to predict. The immune background of Chinese people is also different from other countries, and it is difficult to simply perform analogy.  The strong and effective epidemic prevention policy can effectively reduce the number of deaths and reduce peak values. This not only has undergone repeated verifications of Chinese practice, but also is also recognized by the international public health community. For the current China, ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is still the most economical and effective epidemic prevention and control strategy, which can better protect the weak immune people and win the initiative to further explore the more scientific and accurate normalized epidemic prevention and control prevention and control. , Winning time and space.  The essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast, and the other is precise. It is necessary to fully and accurately realize the intention of the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" general policy, and put forward a major test on the prevention and control of the epidemic and related tasks. As a central city, Shanghai has many important functions. The consideration of epidemic prevention measures must not only be based on itself, but also based on the whole country and the world to prevent diffusion, rebound, and overflowing. During this time, the cities in Shanghai were slowing down. In order to block the epidemic, we have taken control measures. These have brought many difficulties to the people's lives, but we need to understand that the difficulty and inconvenience of the moment are to restore the ultimate goal to recover as soon as possible as soon as possible as soon as possible. The city is running as usual; the operation of one place slows down to prevent the spillover of the epidemic, and to avoid the spread of similar epidemic in more places. We must have such dialectical thinking and overall awareness.  We must always keep in mind and adhere to the original intention of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" to truly realize ""people's supremacy and life first"". In order to achieve this goal, we must strictly implement the implementation of various measures to prevent and control the prevention and control of the epidemic.

This is an important node, an important step in restoring the city as usual.  But this is by no means a time to relax. The epidemic is still severe, and it must not be blindly optimistic; the prevention and control work is complex and difficult to solve the urgency and urgency of all kinds of urgency and urgency.  For many people, this resistance is an unprecedented battle. The epidemic greatly impacted the normal operation of this oversized city and brought a series of extreme challenges. Extreme states not only test daily levels, but also test the ability of emergency, but also test the mental state of all parties.  Winning this hardship, only perseverance, toughness, and mind. The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government repeatedly emphasized that at this moment, no one can drop the chain. When we see the epidemic prevention and control as a real big test, we must clarify the responsibility and the responsibility of fighting.  The battlefield must not be deserted, and everyone must adhere to their position and the line of defense behind them. ""People are here, positions are there."" This is our fine tradition and the iron law of war. At the critical moment, any defense may allow all the previous efforts to pay the east, which may disappoint the hard work of all citizens. We cannot allow it to happen.  For leading cadres at all levels in the city and the majority of Communist Party members, in the face of such extreme tests, all thoughts must be abandoned, and they must be struggling to charge themselves. The city is safe and orderly. This is a test of the mission of the original intention and the test of party spirit.  At this moment, there are undoubtedly various difficulties. If you have difficulties, you want to make every way to overcome difficulties. We must not be overwhelmed by difficulties, we must not defeat ourselves, otherwise we cannot explain to history and the people.  Shanghai is a heroic city, and heroes have achieved the baptism of storms. In the magnificent history of this city, there have been more than once ""backwater war"" and ""to turn the tide"", and it has turned ""impossible"" into possible. All of this depends on firm belief, relying on scientific methods, relying on the vigorous impulse to break through the customs, rely on the wisdom of opening the road in Fengshan and the waterfront bridge. Qi God.  ""Hainan, pursuing excellence, enlightened wisdom, and humbleness"" -From the city spirit of Shanghai, you can read the kind of ""soft to rigid"" temperament. This should be a city that is open, inclusive, innovative, respects science, and is rich in temperature. At the crisis, this should be a city that can persist and adhere to. It is a strong and unyielding city. It is a city that is courageous to eliminate difficulties, unremitting struggle, and pursuing victory.

Promoting the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to find out all the infected people in the community  The quality of the people of Shanghai, the understanding of prevention and control measures, and a high sense of responsibility make people fully appreciate the confidence that the unblocking time will come soon.  Yesterday afternoon, the head of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission's COVID-19 epidemic response work leading group, the executive deputy dean and professor of the School of Public Health and Health of Tsinghua University, Liang Wannian in Shanghai at the current stage of Shanghai's epidemic prevention and resistance, ""dynamic Zero -Covid's hotspots, such as the realization of the goal, the challenges faced by Shanghai, and other parties, they were interviewed by the media.  Liang Wannian said that now we have effectively curbed the rapid rise of the infected person's index, but we must also deeply realize that the number of infected people in Shanghai's daily reports is still high, and the epidemic situation is still severe and complicated. We must not take it lightly. Essence  Concentrated isolation is necessary in the current situation  Liang Wannian said that those who adhere to asymptomatic infections and patients with minor illnesses are concentrated in isolation. This is determined by my country's general strategy of ""external prevention input and internal defense rebound"" and the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Promoting the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to find out all the infected people in the community, and then implement centralized isolation management and give corresponding treatment. In this regard, it is clear: First, Omikon's strains spread quickly. If those with non-symptoms and mild patients are isolated at home, they may cause renewal infections to their families, resulting in extensive spread and ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" Time is extended, and the goal of Zero-Covid cannot be achieved in a short time. Second, from the perspective of global epidemic situations, scientific research shows that asymptomatic infections and mild patients are also contagious. Third, at home isolation requires conditions, to ensure that the family has corresponding isolation conditions, while monitoring the development of the infected person's disease. If the elderly and other fragile persons such as their homes areolate, they may not be able to monitor and discover them in a timely manner, nor can they be treated in a timely manner.  Liang Wannian emphasized that Omikon's strains are mainly spread through the respiratory tract, but many domestic and foreign studies have shown that they can also spread through direct contact.  If the asymptomatic infected person and mild patients are isolated in the family, there are always risks of communication risks in the sewer, ventilation system and other facilities. Shanghai has a large population density, and there are many towers and villages in the city. Some families share the bathroom and the kitchen, and there are many migrants. Assuming that there are asymptomatic infections and mild patients, they will form rapid spread through contact, forming an invincible trend Essence Of course, some special groups such as infants and young children, the elderly, and the disabled can indeed be unable to achieve centralized isolation. In this regard, professional institutions and professionals must be judged to ensure that their home isolation has corresponding protective conditions and can achieve continuous condition tracking management. Essence Concentrated isolation is to ensure the health of the people and the safety of life. It is still necessary in the current situation.  Most of the continuous report infected are because of active screening  Liang Wannian said that the number of infected people in Shanghai has been reported for many days. The main reasons include: First, the city of Shanghai conducts antigen detection and nucleic acid detection. Through active response, the infected person who has not been found before was found. Second, there is a wide range of community transmission in the Shanghai epidemic. It must be discovered by active screening. Without this step, the number of infected people will increase. The number reported every day shows that the static management and screening of the whole area play a role, and it also shows that the Shanghai epidemic is now on a high -level platform area. We must realize that the discovery and isolation treatment of infected people and close contacts takes time. There is a process of gradually discovering, managing, and cutting off the chain. At present, Shanghai is in the stage of ""surrounding and drying"" the epidemic.  If the unblocking is conditions, it is necessary to ensure that the transmission chain is cut off  Liang Wannian said that Shanghai is currently implemented in static management. The concept of unblocking is to relieve static management in the whole region. The unblocking includes multiple levels, some are unblocking of urban surfaces, and some are unblocking in communities and streets. The unblocking conditions and situations at different levels are different. We can see that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have studied unblocking in accordance with the national prevention and control standards and specifications. When the community was unlocked one by one, the city surface was unblocked.  Liang Wannian emphasized that unblocking has conditions and standards. To ensure that the transmission chain is cut off and no continuous dissemination, the newly discovered infected people are in the field of vision, rather than actively seeking or vision. I believe that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, under the unified command and deployment of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, through the active efforts of various industries and front lines, especially the extensive participation of ordinary people in Shanghai, the time will come soon.  Liang Wannian believes that from the perspective of epidemic prevention and control, the key to solving the problems of blocking points, difficulties, and key points is to do the following aspects. First, quickly screen the source of the infection, that is, the infected person, and quickly transfer to the designated hospital for treatment. If there is no fast transfer and treatment, the source of the infectious source will still cause continuous spread in the community. Second, find out close contact with the close contact with the accurate epidemiological survey, and quickly transfer to the corresponding isolation point. Third, firm confidence, adhere to the overall strategy of ""external prevention input, internal defense rebound"", the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", grasp the implementation of various established strategies and measures, and ensure that the responsibilities of the four parties are really landing. It is the territory, departments, units, and individuals formed a joint force to resist.  Pay special attention to the prevention and control  Regarding the risks and challenges that may occur in the Shanghai outbreak in the future, Liang Wannian said that resistance to epidemic is a systematic project and major project, and firmly moves towards the goal of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". First, how to truly achieve ""bed and other people"", For the infected people diagnosed and screening, whether they are squares or designated hospitals, they must have sufficient bed treatment to prevent ""people waiting for beds"". In the same way, those who have comprehensively and accurately identify close contact and close contact with the secondary contact cannot be missed. The missing is to leave the risk of Mars and the risk of spreading. Wait.  Secondly, the spread of Shanghai is mainly in the family, but there are many large enterprises and factories in Shanghai in Shanghai. These enterprises are required to ensure the normal operation of the city and the economic and social operation. Implementation of various prevention and control measures. In case of loss, once the introduction of the source of infection, a local epidemic outbreak may be formed. Similarly, institutions such as schools, nursing homes, children's welfare homes, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions are defended as the top priority. It is necessary to strictly guard against death. We must effectively formulate various plans, and to truly implement various prevention and control measures and implement closed -loop management.  Third, we must pay special attention to the prevention and control of the elderly, children, and people with basic diseases. The proportion of people over 60 years old in Shanghai is relatively high, and the absolute number is also large. In this regard, whether it is the government, the relevant departments, or the people, we must deeply recognize the urgency and formulate various methods, such as further strengthening vaccine vaccination, especially improvement The vaccine vaccination rate for the whole process, prevent infection, reduce the rate of severe illness and mortality. Effective vaccination can have more than 90%of efficiency to prevent severe illnesses and death.  Fourth, people who pay attention to ensuring the normal operation of Shanghai cities, such as water and electricity maintenance guarantee personnel, courier brother, transportation industry personnel, public security police officers, medical staff, etc. It is fine, strengthen and strengthen, and implement responsibilities to ensure that these people are not infected. Once the infection can be found quickly. Ensuring the medical and health needs of 25 million people have always been a key task. We have seen that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have taken a series of effective measures to ensure the supply of normal medical and health needs of the people. The key is how to quickly and effective landing. This is also a challenge. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that children's immune planning, maternal and child health care, etc. should be implemented in accordance with procedures and requirements.  Shanghai people's quality and sense of responsibility are fully appreciated  In the end, Shanghai also faces the challenge of foreign defense input. As an international metropolis, many overseas flights come in every day. The work of foreign prevention input cannot be relaxed. Always adhere to the character of the characters.  Liang Wannian said that in the face of risks and challenges, each region and each unit should carefully sort out, take measures, implement responsibilities, make plans, and implement the prevention and control measures for various epidemics. Shanghai is capable of dealing with these challenges. From the perspective of experts, I have always felt that the people of Shanghai have a high degree of altruisticism. The quality of the Shanghai people, the understanding of prevention and control measures, and a high sense of responsibility have made people fully appreciate. Shanghai's medical and health systems and other departments, the professional level and professionalism of dedication, are also worth learning and praise. Shanghai's urban management capabilities, both at the urban level and at the community governance level, have good foundations and conditions. Our common enemy is the virus. We are compared with the disease of COVID-19. As long as everyone is highly unified, it will be unified into the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy.",infected; general policy; Shanghai; close contact; mild patient;,

""I will emphasize here that for discharge and discharge of medical observer, the territory must be connected, allowing them to go home, not to stop, and care about them at the same time and cooperate with their home health monitoring.""  It can be said that although the number of infected people in this round of epidemic is still high, infected people who have met the standards of discharge have begun to return to the community. At the same time, at the press conference of the epidemic prevention and control work yesterday, the director of the Municipal Health and Health Commission also mentioned, ""From the perspective of current research and clinical experience, COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged. They have produced corresponding antibodies in their bodies. According to the study of illness and control experts, cases that have not been observed have not yet been observed. I hope that family members and communities will not have to worry about this, let alone discrimination. ""  However, since you need to continue to monitor home health after returning to the community, what else do patients and infected people pay attention to? Is it necessary for neighbors to worry? The reporter invited Wang Xinyu, deputy chief physician of Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University to answer.  Wang Xinyu said that the so-called ""Fuyang"" problem that citizens are most worried about referring to the COVID-19 infected person for a period of time after the nucleic acid detection is negative, and the nucleic acid test is positive again. ""Now many studies have found that after the recovery of COVID-19 infected, even if the nucleic acid can detect a trace, that is, the CT value is rarely contagious when the CT value is between 35 and 40.""  Because of this, in March, the latest ""New Coronatte Pneumonic Pneumonia Diagnosis Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)"" (hereinafter referred to as the ""Diagnosis Plan"") changed the requirements of the nucleic acid detection value in the discharge standard. The CT value of the N gene and the orf gene is ≥35, and the sampling time is at least 24 hours. It meets the nucleic acid testing standard discharged from the hospital (at the same time it is necessary to meet the clinical standards). ""So if you are infected with the discharge standards or lifting the isolation standards, generally, it will not cause the infection of people around you.""  Similarly, Zhang Wenhong, the director of the National Infectious Disease Medical Center and the leader of the Shanghai COVID-19 medical diagnosis and treatment expert group, previously introduced the new version of the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Plan"", "" , To allow the infected person to return to normal life as soon as possible, reduce the economic burden during isolation, but also save the corresponding quarantine houses and other social resources, so that the ability of the entire society to cope with the epidemic situation will be further improved without causing the crowding of isolation resources. Based on diagnosis standards After shortening the isolation period, the probability of Fuyang will be very low; according to our research, even if the yang is in, the level of nucleic acid is already very low, and basically it has not caused second transmission due to Fuyang. ""  However, Wang Xinyu also reminded that when the heavenly home health monitoring was performed after the discharge of isolation management or was discharged, the relevant personnel should still wear a mask. Those with conditions should live in a single -player room with good ventilation to reduce close contact with the family's close contact with the family members. , Divide in diet, do well in hand, and avoid going out.  In addition to the ""worry"" of neighbors, some discharges themselves are also ""tangled"": Can it be used by the items used in the square hospital or medical institutions? Wang Xinyu said that before discharge, the items that the patients and infected people were brought home were disinfected by the hospital. If you also want to disinfect the disinfection agent, ""If you need to dilute,"" The disinfection agent must be used strictly according to the instructions and then used to avoid damage to the respiratory tract; it is best not to spray alcohol in the room to avoid degeneration and fire. ""In addition, after returning to home life It is difficult to survive in the room temperature for a long time.  ""After 7 days, it can be said that it is a very safe period."" He said that if the patients and infected people can abide by the above practices, they will not cause any infection to the neighbors. Disclosure of COVID-19 infected recovery. ""On the contrary, the community should be more concerned about them and provide them as much as possible for them.""

This group of ""community head geese"" must organize the implementation of seal control measures, arrange domestic garbage collection and transportation, and ensure that the express delivery and takeaway of the residents must be exposed to no contact distribution, and the nucleic acid detection and sampling order must be maintained. Patients and elderly people should seek medical treatment and find them; government supplies distribute them, find them; those positive infected people transfer, and they also need to help them ... ""The door you can't go out is the home where they can't go back."" It is the true portrayal of many village party organization secretaries.

After supporting the three residential areas in support of three residential areas, Su Ying, the secretary of the party branch of Tianlin Shisan Village, Xuhui District, was so hoarse, but still straightened his back: "" Don't be afraid. ""  At the most difficult time, Su Yan was the ""backbone"" of community workers and residents. On March 8, Tianlin Sanshi Village received a notice that the community needs to be closed. The young residential district secretary and the director of the neighborhood committee have never experienced such a battle, and they are instantly a little embarrassed. After receiving a call from the street, Su Yan did not hesitate to promise to reinforce. Help to maintain the order of nucleic acid detection, let the elderly and children withdraw from the team, line into a team alone, and allow the power of volunteers to concentrate where there are places.  The Secretary of the resident area of Tianlin Fourteen Village was hospitalized for illness, and Su Yan once again became the ""firefall captain"". This time, she hit the floor shop in the neighborhood committee for more than ten days. Su Yan's dedication was seen by the residents. From the beginning of dozens of complaints every day to the establishment of more than ten volunteers later, the emotions of residents slowly calmed down. ""I believe that nothing can't be solved. I am ready to be, wherever I need me, I will go."" Su Yan said.  Du Jiamin, the secretary of the general branch of Zhaojia Garden residential District, Yichuan Road Street, Putuo District, also lived in the office. The mobile phone was turned on for 24 hours. ""This is also a reassurance for residents.""  ""The community is closed, and the two groups of medical staff will come to your community around 4 pm. They must complete the nucleic acid sample tasks of all residents before 11 pm."" Du Jiamin received a call from the superior. There are more than 900 households in the Zhaojia Garden residential area, and the elderly account for more than 50%. She took out the map of the community, designed the plan with everyone, mounted the charts, took out all the tables of the neighborhood committee, and placed under each residential building. The efficiency of this ""division and drying"" method is fully reflected in the two nucleic acid detection.  Du Jiamin also increased the office mobile phone of the neighborhood committee from one to 4, and announced the number to the residents to increase the connection rate of residents' consultation telephones. 24 -hour special answers to solve various problems such as eating, medical treatment, and certification of residents.

Give a team that is willing to dedicate  ""After the 70s"", Su Yan said that she was confident to do a good job of preventing and controlling the community epidemic, because there were a group of volunteers willing to contribute. Du Jiamin, the ""post -80s"", also said that a group of young volunteers struggled with her and gathered ""the fire of the stars"".  Good at organizing the power of the community, this is a successful cheat for community workers to become ""head geese"".  Lin Longquan, the secretary of the party branch of the Yaojiang Resident District Party of Banjingyuan Road in Huangpu District, has a deep understanding of this. After receiving a notice from the Sealing and Control of Yaojiang Garden, Lin Long summoned the community party branch and deputy secretary, the deputy director of the industry committee, the leader of the volunteer team, the property manager and the community workers to hold an emergency meeting. The plan quickly assembled and established the ""Yaojiang Community Party Pioneer Pioneer"".  Lin Longquan specifically mentioned ""collaborative combat"". He said: ""In the collaboration of various departments such as streets, disease control departments, community hospitals, public security systems, urban transport systems, community party organizations, industry committees, neighborhood committees, property companies, special security teams, etc. Fortress and security barrier, we believe that victory is ahead.

""  Judging from the chat history, this is a person with ulterior motives to move flowers and getting flowers, making rumors maliciously, and creating panic. It is reported that the public security department has been investigating.  Rumors deliberately use the live broadcast screen  The Shanghai rumor platform found that the chat record spread on the Internet deliberately hidden the dialogue's avatar and net name, but used the live broadcast screen of the ""Shanghai release"" platform listing epidemic prevention and control work. It can be confirmed through the screen that this is the scene of the Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference (147th) held on the morning of April 8.  On the same day, Wu Qianyu, a first -level inspector of the Municipal Health and Health Commission, Jin Chen, deputy director of the Municipal Housing and Construction Commission, and Fan Jia, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Dean of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University. The whole process did not introduce the content related to community group purchase, let alone a notice of ""suspending group purchase"".  The company did not receive a notice of stopping  The Shanghai rumor platform for verification from a number of group buying service providers has received a response from ""not receiving a suspension service notice"".  Hema neighboring is providing group purchase services for communities that are more prominent in ""difficult to buy food"". According to Hu Dalei, the person in charge of the business, the current group purchase service is normal, and the daily delivery volume has exceeded 30,000.  Ding Dong ’s buying food also said that the group purchase was not stopped, but due to the previously affected capacity, some group purchase orders had distributed delay, so the enterprise suspended the“ neighborhood group ”service in some areas. However, with the support of all parties, the ""neighborhood group"" is about to recover, and the service of the front positions in the city will be further recovered.  Based on the demand for supply, Guangming Dairy has temporarily added products such as group temperature milk, milk powder and other products. They said that they did not receive any notice on pause group purchase, and the group purchase of normal temperature milk, milk powder and other products was carried out normally. At the same time, the service of booking fresh milk through ""ordering"" is gradually recovering.  There are many reasons for group purchase suspension  However, some service providers also said in an interview that group purchase services are closely related to distribution capabilities, so the service provider will adjust the scope of service according to the distribution capacity. Some community residents received the ""Group Purchase Paramounting Notice"", sometimes a shortage of distribution capabilities for a company.  The Shanghai rumor platform noticed that due to the more concentrated community group purchase in the near future, some communities have also issued relevant notices. It is recommended that residents choose suitable group purchase products, which not only leaves the capacity to more needed people, but also avoid increasing community volunteer distribution of necessary items. Workload.  According to the Shanghai rumor platform, some communities are worried that the number of group purchases will increase. If improper management will cause cross -infection, and will not support residents' group purchase. Some group purchase suppliers cannot complete the order because of their limited service capabilities.  It can be seen that the rumor's intentional use of the live screen screenshot of ""Shanghai Release"" to spread the news of the ""pause of group purchase"" is the use of the public's trust in ""Shanghai release"". At the same time, the rumors deliberately hidden the dialogue avatars and net names to cover up their identity. In this regard, the Shanghai rumor platform calls on the majority of netizens to carefully identify the unknown sources and understand the information through authoritative channels. At the same time, the Shanghai Rumor Platform also recommends the territorial management department and group purchase service provider to do a good job of interpretation of residents and consumers to avoid misunderstanding due to poor communication.

Many netizens say that some information does not seem to be true, but they can't find an authoritative explanation, hoping to verify and clarify. While verifying the facts, the Shanghai rumor platform also analyzes the birth and dissemination process of these rumors  ""Personal guess"" seems to be splendid  ■ The screenshots of the group chat can only show a part of all the chat content, which gives a few opportunities for a few good things to break the chapter. Netizens speak in the group, especially when guessing the reason, they should be more cautious  The Shanghai rumor platform found that it was one of the reasons for the rumor to release the guessing news at will.  On April 6, the community where the reporter was located was undergoing nucleic acid testing. After two -thirds of the residents of the community completed the test, the residents suddenly appeared in the group of property. ""Today's nucleic acid testing is over, the doctor has just received a notice, and all of them have been suspended. The residents' groups were questioned, but the property and industry committee could not answer these questions about everyone. Some residents said that the suspension of testing was because ""doctors and nurses were infected.""  Subsequently, some residents who knew the situation said that many areas have in batches. The Property and Industry Committee also immediately appeaned residents, saying that there was no collective infection of medical staff, and will be reported in a timely manner. At this time, the resident who said ""medical collective infection"" said that this was just the result of his guessing.  From the rumors recently clarified by the Shanghai rumor platform, many rumors come from speculation, especially in group chat. For example, there were previous rumors that ""the"" big white ""stationed in a community in Shanghai."" After verification, the rumors originated from an owner in the small district to send individual speculation into the chat group, and then spread by screenshots.  ""Goodwill reminder"" is hard to say goodwill  ■ ""Goodwill reminder"" and ""enthusiastic help"" cannot be a reason to make rumors or rumors. When spreading or forwarding reminders and helping information, it is recommended  In fact, many ""goodwill"" may be misunderstood in a very time. There is a case: Some readers told the Shanghai rumor platform that the residents reported in the community group that an old man in the community strongly stated that he would go out to buy food. Residents felt that the elderly might not ""grab"" the dishes online and decided to launch a career to live alone. At this time, someone who knows the truth tells the residents that all the elderly people in the community have been registered by the neighborhood committee and arranged for a special person or volunteer to do the service. Rest assured that others can help buy and insist on going out by themselves.  The reader said that fortunately, the relationship between the neighborhoods of the community has always been harmonious, and some people explain the situation, otherwise, if someone takes a video of the elderly with grass -roots cadres and volunteers, plus similar to ""Lonely Living alone will grab vegetables for help for help for help Did you also spread the rumors?  ""Intimate Relations"" gain trust  ■ Many netizens tend to believe in rumors that claim to come from intimate relationships. In fact, rumors also know that ""intimate relationships"" are easier to gain people's trust  There are some rumors that are closely related to the lives of citizens, from various ""intimate relationships"" that cannot be scrutinized. Recently, the two rumors related to ""My Sister's Friend"" are quite typical: one called ""my sister's friends who can't accept the child alone and treat it alone""; Suicide. "" After verification, both messages were rumors. The first is that netizens compiled the news of Taoistory to make ""friends' affairs"" sharing with her sister, and was spread by her sister with ""my sister's friend's experience"". These two netizens have been criticized by the police. Then a rumor processed the dialogue between the sisters and became a new rumor.  There is also a rumor of ""Epidemic Prevention"". Since the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, it has been spread on the Internet as a publisher such as ""relatives' children"" and ""neighbor doctor friends"". Both were rumored.  ""Moving Flowers and Wood"" is used to the use of means  ■ The phenomenon of moving flowers and wood, Zhang Guanli Dai is quite common in video rumors. The publisher of this kind of video cannot come up with the evidence of ""I am on the spot"" that is convincing. Netizens need to leave one more heart to see such videos  In the process of verifying and verifying, the Shanghai rumor platform also encountered many citizens with a sense of justice, actively provided rumors, and said ""no"" to the rumor through complaints, reporters, and publishing platforms.  For example, residents in Shanghai provided a case to the Shanghai rumor platform: When they performed nucleic acid testing, they filmed the relevant videos of volunteer services and published it on social platforms. At the same time, they were also matched with the text that expressed gratitude to volunteers. Unexpectedly, a video from the media reported the video shot by the residents of the residents to the ""one man's maintenance of nucleic acid testing order with a physical conflict with people"". The residents of the community are very angry: ""The"" Dabai 'in our community is very serious, the residents are very cooperative, the detection order is very good, and the videos we posted clearly make the gratitude. After the grafting was used, it was further diffused. At present, the Shanghai rumor platform has urged relevant platforms to delete videos.  The Shanghai rumor platform found that phenomena such as moving flowers and woods, Zhang Guanli Dai are quite common in video rumors. The publishers of such videos cannot come up with convincing evidence; on the contrary, the clarity and integrity of related videos are very different from normal shooting.

Such people are most likely to have diseases. ""Once the"" dynamic Zero-Covid ""policy is shaken, it is very likely that the Hong Kong epidemic situation is likely to occur.""  ■ Combine the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" with comprehensively promoting the elderly in vaccination and enhanced needles. Through ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it will win the latter, thereby greatly reducing the severe disease rate and death rate  At present, the situation of the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control situation is complicated and severe. There are some saying on the Internet that ""Omikon is a large influenza"", ""lying down"" and ""coexisting"" is the right way. As a large -scale cabin manager, Zheng Junhua, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, has recently moved to the new International Expo Central Hospital from the Expo Exhibition Center Hospital, and still serves as the chief commander. In his opinion, for this epidemic, ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is still the most economical and effective prevention and control strategy to control the epidemic. Essence  Facing the virus, you must not take it lightly  ""From the early 2020 experience in Wuhan, to this experience in the square hospital, we can all deeply understand that the spread of the Omikon strain BA.2 is already faster than we run. At a critical moment that must be unified and unified, it can quickly and powerful can fight this battle. ""Zheng Junhua said that according to the patients in the square hospital, the virus is strong, and it still has the characteristics of scattered, gathering, and hidden characteristics. It is different from the previous subtypes of the COVID-19 virus. In addition, the two major difficulties are that Shanghai has a population of 25 million and has a high social liquidity; the global academic community has insufficient understanding of the specific infection of BA.2 strains and the sequelae of the occurrence.  Zheng Junhua said that in this round of epidemic, a patient with severe illnesses is under treatment. ""Many people think that there are fewer patients with severe illnesses, and this virus is not so terrible. In fact, to some extent, this is because the proportion of vaccinations in Shanghai residents and the overall Shanghai medical system are not defeated in the efforts to defeat the efforts. , But this is not a reason for us to take it lightly. ""He pointed out that there are many uncommon for children and elderly patients in the square hospital hospital. Such people are the most likely to have diseases. Patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, tumors, and hemodialysis in the treatment, once the virus infection is superimposed, it will easily lead to severe danger. ""  In particular, he mentioned that there are not many infected people in the square hospital in the square hospital. ""The young people are recovering rapidly, but the infection of children and the elderly will also bring a heavy burden on the family. Once the"" dynamic Zero is shaken -Covid 'policy is very likely to occur in the Hong Kong epidemic. ""  Zheng Junhua said that at present, in the New International Expo Center's square cabin hospital, more than 3,500 medical staff from Tianjin, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces and cities and cities and cities in Shanghai and the Shanghai Taoist are in the city. It is gradually solving that the source of living security objects from all over the country is constantly entering Shanghai. ""We feel the cohesion and warmth, and the national power has become the foundation of our dynamic Zero-Covid.""  Yesterday, Jilin City announced the realization of Zero-Covid. After 37 days of continuous combat, everyone saw the results of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Zheng Junhua said that this is a big test to test the governance power of all levels, all levels of the regions of Shanghai, and the combat effectiveness of medical staff. The more difficult it is, the more we have the courage, responsibility, confidence, and positive energy. ""Before the medical team of Renji Hospital set off, I said to the team members: 'We must be firm, firm, tough, calm, calm, confident, professional, dedicated, and scientifically to complete this task'. Optimistic and scientific treatment, take out the mind, professionalism and enthusiasm of the city in Shanghai, I think, the dawn of victory is not far away. ""  Promote the inoculation of the elderly  Recently, many questions on the Internet questioned the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" epidemic prevention and control general needle needle, advocating ""coexist with the virus"". What do you think of immunology experts? The reporter interviewed Researchers Li Bin, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Shanghai Transportation University of China yesterday. He said: ""Support Shanghai's"" dynamic Zero-Covid 'General Principles, and also calls to combine this policy with comprehensively promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to comprehensively promote the elderly. The person wins time, thereby greatly reduced the severe rate and death rate of COVID-19 infection. ""  According to Li Bin, according to some experts estimates, the propagation coefficient (R0) of the COVID-19 virus Omikon variable strains is 7.0, so the communication coefficient of Omikon BA.2 is as high as 9.1. This means that when there is no external force intervention, and at the same time, everyone does not have immunity, and each person who is infected with Omikon BA.2 on average will transmit the virus to 9.1 people. ""In human history, the virus with such high R0 value has never been eliminated."" Li Bin analyzed that some studies have found that under the conditions of 25 degrees Celsius and 45%-55%, Omikon is on the plastic surface surface The survival time is up to 200 hours. So if Omikon BA.2 continues to be popular around the world, it is difficult for us to ""complete Zero-Covid"".  However, this does not mean that we cannot carry out ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". The goal of this policy is not zero infection, or there is no local case. Instead, when local cases occur, the relevant departments should control the virus infection chain in a short time and cut off the infection chain.  In Li Bin's view, ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" should be combined with the COVID-19 vaccine for the elderly over 60 years old. Since the recent large -scale epidemic in Hong Kong, research data shows that whether it is an active vaccine or MRNA vaccine, after three needles are vaccinated, the severe protection rate of the vaccine has exceeded 95%. It can be seen that the effect of three -shot vaccination, including enhanced needles, is very significant to the protection of the elderly. Therefore, he suggested that Shanghai and other provinces and cities must do a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic in the future, and it is necessary to take the enhanced inoculation of reinforced needle in the age of 60 as a key task. The government can send medical staff to serve in various communities to vaccinate more elderly people.  ""After this wave of epidemic appeared in Shanghai, the severe gra for the infected persons was extremely low, which caused many people to have the my illusion of"" Omikon ""similar to influenza."" Li Bin pointed out that the severe rate of severe severe rate is actually the first -class medical conditions in Shanghai. The detection of large -scale nucleic acid detection as soon as possible and the high vaccination rate of virus carriers as soon as possible. If Omikon spreads across the country, the severe rate of severe illness in certain regions will not be so low.  The immunologist said that the research data of Chile's vaccine enhanced needle (2 stitches vaccine+1 acupuncture virus vector vaccine) and the real -world research data of Hong Kong can be speculated that it is important to vaccinate the third needle vaccine as soon as possible. ""No matter what kind of COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine enhanced needle can have a good anti-severe effect.""",Fang Cabin Hospital; vaccination; active vaccine; epidemic prevention and control;,

Disinfection before entering the outlet. ""Government departments provide us with free nucleic acid testing. Sometimes in order to ensure the courier outlets start in time, the relevant testing staff will do nucleic acid test at 3 am.""  ""To be honest, I was surprised to see that express delivery is a source of infection on the Internet."" Wu Qiang said that he was not an expert. This kind of infection was not possible, but he had been in contact with the package for so many years. He did not encounter this situation. ""It is indeed strict and cautious to treat the epidemic, but don't be too panic.""  Wu Qiang introduced that when the express arrived at the Shanghai Transport Center, it would be necessary to disinfect it. At the outlet, not only the vehicle will be fully eliminated, but the unloading conveyor belt is also equipped with an automatic atomization disinfection device, which will eliminate the package again. During the epidemic, the courier also had no contact delivery and transferred to consumers after the community.  Persistent courier is becoming an important force to ensure Shanghai's material transportation. Fengxian Eastern outlets must not only help surrounding consumers deliver drugs such as medicines, but also undertake the task of transporting Fengcheng antigen testing kits. Like them, many courier brothers are actively investing in supply and transportation, sending thousands of households to life necessities and prevention supplies.  Takeaway adhere to the front line and upgrade epidemic prevention measures  In terms of takeaway distribution, many younger brothers still adhere to the front line of preventing resistance. Regarding the safety of distribution, Meituan stated that the delivery staff needs work certification, guarantee certificate, and 48 -hour nucleic acid certification ""three certificates"" to send orders.

At the same time, all staff at Meituan Station have completed nucleic acid testing and vaccination. The daily disinfecting of the site also strictly follows the relevant requirements of the epidemic prevention and control, such as disinfection in the morning and evening in the station, the temperature measurement of the staff twice a day, the delivery of the delivery box and the equipment for each delivery, etc.  ""Most of the takeaway brothers have been controlled in the community. We have upgraded the epidemic prevention measures to run the younger brother outside."" Yangpu District was hungry? The rider is required to submit anti -original negative certificates on the day before work, 48 -hour kernel acid negative proof, and at the same time measure the body temperature before you can get up. The meal box requires at least two morning and evening disinfection. The rider increases the frequency of changing gloves, masks, etc., and regularly disinfect the opponent's department during the order.  Also completed the upgrade of epidemic prevention measures is Hema. It is reported that Hema has set up a special class of epidemic prevention work to upgrade the system of preventing people, goods, fields, and warehouses.

The module reports the code scan and mobilizes party members in the patients to participate in voluntary service. In one day, more than 150 party members have reportedly reported out of more than 7,000 patients to register for voluntary service work.  ""Where do I need a person? I come to report!"" Mr. Lu, a patient, is an old party member and the first volunteer to register. On the first day of the Expo isolation and the treatment point, he lived in the H2 ward. After learning the news of the party members' ""double registration"", he immediately scanned the code to register. Now, he cooperates with medical staff every day to do a good job in the maintenance of nucleic acid testing and distribute meals to patients. ""Party members need to serve the people. When you see people, you need to"" stand up ""for the first time. It is necessary to help and help 'Dabai' to share the work.  Mr. Lu said that he was still a little scared when he entered the isolation point. The medical staff did their best to make a good responsibility. After a few days, the body began to improve. He used his own experience to appease the residents in the community group. Enhance autoimmunity.  Patient Xiao Zhang is a member of a college student. When he transferred from the foreign hospital to the H2 ward of the isolated collection point, he was accompanied by a slight fever. At present, the condition has improved. After learning that the party members have a bright status, she scanned the code for the first time and registered for registration. Essence  In the past few days, she has been helping patients who are older and who do not use smartphone functions to make appointment detection QR codes and query nucleic acid test reports in advance to prepare for the smooth work of medical care.  It is reported that the isolation point is intended to prepare for the establishment of a patient's temporary party branch, mobilize the patient party members to take the lead in participating in the management of the ward, play the role of the party organization's fighting fortress and the pioneering model of party members at the front line of the epidemic prevention and control, so that the party flag is high in the first line of the epidemic prevention and control. Gao fluttered.  Concentrated isolation point to carry out the first surgery  On the evening of March 31, the centralized isolation and treatment point of the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital received an emergency call: ""We have a patient here suspected that the gastric perforation is suspected, but the nucleic acid detection is abnormal, and the request is transferred to a designated hospital for surgery."" Preparation before surgery. ""While receiving the news, the relevant medical care is preparing to return to the resident to rest. It is learned that the situation is urgent, and all rushed back to the medical area.  The patient is a 45 -year -old man with basic diseases such as hypertension. During the sealing of the community, the neighborhood committee was urgently contacted due to abdominal pain, which was transferred to the outer hospital through 120, but the results were found abnormal when the nucleic acid testing was detected before admission. Due to the urgent, danger, and heavy condition of the patient, the Baoshan District Health and Health Commission coordinated and deployed for the first time, and transferred the patients to the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital for centralized isolation and treatment points.  When he came to Baoshan Courtyard, the patient had been painful for several hours, with painful expressions, sweating, breathing, and accompanied by fever. In daily diagnosis and treatment work, the perforation of gastrointestinal tract is ordinary surgery. However, at the centralized isolation point, it is necessary to ensure that the medical care is not infected, but also to complete the surgery accurately and smoothly.

In special periods, the difficulty of surgery has increased: thick isolation clothes, vision is partially covered by the goggles and protective masks, and multi -layer rubber gloves cause fingers to bend more laborious. However, these physical discomforts were quickly overcome by the professional ability and occupational literacy of medical staff. During the operation, patients were diagnosed with severe abdominal pollution with gastric sinus perforation, which confirmed that patients would have a dangerous judgment of life if they were not urgent. The doctor sutured and repaired the perforation site, and carefully washed the abdominal cavity. The entire surgery took less than 60 minutes.

According to this compliance, the residential community (unit, place) of the positive infection involves the grid unit and adjacent grid unit of the residential area (units, places) are classified as a sealed control area. There is also a series of regulations on the flow of personnel in the control area and prevention area. In this regard, a number of members of the CPPCC give suggestions on the prevention and control of the epidemic in the next stage.  Don't panic, don't panic, don't mess  From the perspective of Dong Jingcheng, member of the CPPCC member, the director of the Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Department of Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, and the director of the Fudan University Institute of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, due to the strong contagiousness of Omikon, as long as the susceptible person flows less and does not contact the virus, he does not contact the virus. It is the best protection for them; this proper static station is an effective way to cut off the transmission path for key areas; if everyone can avoid the infection of the virus as much as possible, the pathogen can gradually achieve the purpose of removing the pathogens to remove the pathogen body. Essence  Dong Jingcheng said that the previous round of grid -based ribinic acid screening of Pudong was initially set for 4 days to try to reduce the impact on economic and social life. If there is a concentrated outbreak in some areas during the disciplinary control and testing period, then 4 days of sealing control cannot solve the problem.

""We all have a scientific attitude in order to get out of this epidemic.""  Huang Gang believes that the current prevention and control of segmental partitions is the maximum likely to not affect the economic and external exchanges of the city. The biggest problem of Omikdon is that the speed of communication is particularly fast, and its symptoms have become difficult to identify. Therefore, through the detection of rapid global nucleic acid detection, everyone can effectively control COVID-19 dissemination without leaking the net. ""Because the installment is open in batches, some people who have been sealed may be worried, and there is no bottom in their hearts."" Huang Gang said that the mood of sealing and controlling residents is fully understandable. At this time, proper psychological adjustment needs , Taking this time as a period of rest.
