""Zhang Lumei, director of the Town Social Welfare Organization of Pengpu Town, who is responsible for operating Pengpu Town Elderly Cafeteria, told reporters that recently the market not only has tight vegetable supply, but also fluctuate. In the face of greater difficulties, Zhang Lumei still negotiates with suppliers and suppliers. , Find a relatively cheap source of food. On the evening of March 26, after Zhang Lumei communicated, a vegetable base in the Shanghai suburbs promised to send a car with a car price. Zhang Lumei was afraid of changes and waited in the cafeteria. Implementation. From 78:00 that night, I waited for more than 4:00 the next day, and then I came to this car with a parity dish. I didn't take a good rest overnight. Vegetables, etc., also donate vegetables from the cafeteria. The elderly cafeteria of Pengpu Town will give meals more than 600 elderly people in the town every day. Recently, Yonghe Home and other communities have accepted closed isolation or closed -loop nucleic acid screening. Many elderly people have been accepted. Many elderly people I am worried about whether I can eat lunch on time. ""The community is closed again, and the elderly can not delay for meals. ""Pu Shan Public Welfare Service Center is closely linked to the relevant neighborhood committees and community volunteers, and efficient linkage. The"" green channel ""of the meal delivery is for the first time to ensure food supply services. Most of the teams are retired elderly people. Each volunteer will deliver meals to dozens of elderly people in the morning. Zhang Jianguo, who is responsible for delivery of meals in Yangcheng Meijing Community, is worried that the community will suddenly be blocked. The lunch box on the rack downstairs, immediately contacted the head of the community security and the person in charge of the neighborhood committee to report the difficulty of the old man: ""Please help the meals as soon as possible to the elderly. ""Soon, the neighborhood committee implemented volunteers for him.

""This newspaper correspondent Gan Lixin reporter Tu Yu"" Love Restaurant ""divided the five -color care circle. ""Police Fan Xiaobin sent a hot meal for the old man, Wu Aunt Wu, and told a few more words again. After Shanghai launched a new round of block and grid nucleic acid screening, the area under the jurisdiction of the Xiangzhou Road Police Station of Jinshan Public Security Bureau met. There are problems. There are more than 20,000 elderly people over 60 years old, accounting for more than 52%of the total, and more than 1,800 elderly people who live alone in the elderly. For residential communities with severe aging, the police station decides to send police officers to settle in, and community workers with community workers Let's implement various emergency guarantees and people's livelihood security measures together to solve problems such as difficulty in eating, medical treatment, and help difficulties in the empty nest. After the sealing of the community on March 28, the police Fan Xiaobin first thought of the elderly in the community. I will use smartphones to buy food online, and I usually give dishes once a few days. Fan Xiaobin immediately contacted the neighborhood committee to distinguish the elderly population in the community according to the lonely old, lonely, old age, etc. , Blue pure old, green, and orange special ""five -color care circle, register and create, form a"" one person, one table "", especially the unified management of more than 30 elderly people who need special attention, and assume them to send them food and supplies.

Lao Fan immediately docked with the neighborhood committee and the community hospital. After negotiating from several parties, he decided to send someone to the door to heal the community hospital. On the morning of the 28th, the residents of Petrochemical Jiucun Community responded to the call and went to the nucleic acid testing point. The community police, Qiu Xiao, was worried that the old man Guo Guo, who lived in the district, was difficult to participate in nucleic acid testing and rushed to the elderly immediately. I heard that Qiu Xiao will be relieved after escorting all the way. Qiu Xiao first helped the old man to make a screenshot on the mobile phone, and then pushed the wheelchair to the test point. After completing the sample, he escorted the old man home. In just one morning, Qiu Xiao escorted his legs and feet. The elderly have participated in nucleic acid testing more than ten times. Reporter Pan Fengfeng special correspondent Xin Wenzheng Xin Wenzhuang's deep love chef helped the community to enter the closed management. A group of neighbors' enthusiastic help in a community in Anting Town, Jiading District made these problems solve. ""Today I will make these dishes for Master Jiang's house. How do you see?

"I did n’t go home for more than ten days, and worked for more than 12 hours a day",“Police“ Police ”across the river,Space,"Chief reporter Pan Gaofeng ""Thank you so much, you helped us busy, and you want you to put money. We are really embarrassed."" This is the third time I thanked Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, who lives in the Linyi Building of Dongfang Road. But she was pushed back. Lin Weibin is a community police at the South Pier Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Pudong New District. Since the occurrence of the epidemic, he has been fighting the front line of resistance. Until yesterday, he hadn't returned home for more than ten days. On March 30, Lin Weibin, who maintained order at the nucleic acid detection point, met Aunt Dong's family. ""At that time, she looked particularly anxious and helpless. Mr. Ge, her husband, had been anxiously saying something. I felt that something would be something, so I went to ask."" Seeing Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, 63, was overjoyed. ""Police Officer Lin, our children's medicine has been broken for more than half a month. I think he is a bit wrong, it is really anxious."" Lin Weibin stunned. Looking at Xiao Ge behind Aunt Dong, he found that his eyes were really manic. Xiao Ge is a psychiatric patient. Every month, his parents took him to the Shanghai Mental Health Center on No. 600, Wuxing Ping South Road, Puxi to see a doctor, and the condition has been well controlled. But since this epidemic, because of continuously being closed at home, the medicine has been taken for a long time. With Pudong Puxi promoted a new round of grid -based ribinic acid screening, cross -strait traffic interruption, and the distribution of medicines became a difficult problem. Aunt Dong and her husband were very worried about this. ""You do nucleic acids first, go back to the medical insurance card to give me a way, I come to find a way."" Lin Weibin comforted and reported to the police station immediately. After receiving the consent of the sub -bureau, he decided to run a trip to help Xiaoge with medicine. Lin Weibin did not set off immediately. He found several other neighborhood committees he had jurisdictionary and asked about the medication of mental patients. He found that there were still two cases of drug breaks. He also came to ask the medical insurance card. In order not to delay participation in nucleic acid testing, at noon that day, Lin Weibin drove to Wanping South Road without eating meals. With the help of a volunteer of the Municipal Commercial Committee, he contacted the hospital. Aunt Dong did not give enough money. He also paid for his own pocket and cooked the money to help Xiaoge with good medicine. However, the other two patients did not have seen a doctor at the Shanghai Mental Health Center before, and could not prescribe medicine according to regulations. Lin Weibin rushed back again, and inquired that they were usually seeing a doctor at the Pudong Yuandong Mental Health Center, and hurriedly drove over, finished the medicine, and delivered them one by one. When things were resolved, Lin Weibin was relieved. Aunt Dong's family was grateful and found that Lin Weibin also helped put the medicine money. He found Lin Weibin three times and wanted to return the money to him. This appeared at the beginning of the article. ""For the community police, it is also internal affairs to control the mental patient."" Lin Weibin told reporters that under the epidemic, many things that happened at all happened. ""It's hard to everyone. If you help, you can win a little more understanding and support."" In fact, ""difficult"" is Lin Weibin himself. On March 22, he was maintaining order at the nucleic acid detection point and suddenly received a notice. His community found a confirmed case and was about to be closed. The leader knew that Lin Weibin's wife was a doctor at Puonan Hospital. The child was in the third year of high school this year and did not order death. He made him decide whether to go home or stay in the front line. At that time, Lin Weibin called his wife. The wife was on duty and never answered. Hesitating again and again, he decided to last. ""It's not easy, you can do more or do more."" He hurried home, took two sets of clothes to change, and explained a few words with his son, and rushed back to the police station. Since then, he has been sleeping at the police station and never returned home. On the afternoon of March 30, Lin Weibin, who was busy after the community nucleic acid detection, was preparing to return to the police station. Suddenly discovered that 3 medical workers who had done nucleic acid testing in the community were running on the road. Catch it back and return without merit. He hurried up and asked what could help. It turned out that the three were nurses of the Oriental Hospital. Before wearing ""big white"" as nucleic acid that morning, they put the replaced clothes and three medical PDAs in a bag. Unexpectedly, the cleaner who received medical waste was not noticed, and it was taken away as a garbage bag. There are data scanning data in the three PDAs, and it is very valuable, and the three nurses have broken. Lin Weibin decided to help. He found that the nearby medical waste garbage was dispatched to dispose of the special disposal point to the West West Road of Pushan Road, and immediately drove the nurses and rushed over. At the scene, everyone couldn't help but take a breath: each garbage bag was piled up like hills. When will this be found? As Lin Weibin comforted everyone, he found the staff and asked what was the latest garbage, and then took the nurses to find a garbage bag and a garbage bag. After turning more than 30 garbage bags, nothing was obtained. At this time, a new car was transported. Lin Weibin asked the driver carefully and found that it was very likely that it was very likely to lose things on this car. Sure enough, after more than ten garbage bags, the clothes and the lost PDA of the nurse were among them! After the disinfecting, Lin Weibin sent the nurse back to the hospital again, so that he could eat something. ""In fact, there will be a lot of such things every day, helping the patients with medicine, sending the elderly for blood transmissions, and buying vegetables for residents ..."" Lin Weibin told reporters that these days, he gets up at 5 o'clock every day and send colleagues one by one to one by one to one by one. After ordering, I returned to the jurisdiction of the community and worked for more than 12 hours a day. Fight continuously. ""But who is not tired? None of the community workers and doctors and nurses I saw."" Lin Weibin said that he was a veteran, and he was transferred to the community police after retiring. ""Back to the place yesterday, with tea replacement, to celebrate the video of a few comrades -in -arms who had just lifted the isolation. Everyone was encouraging and said that I was good.""",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-01/8.htm,4/1/22,8th edition: Shanghai News,
Closed -loop epidemic prevention measures are intertwined with emergency surgery to save compatriots' eyes,"""Bright Relay"" more than 10,000 miles",Space,"Last night, the emergency mechanism under the emergency start of the epidemic prevention and control of the Eye, Ear and Nose and Earmine Hospital affiliated to the Fudan University had performed eye surgery for a patient with a retina that returned from the African Congo (cloth) to go back to China to help patients restore the light. The 38 -year -old patient was a Chinese crew working at the Congo (cloth) fishery company. He was wounded with a bomb -eye when unloading at the pier more than a month ago, and his left eye discomfort immediately appeared. Patients diagnosed the left -eye -based retinal disconnection in the Congo (Bud) capital Brazville's Zhonggang Friendship Hospital. Due to the limited local medical conditions, the hospital suggested that they return to China as soon as possible for surgery. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic reasons, according to the isolation requirements of international flights, the patient accepted a 21-day quarantine in the Congo (Bu), and Sia Baba, who transferred to Ethiosia for 8 days. In the end, the patient boarded a return flight with the help of a local diplomatic agency in China. In accordance with the requirements of domestic epidemic control, overseas returnees still need to continue to beolate after entering the country. During the isolation, the symptoms of patients gradually increased, and obvious visual decline and visual deformation began to occur. To his heart, during the isolation, the Shanghai epidemic was worsened. However, what the patient did not expect was that after he released the need for medical treatment on the social platform, the Jiading Health and Health Committee responded as soon as possible, and coordinated by the Municipal Health and Health Commission, and arranged to be treated by the Eye, Earmark Hospital affiliated to Fudan University. At a severe time of the epidemic, we must grasp the epidemic prevention, abide by the country's isolation principles for returning people, and ensure the patient's medical needs in a timely and effective manner. On March 31, the patient was sent to the Eye, Ear -Nose and Laystroke Hospital for emergency treatment through the 120 closed loop. Eye, ear, nose and throat hospitals are efficiently collaborated according to the emergency plan in the hospital. After the emergency department is sampling for patients, the patient quickly transferred the patient to the emergency room, and arranged an ophthalmological examination in place. Jiang Chunhui, an eye disease expert of the hospital, found that the patient's peripheral retina had crack holes and degeneration areas, and the retina was out of end to endanger macular areas. Obviously, the important central vision of patients has suffered serious damage and needs to be treated immediately. After fully communicating with patients, the hospital immediately takes epidemic prevention measures according to the requirements of the secondary prevention and control requirements of the epidemic. Director Jiang Chunhui was urgently in the negative pressure operating room that day to perform retinal reset for patients, and the operation was successfully completed. This morning, after the first day of the postoperative review, the patient's retina was closed well, and the retina had been calm. The patient thanked the hospital for emergency treatment. Zhou Xingtao, dean of the Department of Earlier, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, said that in order to save the patient's vision of the patient who returned to the motherland for medical treatment, the hospital worked together and responded in an emergency, accurate, efficient, and proper surgery under the prevention and control of the epidemic.

Li Qiang pointed out that the most important stage in the most vigorous prevention and control of the epidemic must be firm and uncomfortable. It is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and instructions, and go all out, do our best, and do this round of nucleic acid screening. , Strive to ensure the safety of citizens and the safety of the city. The second batch of regional nucleic acid screening work will be fully carried out on April 1, involving more personnel and wider coverage. In order to ensure the strong and orderly advancement of nucleic acid screening, relevant districts have paid close attention to the preparations of the seal control screening. Li Qiang came to a community on the South Dandan Road, Xujiahui Street, Xuhui District to check the closed management situation of the community, listened to the work reports such as residents' nucleic acid screening organization and people's livelihood security during the sealing control period, and inquire about the emergency medical ""green channel"" and personnel equipment situation. The cadres, medical staff, public security police, property security personnel, and community volunteers who adhere to the front line expressed condolences and thanks. He said that it is necessary to combine regional reality, more targeted deployment, refining the plan, and ensuring protection. It is necessary to make good use of big data, but also ""knock"" by households to ensure that nucleic acid screening is ""not leaking one household, not one person"". It is necessary to strictly control the management, control each building, patrol and every street, and ensure that the requirements of ""people are not flowing and not leaving the house"" are implemented. It is necessary to make full service guarantees, listen carefully to the residents' voices, solve the problem of urgency in a timely manner, and better consolidate the strong joint force of everyone's self -discipline and resistance. In order to speed up the detection speed of nucleic acid, a group of mobile nucleic acid detection vehicles have been put into use a few days ago. Li Qiang came to a neighborhood square in Jing'an District to learn about the surrounding residents of the mobile nucleic acid detection vehicle service, carried out the relevant situation of nucleic acid detection, and listened to the report on the improvement of the regional nucleic acid detection capacity to improve the relevant work. Li Qiang pointed out that the detection capacity of nucleic acid testing is related to the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention and control. It is necessary to focus on the current optimization of the organization, to reasonably allocate resources, promote the collaboration of the full process of ""collection, delivery, inspection, and reporting"", promote accurate matching and efficient operation; In the long run, we have worked more from the aspects of layout, equipment procurement, qualification approval, and training personnel training, and strongly support the development of relevant testing enterprises, laying a solid foundation for the convenience of citizens with the inspection. In the past few days, the brothers and cities have given strong support at a critical moment when the new round of nucleic acid screening work is promoted by the city. The testing teams of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places have arrived in Shanghai one after another. They could not take care of more, and they immediately put them into the nucleic acid sampling testing of the relevant communities. Li Qiang visited the comrades and representatives of medical staff on the spot. On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and the city, the people of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang and Anhui testing teams did not spare no effort and support for the inspection team of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. He said that in the face of the severe challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, the brothers and cities took the initiative to docking, close collaboration, watched assistance, joint defense and control, which fully demonstrated the deep friendship of the people of Shanghai. I believe that with the strength of the Yangtze River Delta and the provinces and cities across the country, we will be able to win the resistance and control of the epidemic. Li Qiang told the district and the street comrades to further strengthen the docking, communicate closely, and do a good job of service guarantee for supporting teams in other provinces and cities with their hearts and thoughtfulness. In recent days, our city has continued to strengthen the ""non -necessary non -leaving Shanghai"". From 00:00 on April 2, in addition to 48 hours of kernel acid test negative proof of kernel testing, the personnel from Shanghai must also provide anti -antigen detection negative certificates within 24 hours. City leaders came to Shanghai Railway Station to check railway operations and bus protection, understand the inspection of nucleic acids and antigen test results from Shanghai, visit the first -tier personnel of railway operations and transportation guarantee, and comrades who continue to fight on various fronts in cities Express thankfulness. Li Qiang said that it is necessary to resolutely adhere to the city's operations, and implement the requirements and gestures in place and implement it in place to ensure that the large cities are always safe and orderly. The city leaders also went to Huangpu District to inspect the social facial control and inspect the prevention and control of the epidemic and the progress of nucleic acid screening. They made a specific understanding of the completion of local conditions and comprehensive prevention and control measures to ensure that nucleic acid screening was completed on time and quality. Li Qiang pointed out that the development of nucleic acid screening is to find out the bottom number, lock risk, and cut off the spread at the fastest speed. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the grass -roots party organization's fighting fortress and the pioneering model of party members, better act on the front line of resistance, unite and lead the residents and the masses, and resolutely win the big battle of the epidemic prevention and control. Gong Zheng came to Meituan to buy Caikang Road Station. There was a bag of vegetables stacked here.

Gong Zheng is very concerned about the living security of residents in the seal and controlled area, understand the order distribution process and vegetable prices in detail, encourage enterprises to strengthen the source organizations, strengthen the distribution force, connect with the neighborhood committee and volunteers, and strengthen the self -epidemic prevention. He told the cadres in the district to protect the provision of this time an important task. It is necessary to adjust and optimize work gestures, open up the ""last mile"" to ensure that life must be sent to the house. With the comprehensive development of nucleic acid screening in Puxi, Human Village in Zhaoxiang Town, Qingpu District implemented closed management. Residents maintained interval, protecting them, and orderly nucleic acid sampling in an orderly manner. Gong Zheng looked at it and listened to the on -site organizational plan. He pointed out that the solid nucleic acid screening is related to the global resistance. It is necessary to continue to optimize on -site organizations, ensure time and time, reduce queuing time, avoid gathering conversations, and strictly prevent cross -infection. The ""easy -to -detection"" group should be included in territorial management, and the inspection should be inspected. The city leaders also came to the construction of a construction isolation and treatment point in Putuo District, and inspected the construction on the spot. Gong Zheng pointed out that it is necessary to dig up the renovation to ensure quality and safety, put it into use as soon as possible, and ensure that those with positive infections are transferred in time. After the centralized treatment point is put into operation, it is necessary to give play to the role of party members, strengthen care and care, and call on the masses to do well in self -management, enhance mutual understanding, and form a good atmosphere of ""everyone for me, I am for everyone"".

"Adult infection is transferred, who will take care of the child?","""Children's Supervisor"" and ""Children's Director"" are online",Space,"During the closing of the community, we need to strengthen care and care for special groups. How to care for the elderly and people who are in trouble for lonely widows? If the adults in the family are infected and treated, who will take care of the children of the minor? Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said that Shanghai is a city with a high degree of aging. Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, the care and service guarantee of special groups such as the elderly in the community is the top priority of our work. Recently, civil affairs departments, streets, and village commissions at all levels are also trying to do a good job of service guarantee for the special community. For elderly people who live alone, live alone, and have inconvenient actions, the community contacts the situation through telephone WeChat and other methods to understand the situation, help the elderly carry out nucleic acid test registration, and assist meals and distribution of living materials. Many ""old partner plan"" volunteers and pairing care objects pass a phone call every day to provide care and care through ""remote companion"". At the same time, for some rigid demands of the elderly in the community during the management period, such as food assistance, home care, etc., we require street towns and service agencies to do their best to provide services under the premise of strict implementation of protective measures. In addition, many districts play the dynamic information of the elderly consultant service network, timely grasp the dynamic information of groups such as elderly alone, and use the ""one -click"" information platform for the ""service for the old"" to accept the call of the elderly and their families for 24 hours. For elderly people with special requirements or difficulties, the corresponding neighborhood committees or relevant departments are coordinated and resolved. Temporary custody of children caused by the epidemic is indeed a disturbing problem. Once an adult is infected and transferred to the treatment of the epidemic, or the epidemic sealing management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them, we ask for the ""Children's Supervisor"" in the town where the children are located and the ""Children's Director"" in the village where the children are located quickly responded to Saving children's physical and mental safety as the first principle, quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. For minors suitable for home, assist in determining the appropriate caregiver and arranging temporary life care measures as soon as possible. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign special personnel to take care of them to ensure that the child is in a state of effective monitoring.

At the same time, check the office and rest places for medical staff. ""Safety is the primary. Engineering safety, hospital sense prevention and control, personnel safety, including medical care, patients, and engineering construction personnel must ensure safety. Although tight time, difficulty, and heavy tasks, they must be sloppy. The plan is meticulous, and the work must be implemented. ""Chen Erzhen reminded all parties repeatedly. During dinner, Chen Erzhen accepted an exclusive interview with this reporter, and introduced the medical treatment and treatment plan of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered. Question: What is the treatment force of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered points? What is the condition of the ward that has been treated? Answer: As of now, the operation of this episode is generally stable. The Shanghai New International Expo Center was officially opened on the evening of March 31. Medical staff accepted the first batch of patients overnight. Under the guarantee of multi -party, the medical team of Shanghai Sixth and Tenth People's Hospital, which is stationed in the two venues of N4 and N5, accepted the ambulance that arrived at the isolation and treatment point. As of 19:00 on April 1, the venue was treated from various districts in Shanghai. 1500 patients in the county. Under the premise of ensuring the safety of patients, we are also convenient for patients. The medical team optimizes the treatment process and pays attention to details. Specifically, the ambulance that arrived at the treatment point did not line up, but the medical team took the initiative to welcome it. The medical team settled the patient first, and then handled the confirmation of relevant information. Therefore, patients are basically satisfactory. At the same time, we ask the medical team to create conditions as much as possible to meet the patient's life. Many people arrived in the middle of the night yesterday, and the treatment point also prepared rice cakes, bread and snacks for them. We also prepared a spiritual ""food"" for patients. Yesterday, the 3,000 Xinmin Evening News also sent it to the New International Expo Center to centrally isolate and collect points. So until now, patients are more recognized in all aspects. Next, the centralized isolation and treatment points of the Xin International Expo Center will steadily advance, and truly achieve the basic principles of ""separate"" and ""acceptance of acceptance"". Question: There are more than 15,000 design beds in the new International Expo Center. It is currently the largest centralized isolation point in Shanghai. What difficulties and challenges do this bring to management and operation? Answer: The site of the treatment point is very large, and the number of patients with a lot of treatment is also large. Here are including Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Longhua Hospital, Shuguang Hospital, Yueyang Hospital, Shanghai Lung Department Hospital, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Wu Guan Science Hospital, and Yangpu District Central Hospital. The medical team of ten hospitals entered, and the workload was very large. In the management of the hospital, first try to be perfect in hardware construction, and meet the equipment requirements, process requirements and technical requirements of the hospital sense prevention and control; Personnel and volunteers, etc., should improve their understanding of the importance of the hospital through training, and also improved the sense of the hospital. Question: In medical treatment, is there any plan? How will the infected people treat it here? Answer: In terms of medical treatment, the medical teams are strictly implemented based on the ""New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)"" published by the National Health and Health Commission. During the treatment process, we will further refine the plan to meet the needs of patients. We have prepared the plan to deal with patients with basic diseases and try to meet the individualized treatment needs of patients. Most of the new International Expo Center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points are asymptomatic infections. We will give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and let the infected people take some Chinese medicine. At the same time, patients with symptoms are treated with symptomatic treatment, such as cooling down. For those infected, we will conduct nucleic acid tests on the second and third days. Once the yin is transferred to meet the discharge standards, we will go through the discharge procedures. For those with mild and asymptomatic infections, this cycle is basically 7-10 days. Question: As the chief commander at the centralized isolation and treatment point at the New International Expo Center, what is the difference between the treatment of the treatment of the Third Hospital of Wuhan two years ago? Answer: At that time, we were ""foreign aid"", and this time it was ""internal rescue"". Omikon BA.2 mutant strain spreads fast and has strong communication, which also increases the difficulty of our control. However, whether in Wuhan or Shanghai, they are fighting against the epidemic. When I was in Wuhan, I said, ""I just changed my job"", so there is nothing different from nature. Question: Before, you were also responsible for many centralized isolation and treatment points. Have you accumulated some experience and brought this isolation point? Answer: The team I led has participated in the construction at the Temporary Concentration and Creating Points of the Gymnasium, Chongming Changxing Island, Jiahe Xinyuan, and Expo Exhibition Hall. From the earliest we have slowly accumulated experience, continuously summarized experience, and also learned from others. Overall, the new international expo center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points has the embodiment of previous experience. Of course, such a huge -scale treatment point is also very challenging to me, which has never been encountered before.

The direction of the peripheral queue is adjusted clockwise or counterclockwise according to the direction of the building. ""In the morning, the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the nucleic acid need to be on the south side of the test area. Entering the queue area in the direction of the clockwise direction can not only allow residents to walk less, but also ensure that residents do not go back all the way.

Wanli Road, sending supplies to rescue the ""comrades"" this year is the tenth year of Lin Xiaoming's hometown Jiangxi. He has become a street performer on the Shanghai certificate since 2018. Last year, he not only became one of the first 16 street performers who had been awarded by the ""Shanghai Urban Artist"", but also submitted an application for admission to the party to the organization. Facing the emergency epidemic situation this spring, after discussion, the Municipal Performance Industry Association decided to suspend the live performance of street artists from March 9.

In 2015, Hua Jun, who graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University, became the second group of street permits in Shanghai. On weekdays, he completed the mass cultural work of the Meilong Cultural Museum at the quality and volume, while turning into the prince of music, and playing Sax in Jing'an Park Plaza elegantly. ""I signed up on March 6 and joined the anti -epidemic volunteer team on Meilong to distribute food materials for residents of the community to help them do nucleic acid ..."" Hua Jun said, ""Shanghai is me. I am me My hometown, I was born here. We can't perform for everyone for the time being, and we can only make a little effort for the city through the immigrants, and I don't feel hard. ""From the registration to the present, Hua Jun has no day without a day. Going home, ""Although our volunteers sleep on the ground and sleeping bags, Shanghai's material logistics support is sufficient, and there are no problems."" Hua Jun said. The son of the first elementary school in the family went online. Line with his son, telling him to take the Internet seriously. ""The son also cheered for his father and proud of his dad. The teacher in the school asked if anyone at home participated in resistance, and the son always proudly raised his hand. ""I haven't blown Sax in a month. I want to work together after all of us. Soon, our reunion is not in the neighborhood of resistance, but on the street full of melody."" Hua Jun said. Last night, Lin Xiaoming recorded a video of this newspaper.

Space,Shanghai Tomorrow City will conduct nucleic acid detection in the city,Today the city will conduct an antigen test,"Wu Qianyu, a first-level inspector of the Municipal Health Commission, said that Shanghai is promoting a new round of nucleic acid screening. The main task is to completely eliminate risk points, cut off the spread chain, curb the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible, and realize the social dynamic Zero-Covid as soon as possible. Based on the early nucleic acid screening, it was decided to conduct an antigen test in the city today, and will conduct nucleic acid testing in the city tomorrow. This time, a total of more than 10 million people were screened in the second batch of antigen tests in Puxi region. Some detection abnormalities were found through antigen detection, and nucleic acid testing was performed as soon as possible to effectively block virus diffusion and spread. The characteristics of antigen detection are fast speed and easy operation, and citizens can complete the test at home. The Municipal Health and Health Commission reminded that everyone should strictly follow the operation instructions and operating videos when testing. If you find that your antigen detection results are positive, please report to the village neighborhood committee and wait at home as soon as possible. The staff will arrange for you to conduct nucleic acid test review. At the same time, everyone should note that the antigen self -testing of the nose swab, sampling tube, and detection card should be packed in a sealed bag. As a result, the negative disinfection should be put into the dry trash can. The medical institutions are treated in accordance with the medical waste.

World Expo Fang Cabin Hospital sent away eligible discharge in batches today,"""I have defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!""",Space,"Cabbage, discharged! Shanghai's first COVID-19 patients with mild patients and asymptomatic infected World Exhibition Center Hospital have been running for a week. From today, the qualified discharge will be sent in order here. These courtyards will be returned to the land by various districts and strictly do health management. The infected person tells that peace of mind isolation treatment Active volunteer service on March 23. The 34 -year -old Mr. Wang's family of three and his parents were notified to receive centralized isolation observations. ""I was notified abnormally during the hospital test at the hospital. At that time, my wife, 8 -month -old child, and parents and elderly people could not be released."" I don't know how it is my turn. The unit leader called him to let him relax, do not have ideological burdens, and receive treatment with peace of mind. All units in the family will find ways to solve it. Mr. Wang was relieved, and was sent to the World Expo Card on the 26th to treat the area under the jurisdiction of the medical team of Renji Hospital. Mr. Wang is a member of the Communist Party of China. He holds the idea of ""good deeper"". He said that he had to work hard to ""turn overcast"" and return to his family as soon as possible. ""The first time to sleep with so many people is definitely not used to it, but the bed, quilt, and various living items are brand new, and the environment is relatively clean. Men, don't pay attention to so much."" Here, Mr. Wang said he said he After living a nursing home -like life, three meals a day can be delivered, and you can come again if you are not enough; if you have nothing to do, video with your family, and occasionally deal with some units' work contact matters. In the square cabin, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine was fully exerted, and he also took everyone with everyone. Except for eating, he usually wore a mask, including sleeping without taking off. ""I think everyone does this, it seems to be very common, and I am not particularly uncomfortable, just get used to it."" There is a activity area in the square cabin hospital. When the sun was exposed, the pressure was gone when the mind was empty. Mr. Wang also saw an initiative of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee from the mobile phone. He said that his party was 10 years old and his body was uncomfortable. He could stand up to serve everyone. As a result, he became an active volunteer to help nurses distribute three meals and bottled water, carry materials, and coordinate the living needs of nearby personnel. ""Da Bai wants to take care of so many people in us. It is very hard. We can help us, find something to do, and the time has passed soon."" In the area where he lives, everyone is happy to serve others. Mr. Wang Laughingly, there were several late time, and they did not grab the volunteers. They could only ""enjoy"" the services of others. The biggest difficulty is that the hardware conditions are limited. The shower facilities cannot be converted here. You can only wash it with hot water. Fortunately, washing and going to the toilet are more convenient, and they do not need to be lined up. Others are also very modest. Seeing someone in the back, I always speed up and avoid others for too long. From the beginning of the tension to the later relief, Mr. Wang said that this was the first provenance of him and the virus; and the two nucleic acid detection negatives intervals 24 hours a day was his long -awaited victory. ""I defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!"" Last night, he had sorted out his personal items and will be arranged by the vehicle in the area. ""I miss it home. The first thing to go back is to take a bath."" Mr. Wang thanked the Renji Medical Team who took care of him. He said that the family members are currently nucleic acid detection negative and everything is good. Looking at it, each experience has harvested, and the special ""collective life"" is also a different experience. The chief commander tells the difficulties that we have worked together to work together in the World Expo Hospital where Mr. Wang is located. As of yesterday, more than 7,100 mild patients and asymptomatic infections were accepted. Ji Hospital, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Tongji Hospital, Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, and Shanghai Children's Medical Center. The interim party committee and temporary party branch have been established here. Zheng Junhua, chief commander of the World Cabin Hospital and Secretary of the Party Committee of Renji Hospital, told reporters that according to the characteristics of the mutant strains of Omiko, most people can transfer to the yin to go home after 7 to 10 days. Starting today, those who meet the discharge standards will be discharged in batches and districts. ""We have strictly compared one by one in accordance with national standards. It requires two negative interval time for nucleic acid to require more than 24 hours. For three consecutive days of body temperature, there is no symptoms of respiratory tract. In the end, we set the first list."" The personnel are involved in multiple districts in the city. They have completed docking and confirmed with various districts yesterday. These personnel are managed by the territory and coordinated by the territorial coordinated vehicles to take them back properly. In terms of discharge management, the Shanghai Municipal Government has established a comprehensive coordination of special classes. If the residence meets the home isolation conditions, it can carry out 7 days of health management at home; if the family's own conditions do not have it, the accommodation arrangement will be implemented by the local area. As these groups of personnel have left one after another, completing the disinfecting work, a group of new personnel will be ushered in. Zheng Junhua said that the first time to set up a square -cabin hospital infected in Shanghai for the first time, it is completely different with the scene where he took the city's first support for the Hubei medical team to Wuhan in 2020, so this time you can only improve while doing it. From the beginning, it can be improved. From the beginning The running -in period, when the improvement period, and reaching the improvement period, cannot be separated from the joint efforts of everyone. At the same time, the medical needs and life needs of more than 7,000 people are facing very large pressure. ""It is definitely better to stay at home, and it will always exist."" Zheng Junhua hopes to tell everyone that isolation is temporary. As long as everyone can cooperate with the prevention and control strategy and respond positively and optimistic, they can soon go home.

Space,"Inspiration is constantly ""resistant to episodes"" bright moves",Space,"Yesterday, our reporter from the ""New 36 Anti -Epidemic 36 Plan"" collected by the city's anti -epidemic front -line was published, which brought new ""inspiration"" to many first -tier anti -epidemic workers. They were practical tricks. Today, let's take a look at what they have. The 7th ""Artifact"" QR code ""Batch generation"" is in Dongqi Village, Lingtang Town, Qingpu District, and nearly two -thirds of the villagers are elderly people over 60 years old. They are not good at using smart devices and need staff to help enter healthy cloud nucleic acid registration information. In order to improve efficiency, the ""post -90s"" guy Li Sichun thought of a good way -he used his professional learning to write a two -dimensional code batch of appointments based on the population information table. Each person's appointment registration information only takes 40 seconds You can generate up to 100 pieces at most, which is not only efficient, but also avoids the problem that the elderly's information may be errors in the village committee staff. Using this program, only one staff member, plus three computers can operate at the same time, can generate more than 1,400 appointment codes in the village within 5 hours. At present, nearly a hundred villages in Qingpu, Jiading, Minhang, Pudong and other areas have also begun to use this program, which greatly improves the efficiency of nucleic acid screening information registration. Our reporter Yang Huan No. 8 Before the ""dark box"" was simplified, how to quickly scan the appointment of the nucleic acid detection and register the two -dimensional code before the ""dark box"" was checked by the ""dark box""? Yesterday, the reporter found in the Green Home District of Jinhui Town, Fengxian District that the nucleic acid testing team here uses a homemade ""dark box"". This ""dark box"" is a rectangular ""sunroof"" cut out of the top, and a convenient noodle box on the side is cut around. In the bright spring light, the residents stretched the mobile phone from the side of the cut, and as the volunteer scanned the terminal with the hand -scan terminal, they could be retrieved. According to the volunteers at the scene, this ""dark box"" was made a few days ago. Prior to this, they found that although most residents took screenshots in advance and registered the QR code of nucleic acid testing, when the light outside was too strong, the screen of the mobile phone was relatively dark. The QR code on the screen was not easily scanned by the terminal-- Sometimes it takes more than ten consecutive times to succeed. And such a self -made ""dark box"", the light inside is not as strong as the outside. This is much bright in the mobile phone screen in it. In order to adjust the light in the ""dark box"" to a better level, and to better check the handheld terminal screen, they also gave a ""dark box"" and a handheld terminal. They said that now they are basically accurate, fast and safe. Our reporter Luo Shuiyuan's 9th efficient bright code brush ID card as a nucleic acid. According to the proposal made by the citizens through the public adoption of the ""Special Solid in the Epidemic Prevention and Control Work"" channel, the citizens will not operate the elderly in the nucleic acid detection. The prominent problem of dilemma, Jiangpu Road Street, Yangpu District contacted a technology company to emergency research and development, and draw on the practice of brushing ID cards at the high -speed rail station to enter the station to drive. Essence ""Intelligent nuclear detection"" looks like a POS machine. As long as the elderly put the ID card, the device can intelligently recognize it, and automatically access the ""Healthy Cloud"" applet to generate a two -dimensional code for nucleic acid testing and printed. Jiangpu Road Street has piloted in several communities, which is very convenient for the elderly and has accelerated the speed of nucleic acid detection. After that, the street will continue to optimize the network stability of the device to promote this practice larger. Our reporter Sun Yun's 10th ""magic box"" emergency material faction field in the past few days, in the Pushan residential area of Jijiangxi Road Street, Jing'an District, a suitcase called ""Baibao Box"" is a bit busy: it follows The staff of the residential area ""Da Xian's skills"" came to the scene of the epidemic prevention and control again -this is the emergency of protective clothing, goggles, gloves, masks, disinfection and disinfection plants such as the deployment and requirements of the residential area according to the street deployment and requirements of the residential area. Materials, it can come in handy. It is understood that there are 7 staff members of the Pu Shan residential area, but there are 14 sets of protective suits prepared by Zhang Lei, the general branch of the residential district party -the first night of the first day of the sealing and control notification, rushed to the scene to cooperate with the seal control measures When the property company staff saw the community staff all armed, but when they had only one mask, Zhang Lei opened the trolley case and handed protective equipment to the property staff who needed to work in the building. The children of a family have a high fever and need to be sent to the hospital for treatment. The two sets of protective equipment of the ""Baibao Box"" are used again. Before 120 arrived, let the children and mothers protect them early, and they were sent to relevant hospitals for a moment. Our reporter Jiang Yuezhong's 11th anti -""leakage"" in the field of real -time form WeChat filling nucleic acid detection data can be made clear to ensure that one is not omitted? Wen Hai, a volunteer volunteer in the seaside New City Community of Shanyang Town, Jinshan District, is a teacher of the Mengshan Middle School Information Department. He summarizes the experience of previous volunteer services. He believes that the selection of this tradition will increase the work pressure of later data. Therefore, on the evening of March 29, Wen Hai used his own director to design and produce a WeChat real -time table overnight, including the community building number and room number of the community. Set the point to perform online registration. On the morning of March 30, the Eastern District of the Seaside New Town took the lead in implementing a dynamic monitoring of real -time tables. Residents find that they can open the form at home and simultaneously know the inspection progress of other corridors, which is very convenient; on -site volunteers have found that they can understand the detection status at the scene in real time to facilitate the next corridor for testing. For the volunteers of the building, this form is also very helpful, which can understand the situation of the detection site in real time, and facilitate dynamic adjustment of the scanning speed. The cadres of the neighborhood committee also believe that this real -time data can greatly improve the work efficiency of the presidential plan. The newspaper correspondent Liu Shihan Reporter Tu Yu's 12 ""Flowing Water"" combat hand -painted ""sampling process"" Tu Minhang District Maqiao Town Party Committee Qi Yuanyuan constantly explored and handed 6 sampling flowcharts, which clearly marked the sampling moving line, Each link and corresponding functions and precautions. Staff can rank according to the figure and perform their duties, so that the samples are as efficient and smooth as the ""flow line"". According to the flowchart, in terms of personnel configuration, it is usually configured with 2-3 volunteers in one station. Medical staff is only responsible for sampling links. Other codes scanning, cotton-dismantling, and samples are put into test tubes. — Relevant volunteers receive standardized training in the early stage. One process and 1 person are completed. At one time, it can save almost 2-3 seconds, one or two thousand copies a day, and the time to save is considerable. 70 medical staff can complete the sampling volume of 50,000 people in one day. According to the flowchart, the Xia Duoyuan community in Maqiao Town also created its own ""hand shape"" moving line, that is, the orderly arrangement of residents to queue in the ""arm"" in batches, and arrange volunteers to scan the code to verify it at the ""wrist"". Subsequently diverted to the ""fingers"" at the ""finger"" to complete the test before leaving, avoiding entry and exit flowing, preventing personnel agglomeration, and improving the sampling efficiency. After the closed -loop management of Judura, many young volunteers took the initiative to report to the residential village committee. They were arranged in the QR code verification area to perform mobile phone operations for residents who did not register, and scanned the code for the registered residents to ensure that 10 people in the testing team quickly turned around. Volunteers also DIY the shading carton to avoid the failure of the mobile phone to scan the mobile phone due to sunlight.

The self -media released the video said: ""The couple who was diagnosed at 1080 Haiyang Road, Pudong New District was sent to isolation. The 10 -year -old girl at home was always at home because of her negativeness. After seeing the video, send the information for ""helping Nong"". After receiving the help, the reporter contacted the girl's parents and neighborhood committees. ""The news is not real. Although both of our husband and wife are isolated, the school and the neighborhood committee have always been concerned about their children."" The emotional at home is low. ""Chen Chen is indeed alone at home."" Essence Girl Dad, Mr. Wang, told reporters that because the couple were diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, they had been collected uniformly on March 28. If they took the child to focus on the treatment point, they were worried that the child would be infected. Therefore, only the daughter was at home. Mr. Wang said: ""Because the parents are not around, and because of worrying about her infection, her daughter has really been a bit low in these days. However, the description in the video is inaccurate. A lot of it. ""The netizens who asked"" helping Nong ""also called the reporter to call the reporter. When he contacted the Douyin account on the 1st to ask about the situation, the Douyin account said solved. In order to further understand the situation every day, the reporter contacted Chen Chen's class teacher Dai. ""She is usually a well -behaved and sensible child."" Teacher Dai told reporters that since the girl's parental nucleic acid detection is abnormal, she maintains communication with her children every day. When her parents were not sent to the concentrated collection point, she and her parents were separated by two bedrooms. I followed up to understand the changes in my family every day. Starting this Monday, her parents left home. I will talk to her on WeChat every day, or ask audio calls to ask her needs and mood. Last week, her antigen self -test was positive, but she was tense. Fortunately, the result of nucleic acid review detection is negative. ""The reporter also learned from the neighborhood committee where Chen Chen's family was located that since Chen Chen's parents were sent to centralized isolation, Chenchen was included in the community's focus on the target of concern."" The 10 -year -old girl is alone at home, plus due to the entire building. They are all closed and managed, and we are also worried about her safety and worry about whether she can take care of himself. ""Teacher Tang, the person in charge of the neighborhood committee, said that on the one hand, the staff of the neighborhood committee communicated with Chenchen through WeChat every day to ask Chenchen's needs. In order to let Chen Chen and Chen Chen's parents feel at ease, a few days ago, they also contacted the professionals to come to do the home environment. ""Thank you for the neighborhood committee and the school, thanks to their care. ""Chen Chen's father, who is still in the isolation point, told the reporter on the phone. At the press conference of the 141st COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in Shanghai held yesterday, Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, emphasized that the epidemic situation emphasized that It may lead to temporary care of children. Once adults are infected and transferred, or the epidemic seal control management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them. Children's director ""responded quickly to ensure the physical and mental safety of the child as the first principle, and quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. If it is a minor suitable for home, to assist in determining the appropriate caregiver as soon as possible and arrange temporary care measures. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign a special person to take care of it to ensure that the child is in an effective monitoring state. Both parents like Chenchen COVID-19 have only one family who has been trapped away. Teacher Tang said that because Chenchen is the secret of positive patients, in the past two days, the town is also coordinating whether Chenchen can be transferred to the town to transfer to the town. There is a close -up isolation point for special personnel, and there is finally news on April 1. ""There is an isolation point for Chen Chen. If Chen Chen was unwilling to go to the isolation point, the street also applied for Dabai special care, and she could come to care and take care of her. In addition, the neighborhood committee also coordinated a doctor to adopt a nucleic acid for Chenchen to help her relieve her tension. ""However, as of the press time, Chen Chen's parents were not adapted because their daughters were not adapted to the strange environment, and they were worried that the strange Dabai special care came to the door to cause the child to be nervous.

Shanghai Police reminds: citizens shall cooperate with nucleic acid sampling detection,Uncontrolled inspection will be handled according to law,Space,"On the morning of April 1st, a scene occurred in a community in Songjiang District: According to the unified arrangement of the street, the residents organized residents to conduct nucleic acid testing. Because of the trouble of trouble, the resident Yan Mou turned a blind eye to the detection notification, but the door was closed. Essence When the staff came to the door many times, Yan came to the scene, but deliberately presented the two -dimensional code of the WeChat business card to the sampling person. When he was asked to show the healthy cloud QR code, he forcibly broke through the staff to stop the staff and returned home by himself. It seriously affects the normal development of the testing work. After receiving the alarm, the police of the Songjiang Public Security Branch rushed to the scene to deal with it, urging Yan Mou to take the investigation after completing the nucleic acid test, and recently imposed administrative penalties for it according to law. In fact, on March 27, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government issued the ""Notice on Doing a Good Affairs of the City in the City"", and carried out a new round of cut -type and grid nucleic acid screening in the city. The general public is required to support understanding and cooperation with the city's epidemic prevention and control work. In accordance with the requirements of the street community or unit of the street, the nucleic acid screening is orderly. For the test of nucleic acid testing for unified organizations without justified reasons, which hinders the prevention and control of the epidemic or cause other serious consequences, the Shanghai Public Security Organ will give public security management punishment in accordance with the relevant provisions of the People's Republic of China on Public Security Management Punishment of the People's Republic of China; if a crime constitutes a crime, in accordance with "" The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China is investigated for criminal responsibility.

Space,Very friendly neighbors,Space,"Wu Yue dusk, the ringtone sounded, and I glanced at the screen of the mobile phone, which was called by the neighbor ""Mr. Yu"". A sense of instinctual tension spreads from the heart. Mr. Yu is a good -tempered man. There is a beautiful wife and two smart and lively boys. On the day of the new home, I led my daughter to introduce myself. They politely asked us to chat in the living room. When we resigned, we added WeChat, and his net name was ""fish"". Since then, sometimes I met my children at the door of the elevator when I was sent to school in the morning, and sometimes I met under the sidewalk tree when I picked up the child from school. In fact, I rented the two -bedrooms in this urban area, and only lived on Monday to Friday. On Friday night, we returned to the home of the suburbs and drove to the past on Sunday evening. This cycle has been returning for a few months. WeChat chat dialog box is almost blank. A few days ago, primary and secondary school students in Shanghai began to study at home. There were relatively large TVs in the suburbs, which were more suitable for online classes. Before leaving, I simply packed the textbook and thought it would come back in a few days. Now, the sudden call of Mr. Yu, a neighbor, seems to indicate some accidents. ""Your home is leaking. It may be that the water pipe bursts. Come back and take a look. The water flows out of the room and flows to the public corridor."" Mr. Yu said anxiously. He asked me if I had the key, and the property could come in to help me close the faucet. Coincidentally, the spare keys of the door lock are in my parents 'house, and their parents' houses are nearby, but their communities are being managed in a closed -loop at this time, and they can't get out. ""We rush over now."" I was ready to move immediately. Mr. Yu paused at the end of the phone, ""Then you have to be prepared. Our building also announced a closed loop an hour ago. The water over there is flowing out, and it is impossible to prepare things that the whole family moves back in a few minutes. When I discussed with my husband, I decided to take a look. It was dinner time, and we couldn't care about it. We handed the children to the familiar neighbors and took a care, and they opened the accelerator to the city. Sure enough, the urban house was pulled downstairs, and the two ""big white"" guarded. On the way, I have contacted the property in the community. They have turned off the sluice outside my house, and the flowing water has been suspended. But what is the situation in the family, you can't know if you don't go in. I took a deep breath and made a video call to Mr. Yu downstairs. ""Now we can't get up, I can only ask you to enter the password to enter the door."" I know that this has added a lot of trouble to others, but Mr. Yu agreed that the two boys and his wife also appeared. Everyone was a little excited. Essence We are like a live broadcast of 20 meters across the vertical distance. We must push away the door of the mysterious shipwreck and look at the ""underwater"" world. ""Okay, now I opened the door,"" Mr. Yu said, while slowly pushing away our door, my mind turned out to the table and chairs that drifted out of the water and took my breath. ""Fortunately, there is no water in the living room, there is only the kitchen. You see, there is a deep knuckle."" Mr. Yu stepped in and found the culprit in the sound -then the dishwasher's leader into the water pipe. The faucet should be aging. At a certain time this afternoon, it bounced directly, and the fountain was generally freely waved. Until now, it is still surrounded by water after the sluice is closed. The crisis is temporarily lifted. As for the drainage and cleaning of the water, we can only wait until we will deal with it. This is a blessing in unfortunate, much smaller than the loss I expected. Mr. Yu didn't hang up. After he looked at it, he said, ""Let's help you clean it up, don't worry."" He and his wife spent an hour, using various tools to clean up all the areas of water. No matter how much thanks I say, it is not enough to express this movement, guilt and warmth. One week later, I was unblocked. I returned home and stood on the clean and dry floor tiles, feeling touched. I knocked on the neighbor's door again, ""I'm sorry, I haven't asked the surname?"" The old saying, ""Far relatives are not as good as neighbors"", this is really the case. In this very important period, the friendship of friends is also unusual. This time, we will help us take care of our children, help us call the police and clean, and help us pick up the courier, all of which are neighbors. Neighbor. Give people roses, and have a fragrance of hands.

Space,"This battle, no you can't do it!",Space,"In the early morning of Pan Gaofeng, when the first ray of sunlight illuminated Shanghai, a round of nucleic acid detection covering 25 million people in the city was officially opened. The scale is unprecedented and unprecedented. These days, many people do nucleic acid numbness, and may not understand the meaning behind it. This is the beginning of the overall attack, the horn of decisive battle! At this moment, the people of the city must hear the order and charge in the same direction in order to get angry and win this big battle and tough battle. Yesterday, there was a news that made people sad. A community property manager named Jian Jian in Songjiang District stopped the cardiac arrest on the front line of resistance. After being sent to the hospital for rescue, it would never leave. Behind this is a moving fact: the outbreak of Shanghai has been outbreak for more than a month, and countless medical staff and grass -roots workers like Ji Jian have been fighting all over the world. Their pressure and fatigue are close to the limit they can withstand. Not only are the front -line staff, many Shanghai people are also exhausted. We have gone through the panic of grabbing food, the difficulties of seeing a doctor, the distress of being banned at home, the hard work and grievances of being a volunteer ... Everyone is not easy, and they all make the overall situation of resistance to the situation of resistance. I contributed to my own contribution. Because we have paid such a price, we must cherish it, we must continue to refuel, and continue to persist. If we rushed forward for ninety -nine steps, but took a step back at a critical moment, so that all the front achievements were abandoned, we could not forgive ourselves, and we could not bear serious consequences. Recently, many people have been exposed to their own gift packages in the circle of friends. They are very happy and happy. Some people are even exploring the cooking method of the dishes. This is a positive signal: the supply of materials is slowly perfecting and gradually keeping up. Behind this is Shanghai's own efforts and support from the people of the country. Yesterday, someone posted a video on Douyin, and the text said: ""Tears have fallen."" That was the long -run bus team, with a long bus team, with the cricket BGM ( Background music) is so exciting. That's the medical team that reinforced Shanghai! When the epidemic of Wuhan broke out, Shanghai was the first retrograde. Today, Shanghai is difficult, and the same support! They come from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Jiangxi, Tianjin, Hainan and other provinces. From yesterday to today, they arrived in Shanghai and quickly invested in nucleic acid testing and medical treatment. There are also Shanghai's cabin hospitals, isolation points, and designated hospitals, which are continuously increased and equipped every day to ensure that confirmation and asymptomatic cases should be received. All of this shows that the situation is facing. With our own hard work, with the support of the people of the whole country, the moment of decisive battle finally arrives! Today's city nucleic acid testing is the total attack gun. The strong infection and high concealment of Omircong's mutant strain determines at this moment that there must be a thorough full -time nucleic acid screening to find out the number of epidemics and provide data support for the next ""play method"" to support the data support. Essence The war is intelligence, and the numbers must be accurate to have reference value. This requires each of us to do our best. During this time, many people have some conflicts with nucleic acid detection. On the one hand, I was worried about being infected in the test and had fear; on the other hand, I tested so many times, a little bit of fighting emotions. These can be understood. Because of this, we must be more prepared. Medical staff and community cadres and volunteers must think more. The best and the safest processes are designed. They must sweep the building and knock on the door, look for people to ensure that there is no omissions and one. Protect, wear a mask, prepare a healthy cloud registration code, keep two meters spacing, finish quickly, go home quickly, and continue to ""not leave home"". Yesterday, a netizen proposed: After doing a good job of wearing a mask today, I would like to say thank you for the medical staff. I especially thank the medical staff in foreign aid in Shanghai. ""Please look at each other's eyes and say thank you!"" This is a very good initiative. But the real gratitude is actually full preparation and high coordination. This is the quality and tone of Shanghai people, and it is the best repayment of medical staff. Over the past month, all Shanghai people have experienced a lot and paid a lot. Those sweat and tears have become an unforgettable city memory. Some things are not persistence because of success, but because of persistence. To overcome the epidemic and hug as usual, it is the wish of everyone. Unite, keep it again! After many years, when we think of this moment, we will be proud of ourselves.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-04/2.htm,4/4/22,No. 2 Edition: Want to hear,

At 5:30 in the morning, in the small town of the 101 community builders, volunteers wearing protective clothing organized workers in batches to the designated area. The workers wore a mask and kept a two -meter interval in an orderly manner. In order to ensure that the team does not gather, smooth and orderly, the East China Company of the Second China Construction Bureau sent a volunteer team of more than 50 people to reasonably arrange and clarify the volunteer work points. The volunteer team is composed of project managers, technical managers and other staff, coordinating the order at the scene, greatly enriching the power of nucleic acid testing staff. ""In order to prevent some construction workers from using the mobile phone to find the QR code, some workers can not have a QR code when the mobile phone is old.

Let's register your ID card first ..."" This morning, this morning, Knowing that there is a pair of elderly people who cannot go downstairs for nucleic acid detection on the 548 Bohe World Expo Garden in Sida Road. Essence According to the person in charge of this nucleic acid detection emergency sampling team, in the morning, it was ""on -site service"" for citizens with difficulties in the area under the jurisdiction. The old man living in the Expo Garden Community, the man is 88 years old, and the stroke has caused paralysis to bed. His wife is 85 years old. He has Parkinson's disease and is inconvenient to move.

According to the relevant person in charge of the street, the ""Rainbow"" emergency sampling team carried out accurate assistance to difficult groups in accordance with the people -oriented principles, such as providing special on -site testing for elderly people who cannot go downstairs and inconvenient actions to do medical needs for medical needs. Patients provide medical docking services to better meet the needs of difficult groups. The reporter learned that there are many similar emergency sampling teams in Hongkou District. Guangzhong Road Street and Jiangwan Town Street have established small teams composed of young medical personnel and community volunteers. They are generally composed of 3 personnel. They ride ""little donkey"" or shared bicycles to come to the required point on -site service. It not only eased the pressure of medical staff, but also laid a solid foundation for the new round of nucleic acid screening work in Hongkou District, ensuring that everyone should inspect all the inspection and do not fall off one person. Our reporter Yuan Wei's century -old old city compartment promoted ""a group of 30 people, which is 2 meters apart from north to south. There are nearly 1,800 residents in the Xicheng neighborhood committee. In Xichengli, Wang Lili, who was in danger, stood on the spot to dispatch at the mouth of Nongtang. At 6 am this morning, Shanghai Xintiandi was not far from the CCP's major conference site. The residents of Xichengli walked out of the hundred -year -old litter in turn and conducted nucleic acid testing in an orderly manner in the community garden ""Dream Chasing Garden"". In the very time, a nucleic acid testing of a century -old Nongtang is the epitome of Shanghai grass -roots control resistance fighting combat effectiveness. Since March, the Xicheng community has entered a state of sealing. A few days ago, the social workers of the neighborhood committee were ""collective isolation"". At this time, Wang Lili, the ""old secretary"" of the Xicheng neighborhood committee who has been transferred to the street for three years, was ordered to lead the four social workers to support Xicheng. For a century, the old people generally do not use smartphones, and they will not be healthy and registering healthy cloud -nucleic acid. What should I do? There is a way. In contrast to the latest household registration information, temporary social workers and community volunteers check the information of the elderly one by one, and make a healthy cloud registration. The QR code is printed on A4 paper one by one. There are many elderly people who do not need smartphones over 70 years old. Essence On April 3rd, the antigen detection kit was distributed from house to house, and the ""A4 paper two -dimensional code"" was handed over to the elderly.

At 6 o'clock in the morning, in the Fair Village Committee of Hengsha Township, the villagers began to be notified to check the nucleic acid examination in accordance with the number of family or production teams. The scene was drawn with a 2 -meter line, and the villagers quietly lined up to detect the scene in an orderly manner. Because considering that the residential houses in rural areas are relatively scattered, it is inconvenient to make villagers with inconvenient moves doing nucleic acids early in the morning. Therefore, the village committee organized party members' volunteer service teams to pick up some villagers for nucleic acid testing. As a result, a small three -wheeled, private car, the elderly, pregnant women, etc. received the nucleic acid detection point. If the elderly were inconvenient to get out of the car, they asked them to sit on the car to complete the sample. For the elderly and patients who are not in bed and are not convenient to go out, the staff will come to the door for testing. As of 8:30 in the morning, 860 villagers in the village have completed nucleic acid testing. The reporter learned from Hengsha Township that starting at 5:30 am this morning, 25 villages in Hengsha Township set up 24 points in the village committee. The inspection personnel use the production team as the unit to test in batches, and adopt a 20: 1 mixing method to arrange the family and neighbors together. If the detection is abnormal, this method can be used to reduce the scope of the detection at the fastest speed. At the nucleic acid detection site, a 2 -meter queuing line and small speakers were set up to guide the villagers in an orderly test and reminded them to go home immediately after completing the test. There is only one import and export between the villages and the volunteers for 24 hours to ensure that the nucleic acid testing process is safe and orderly. It is expected that the test of nucleic acid testing in the township will be completed.

Space,The city samples a total of 25.665 million people,"Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control situation is extremely severe, please citizen friends to continue to cooperate with ""not leaving the house""","At 10 am this morning, the 144th COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference was held in Shanghai. Gu Honghui, deputy secretary-general of the municipal government, director of the office of the municipal epidemic prevention and control work group, Wu Qianyu, first-level inspector of the Municipal Health Commission, Shuguang Hospital Fang Min, the director of the Dean and the head of the Chinese Medicine Epidemic Prevention Base, attended the relevant situation. The city carried out rolling screening in society. Yesterday, the number of new positive infections exceeded 10,000 cases for the first time, with a total of 13,354 cases. Since March, this wave of epidemic has reported more than 73,000 positive infections. Omikon's mutant strain spreads quickly and has a strong hiddenness. At present, the Shanghai epidemic is still running at a high level, and the situation is extremely severe. In order to curb the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible and ensure the safety and physical health of the people, Shanghai launched the city's nucleic acid screening on April 4. Testing in a large city with a population of more than 25 million people is tight, heavy, and difficult, which is a test of the comprehensive capabilities of the city in Shanghai. With the strong support of the central and brothers and cities, the city's maximum daily nucleic acid detection capacity has reached 4 million pipes. A total of about 20,000 sampling points have been set up in the city, and about 50,000 sampling personnel have been organized. With the active cooperation of the general public, the city's nucleic acid sample work is generally smooth and orderly. As of 8 o'clock on April 5, the city sampled a total of 2.5665 million people and 2.427 million pipes. The detection of 1.925 million pipes was completed. The remaining samples were still being tested. Gu Honghui said that we have strengthened the connection of various links of mining, transportation, inspection, reporting, and nuclear nuclear, compressed sample transportation time, ensuring the full load operation of the detection capacity, improving the efficiency of results reporting, speeding up the positive review speed of the initial inspection , Express inspection, express report, fast core. During the large -scale sampling period, many of us have adopted multiple mixed sampling methods; for samples with abnormal detection results, we also need to check the single -handed single -handling for personnel in the sample. We are conducting re -examination and re -inspection of relevant personnel involved in the unusual results of mixed pipes. After the re -inspection is completed, accelerate the transfer of transfer isolation as the most urgent task. Once a new positive infection is discovered, it must be transferred immediately, the Japanese and the sun meets, and the acceptance is acceptable. In accordance with the national ninth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, we will do their best to treat those infected and strengthen the cure for classification. At present, Shanghai actively raises bed and isolation of beds and isolation. It has expanded a number of designated cities at the municipal level. The total number of squares and beds is about 47,700 pieces of new square hospitals, and 30,000 beds are about to be put into use. At the same time, each district actively digs potential increases, and selects hotels, stadiums, exhibition centers, training centers and other places that meet the patients with epidemic prevention conditions, and establish 62 temporary transfer management points. In order to ensure the basic living needs of the citizens, Shanghai has set up special classes for living materials to ensure the emergency supply mechanism of vegetable emergency insurance, strengthen the docking of foreign goods in the city, implement direct vegetables and distribution of vegetables.

Space,"Battle and epidemic test room, holding everything is everything",space,"Wu Jian is destined to be a special Qingming. Due to the need for epidemic prevention, the Shanghai people stopped the pace of the tomb. At this moment, in my circle of friends, there are many posts that pin their mourning, but the tone is not depressed. It has the four words from Du Mu's ""Qingming"" ""Qingming season, pedestrian break soul; where the restaurant is? Refers to Xinghua Village"", refers to Let you make a bit of it; there are still many people who repost Su Shi's phrase ""the taste of the world is clear"", and I hope you will keep your heart at ""stopping"" in normal life. But what really touched me was Tao Zhu's phrase ""Qingming clear, the flowers of the flower walls north and south. Looking at Lingnan Spring earlier, the shade blows through the Mo Mo"", the mood is high, showing vitality. Traditional festivals are the accumulation of the history of a country. As an important component of the traditional culture of the nation, Qingming has been set by the state as a legal holiday in 2008 to form a ""little golden week"", so that people who run all year round can easily meet with their ancestors and respect their ancestors. A bite of fragrance, presenting a bouquet of flowers, to show gratitude and thinking, can also gather together, reflect the traditional connotations of spiritual ancestors, filial piety, harmony, and inheritance. However, any traditional collision, blending, and even reconciliation with the real fields will conform to social development and public interests in ""Li"" and ""Break"". Before 2020, the earliest hospital in China appeared in the Western Han Dynasty. Objectively, human experience in health and disease has always been affected by its own cultural environment. Anthropologist Dimmond pointed out that infectious diseases are closely related to human lifestyle. Modern urbanization and high population density have put forward higher requirements for public health and personal lifestyles, just like the COVID-19 epidemic that lasted more than two years, "" The protection measures of three -piece sets and five are gradually becoming a popular habit, which reflects the standards and mutual respect required in contemporary urban life. In the past two years, countless Shanghai people have accepted the suggestion of ""screening"" when the society needs, abandon temporary freedom, and do citizens who understand, support, and self -discipline. The ancestors narrowed the ceremony of ""entering the soil"", grew the affection of ""being An"", reflected the observance of the rules, the empathy of collective interests, and the tolerance and indifference of the need to sacrifice part of the freedom and convenience. ""In ancient times, the epidemic was a cemetery, a battlefield in modern times, and a test room in the contemporary era."" This sentence condenses the change of human and epidemic. The severe problem in front of everyone. At this moment, more than 10,000 medical players in Shanghai have been assisted from many places across the country, and how many of them have turned their thoughts on the deceased and turned into the boldness of the wind and the same robe. There is also a foreign friend who ""shown"" with Chinese colleagues in Shanghai with a clever answer: Oriental Qingming Festival and Western Easter holidays are closely linked. ""Both culture is full of bitterness. The way to commemorate the process of death, rebirth, and winter and spring recovers all things. For everyone living in Shanghai, holding up is everything -holding up, not to be a hero, just to be yourself. You are different, you can recognize it at a glance; if you can't hold it, don't talk about victory. "" Looking at the empty streets full of sunlight, looking at the relatives and friends who were at home, and stepped into such a quiet and clear, I could not completely drive away sadness and anxiety, but it was still hope for the mainstream. Looking back at the history of the history, the disease and human beings have been working together. We have defeated the old disease and have preventive measures. The new threats followed again. Never bow to the epidemic, there are traditional in our nation. Although from top to bottom, it is inevitable that there will be a moment of nervousness, but it is more condensed. Through one after another. So today, we must have the confidence of winning. Each virus's attack on cities and even the country is a test.

At present, my husband has broken the drug for more than 2 weeks, causing his insomnia every night, stomach cramps, worse, and asking for help. Citizen Gu Gu helps >>> The reporter learned that patients have been clinicing at the Pudong New District Mental Health Center on Yuanshen Road for a long time, and the medical record files are also in the hospital. ""I once wanted to let the neighborhood committee issue an access certificate, and asked the husband to ride a battery car to go to the hospital for medicine. After thinking about it, she wanted to ask the neighborhood committee to distribute the medicine on behalf of the medicine, but the cadres of the neighborhood committee are also in the home isolation, which is really incomparable. Considering that first aid resources are very tight, Ms. Gu did not call 120 for help. After the reporter knew the situation, he contacted Pudong New District Police on the evening of April 1. It didn't take long for the police officer Lin Weibin, the police station at the South Wharf Road Police Station. At 9 o'clock that night, he rushed to the community where Ms. Gu lived and took away the patient's medical insurance card. In the early morning of April 2nd, Lin Weibin rushed to the Pudong New District Mental Health Center to support the medicine.

"A reporter from the ""Family Area"" of the New Guobang Cabin Hospital met two pairs of father and son",I came down here,Space,"On the afternoon of April 3, the sun was just right. At the N1 venue of the square cabin hospital of Shanghai New International Expo Center, many people walked outdoors, or with the patients, or sitting in the sun. The ""family district"" in the museum has attracted the attention of many people and sons. The two were facing the computer screen, holding their hands flat, and quickly shaking their legs. Dad's surname was Liu. On the evening of March 30, he received an abnormal call from the nucleic acid testing of the Disease Control Center. The results of the review the next day ""sent"" him and his son to the ward responsible for the medical team of Yueyang Hospital of Xinguo Fang Card Hospital, while the mother was I went to Chongming's square cabin hospital. Mr. Liu told reporters that the night when the nuclearic acid detection was abnormal, he was a little low -fever, took medicine and drink water, and it would be fine one night. The son has jumped from beginning to end. ""I am quite satisfied with the life here."" In the interview, Mr. Liu did not forget the ""chicken baby"" -the listening to the second -year son, ""It was not a school, but I asked."" Mr. Liu has already done it. For a good plan, the daily life of the father and son referred to the alarm clock to get up on time in the morning, and the arrangement was full every day. He went to bed at about 8 pm. The father and son felt that they were eating well in the square -cabin hospital. There were milk, eggs and buns for breakfast, and rice, oil gluten, chicken chop and radish. ""There are also tofu."" The little guy added. Dad said that the mothers who came here and separated through two videos came to the conclusion of ""we are more comfortable here"". ""On the evening of the 2nd, I had a good rest with my children. It was surprising that I had prepared toothpaste, soap, and brushing cups here. These were originally taken by myself."" Sitting on the tie box brought by himself and taking the bed as a small table, the fourth -grade son is playing with iPad. Mr. Fei lives in Pudong New District. During the detection of nucleic acid detection on March 30, it appeared abnormal, and the next day was positive. ""The notice was very anxious yesterday, and we were not enough to pack our luggage."" Mr. Fei said that he pointed to not far away. ""The child's mother also lives in this museum and is within the scope of the naked eye."" Seeing the video of children and parents separated from the treatment of treatment, this was what he was most worried about. Entering the New State Bobe Hospital, this hanging heart finally let go. During the pre -inspection, ""Dabai"" will list the family alone. ""The conditions here are better than I imagined."" The only thing that made Mr. Fei anxious is that it was on Monday, what to do with the child's online class -these two days, he worked on hot spots on traffic. ""Also, I want to drink cold water. But there is only boiling water here, and put it for a while."" The little guy suddenly raised his head and said. Soon, the meal arrived. The nurses pushed the cart to start dinner. Several men came around and took the initiative to become volunteers. Outside the museum, ambulances and transshipment buses are still sending patients to this square hospital one after another.

Space,Orange Taste,Space,"Before Yue Yuehui went to Huang Yan, I could actually say that Huang Yan had no concept. But the family heard that I was going to Huangyan and blurted out. Is she going to eat oranges? Speaking of oranges, it must be a simple fruit that countless people have seen from childhood, just like apples, bananas, and pears. The same is true for me. When I was a child, there were many fruit trees in the backyard of the family. At the most prosperous, there were two lame trees, two pomegranate trees, a guava, and a peach tree. There is no orange tree -weird, I didn't seem to have seen orange trees when I was a kid. But oranges are often eaten. At that time, there were two markets near home, and there were two markets near home. One day in five days was ""street sky"" -the parents returned from the market, except to buy back the necessary fresh pork. The main master of pots and pans will buy some snacks by the way. My brother and I heard Ah Dad's bicycle chain appear at the door of the house -to reason that all bicycle chains are almost the same, but at that time, we could suddenly distinguish it -back baskets or pockets on the side of the bicycle back seat or tied pockets with pockets. , Equipped with a lot of goods, we ran up and found things that belonged to us. A orange rolled out, turned over, and found more than one, but a convenient bag. We put the whole bag of oranges, unbutton the bag, and put it under the sun. The sun shines brightly. Each orange has its own bright luster, quiet and vivid, full of beautiful sweetness. After eating oranges, the orange peel was reluctant for a while and a half. What is the use of keeping it? For us, it is not very useful, but we have made a moment of playable items -we like to fold the orange peel, the epidermis is out, squeezing it violently. The sprayed juice has a particularly mixed fragrance irritating smell. If it is on the winter night, eat oranges in the fire pond, and sometimes I can't help baking the orange petals to bake a strange smell; I can't help but be aimed at the light of the fire and squeeze it. The fire jumped, and a little, there was a warm roasting the breath of the fruit. The orange peel is really sent in handy. Grandma gathered the orange peel, spread it out in the dustpan of the bamboo, and put it under the sun. For a few days, the orange peel lost almost all water, curled up and tilted, and the color became dim. I always remember that grandma squatted in the big yard, and the two orange -skinned hands rolled these orange peels. Essence As for whether there is really soaking into a medicinal wine, I can't remember it now, let alone, I naturally have never tasted the taste of the medicinal wine -I can't help but imagine that I will add it in the bitterness and spicy wine of the wine. Is a trace of sweet? Until the last year of life, grandma still cherished the orange peel. When I went home, I took orange many times to her, peeled the oranges and handed it to her. She subconsciously torn off some white silk on the orange petals, and then stuffed the orange petals into her with only two or three teeth. In his mouth, the dry mouth moved like an old cow, squeezing out the juice in the orange petal by the tooth bed. At this time, she still did not forget to tell me to give her orange peel. I handed her the orange peel, and she held the orange peel in her hand. She couldn't hold one hand, so she used two hands, like a baby holding her life. ——Wei Grandma cherishes orange peel? She cherishes the other food and crops. For example, every time I hand it to her with the watermelon, she always wants to exhaust all the red flesh to let go. I was reluctant to appear ""greedy"" almost, and I said how many times the oranges at home, and she didn't listen. Grandma will not know that now these things are not as precious as when I was young. Many times, eating an orange is no longer a rare enjoyment, and it is no longer like a child. Grandma will not know that there are more than ten orange trees on the top of the new house on the third floor of the home. Planting in the frame of wooden boards, short ones, can make a lot of fruits every year. These oranges, unlike those fruits on the backyard tree when we were young, were missing by us all day. These oranges are forgotten, and they can keep them all the time. They have changed from green to orange, from sour and astringent to sweet, staying to the New Year, and when my brother and I go back to pick it. Just this year, neither my brother and I went home. The oranges on the top of the new house must stay longer. In September of the year just after, grandma died. Those things she cherished still stayed in this world of people, destined to stay for a long time. However, they seem to be a bit different. Thinking of a small poem written at the end of 2019, the title is called ""Orange and Peach"" (""Orange"" is the vulgar character of ""Orange"". This poem can only be established with this vulgar word). And copy it here: ""What fruits should I eat in the early winter? What to eat? What kind of landscape / come to the lights, come to us / still, be born from human long -term gaze / as the fruit of still, born in natural long -term breeding / eating an orange, eat a peach / in this early winter, in the early winter, Regardless of ""Ji Zhao"" or not / we grow into a part of nature / the body that bred in darkness / give birth to a bright thought. "" The early winter has passed, and it is spring now. I wonder if the orange trees have blossomed in the Huangyan Mantan Forest? Presumably Huangyan Honey Orange, which has been flowing and fruitful one year a year, will definitely encounter children who have been born and growing year by year, and sneak the ancient and fresh taste into their taste buds, engraved them in their years, and become independent in the future in the future.

""Moon Order Seventy -two Set Solutions"" said: ""At this time, things are clear and clear."" ""Yueyang Tower Ji"" has a paragraph, which is used to describe Qingming solar terms. Shocked, upper and lower sky, a clear hectare, sand gull's collection, brocade swimming, shore Tinglan, depressed Qingqing. ""This is the most beautiful text, and the world can no longer find the two more appropriate than"" Qingming "". The word describes the beauty of this season. With the title of Qingming, the best season to write the season is the poem: ""Peach blossom rain over the fragrance of cauliflower, the crowded poplar green powder wall. The meaning of appreciation. The author is a female poet who entered the empty door in the Qing Dynasty, with the legal name Jieshi. It can be seen how beautiful this season is. Because it is too beautiful, Qingming is most suitable for outing, hiking, and walking. Wu Weixin, a poet in the Song Dynasty, said: ""The pear blossoms are upright, and you are looking for the city for half out of the city."" The people in the city really play; Forgot to return. ""There must be something that happened to forget. It was not easy for the ancients to go to the door, so they handled the ancestral grave sweeping. There are just cold food festivals and Shangyi Festival (March 3). Slowly one more festival, so that ""Qingming"" has changed from pure solar terms to one of the most important festivals. Essence Chasing the far away at the end of the year, in the reincarnation of the year after year, all kinds of sentiments will happen in the face of the ancestors under the loess. Huang Tingjian, a poet in the Song Dynasty, said that regardless of the rich and the poor, the result was the loess: ""Who knows who knows the thousands of years, and the eyes are full of artemisia."" A snow, what is the clear and clear life "" -this"" Qingming ""is meaningful. Drinking is the best way to dispatch sentiment. After the Song Dynasty poet Gao Yingqing sacrificed, he lamented: ""There is a drunk in life, and a drop of a drop of Jiuquan."" This poem is the ultimate reason for many people to quit alcohol. Du Mu of the Tang Dynasty, Du Mu looking for wine on the road, chanting the masterpiece of Qingming: ""In the Qingming season, there were many rainy days, and pedestrians on the road wanted to break the soul. By ask the restaurant where there is, the shepherd child refers to Xinghua Village."" In contrast The attitude is the most promising: ""Yesterday, begging for a new fire, the window is divided into and the reading light."" As long as there is an immortal reading light, there is light and hope. Each solar terms are divided into three. Qingming first ""Tong Shihua"". The Congshu began to bloom. In the ancient books, there were Qingtong, Bai Tong, and Zitong. They were all Chinese tungs. They were not common French sycamores on the street. The Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin expressed his junior after the exponentially sang, and he sang: ""Tonghua Wanli Dan Mountain Road, Chuifeng Qing is clear in the old phoenix."" One year and this season, I was open from Weifang to Qingzhou. The boldness and sincerity, so I felt like ""Tonghua Blooming on the Earth of Qilu"". Secondly, the ""field mouse turned into"", and (rú) is a bird like quail. The predecessors explained that at this time, the yang was rising, and there were less negative field mice, and there were more positive quails. This was the time of all things. Three -waiting ""Rainbow See"", ""Two water clamping mirrors, double bridges falling rainbow."" Rainbow has always been the most mysterious landscape. The ancients believed that the rainbow was the product of yin and yang meeting. Using ""yin and yang"" to explain the world is the worldview and methodology formed by the ancient Chinese in that scientific stage. Qingming solar terms, three flowers believers, the first is Tonghua. The second is wheat flowers. The wheat flowers are small and white are the hope of the farming nation. The third is the willow flower, which is catkins. The inconspicuous Liuhua has always been the favorite of the poet. Li Bai ""the wind blows the Liuhua full shop incense, Wu Ji presses the wine to persuade the guests"", Su Shi ""pear blossoms light white willow deep green, catkins fly when flowers are full of flowers"", they are all famous Psalm.

After opening the door, there were 4 oranges on the ground, 2 bags of evil. It's cute, just like a certain mysterious game that a co -ghost is playing with you, or what the connector secret code ... What is this? Of course, this is sent by a good Chinese neighbor. No one said, I don’t know if it is Who sent it, at this moment, I think, ""Who"" is actually not important, including the champagne sent by a enthusiastic alcoholic just now. Recalling that when I was carrying a vegetable gift package last night, I was ""no self"". Sometimes you don't need others to know you, and you just do it, just do it. Just like launching dragons in the WeChat group, making forms, presidents of Hui, answering doubts, sharing the remaining grains, providing translation, organizational operations, etc., so much information every day, in the second time the updated dragon, who is in the process of this process, who is in this process. What I did and what I paid was quickly drowned by the screen. Our memory flash is only 2 seconds, and we can't remember everyone. Many times I do n’t know, because I do n’t know it at all. Although it is under the same roof and in the elevator, this is not important, because everyone is not for others to let others make others. Remember to do it, just want to do, should do, I can do it, just do it! What's this? This is the essence of human nature! Happy to share, pursue beauty, help TA people, and strive to create their own value, even if it is a little bit of a little bit. I believe that after this wave of epidemic passed, we must immediately change the channel quickly to start to work, work hard, and be busy to resolve various anxiety and career pressure, rather than all kinds of groups of dishes and rice oil and salt in the group ... But, I believe Many changes have taken place, whether it is itself, or about this familiar building, community, or this city. We will feel that the neighborhood is concerned, shorter parents, and mutual assistance is also a necessity of life. We will miss the thousands of information in the group every day (I hope that this situation will not happen again), but there may be an extra corridor or elevator in the elevator. Greetings and chatting instead of the boring elevator advertisements and the flashing floor button. I feel that I have always missed childhood neighborhood relationships. Through this home seal control, it seems to have found it again. Warm and mutual help, care and share, and make the door ... I believe many people will feel the same as me. Today, China needs temperature too much, and it is too warm, otherwise everyone is too tired, because we are all too hard, and the string is to be broken. The more difficult it is, the more you need to understand and warm each other, especially in such a sealing environment, the external cause of the epidemic naturally allows us to choose the road of openness and mutual assistance, pay and tolerance.

When I was stuffy, when I was proud, when I was frustrated, I preferred to go around with water. The Danshui River is the mother river of Taipei. It is converged from Dahanxi, Xindianxi and the Keelung River, and eventually merges into the Taiwan Strait. The dual image of the inland river entering the sea has made Tamkang Xi Zhao the top of the eight scenic spots of Treasure Island. Mr. Yu Youren sighed in the twilight of the Tamsui River, ""Buried me on the mountains and hoped that the mainland was; the mainland was invisible, only crying ..."" After his death, the grave was located in the Yangmingshan Mountain in Tamsui. There is a fantasy beauty in the Gulf Gulf of the Twilight. Jesus Christ at the top of the cliff opened his arms at a height of 710 meters, staring affectionately and embracing the vast sea and all beings. The Gulf Gulf Gulf was considered by the Portuguese navigator to enter Haikou, ""the river of January"", transliterated as ""Rio de Janeiro"". Paris is divided into the left and right banks. The right bank is the heavy history of Jin Ge iron horses and heroes. The left bank is always melodious and coffee fragrant. Since ancient times, it has been a gathering place for literati. So far, the traditional Parisians still believe that the left bank is the real Paris. That Jeju trip made people deeply unforgettable because of the time and place. Every day, we all three people travel around the island with local friends to enjoy the wine. Dai Lan Night sky, stars and planes are clearly visible.

The city meanders. Wenzhou, which is sandwiched between Wu Yue culture and Babu culture, always makes people feel wandering in the ancient times. The Minjiang River also saved Qingtian, a small county in the small county in the mountains of Lishui. A Hongli River passed through the city in the small town. 60 kilometers southeast to the southeast is Wenzhou with a strong commercial atmosphere. Wenzhou is the exit of Qingtian people.

It has king, carrying national ideals, and has experienced six slaughtering experiences, so it also has the sad temperament that our nation lacks. I think that compared to Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, the Yangtze River is more like the Yangtze River in the Nanjing section. In the Taizhou section, there are more softness, less troubles, and more years of quietness. The Tangjiang River water on the Yangtze River Line belongs to history in the Nanjing section, belongs to the back of the dynasty, vast sadness, and in the Taizhou section, it belongs to nostalgia. Shanghai, which has the Huangpu River and Suzhou River, is a large dock. These two rivers that have precipitated Shanghai's history, glory and garbage, and set up the waters of the magic capital, and are also the watersheds of the Shanghai people's ecological mentality. The two rivers finally converged into the East China Sea. The landscape and stories along the coast can meet the composition of epic blockbusters and urban scenery. It is the nostalgia of Shanghai people around the world.

This line and behavior basically completed his wonderfulness to Shanghai. Thinking. When emotions are low, you always want to walk around. The first choice is often the Bund, and I need water comfort. At that time, the spring was cold, and the Jiangfeng was soft and wet, and it was not small.

When the bowl mouth is thick, every time Mr. returns to his old residence, he always takes care of it, loose and water it for it, and recalls his childhood, and his heart is surging. The camphor's unyielding tall is the reason why Mr. Song Qingling loves it, and it is also the ""treasure"" that can save Mr. Water and Fire. Mr. Song Qingling suffered from hereditary urticaria. She found a recipe from a friend: split the root of the camphor into slices, cook water into soup into the bath water, which can eliminate inflammation and itching. The gentleman tried it in person and felt quite effective. Since then, she has become more precious, so that Garden Ding Hao Sheng has cultivated and allows her to grow freely.

Shangla, Tianzhu and Yinliu, this is a traditional Chinese -style flower arrangement, giving people a sense of good luck, dignified and happy. It must make the flowers bright, full and lasting.

Ask for help! Ms. Gao, the Netherlands, helps >>> Ms. Gao's old father lives in Baoan Xinyuan, 789, Shuying Road, Minhang District.

On April 6, the community distributed the second wave of materials, including rice, edible oil, vegetables, fish, etc., which can be said that the old man at this stage does not lack ""rations"". In response to the demand for medicine, the Minhang District Health Commission issued an announcement saying that residents can contact the residential village committee to register, and the volunteers are uniformly distributed for the medicine. In addition to the community's ""bottom -up guarantee"", during the interview, the reporter also found that a father who enthusiastically cared about Ms. Gao had always been concerned about Ms. Gao. Ms. Gao said that in the past few days, in a call with her father, she often heard her father mentioning a neighbor named Qin Yue. In his father's description, his neighbor Xiao Qin was ""very intimate"" and knew that he loved sweets. Xiao Qin would divide his small cakes that ""grabbed"" online. Going downstairs to do nucleic acid testing, Xiao Qin will guide him to go ""green channels"" without queuing. Before the control of Lou Dong, Xiao Qin would also listen to him ""reporting the water account"" and chat with him ... On April 6, the reporter contacted Qin Yan. It turned out that she lived in the door of Mr. Gao Lao. When it comes to helping the elderly alone, Qin Yan believes that ""nothing, this is what I can do."" She said that Mr. Gao's nucleic acid detection information is bound to her mobile phone. One day she wants to do nucleic acid, and she will knock on the door in time to remind the old man. Previously, the community carried out antigen self -test. She was afraid that the elderly did not know how to use it, so she went to teach on the spot until the elderly learned.

Space,It turns out that it can be taken like this,Space,"Talking about the photography collection of Dongxin and Shiwu, there is a sense of liberation: It turns out that the flowers can still take this way! Because I usually only take the flowers I planted without the flowers I bought, the strange flowers in his album also reminded me from time to time, and so many strange flowers are waiting for me to challenge their cultivation I go to explore their peculiar beauty. I realize that all stages of the flowers are beautiful and can be taken; the physiological organs of the plants are beautiful and can be taken. (1) The first volume of Dongxin's ""Plant Book"" was sent by a writer friend. The first impression that this photography album gives me can be described as ""shock"". The strange light (in the first volume of Dongxin and vertebrae use artificial light, that is, the light of the flash), the collection of those strange plants obliquely, not only the color of the plants, but also their texture of their texture. It appears, and each petal and every leaf are so clear. The light and shadow are intertwined, and the bright and dark changes, the bright colors and the heavy darkness are tied. The first volume was released in 2021, including Dongxin's flower art works from 2009-2012. Now ""Plants"" has been out of the fourth volume, and I bought each one. Its Chinese name is a bit dry (in Japanese is the four Chinese characters of ""Plant Book""), and the English version of the name is EncyClopaedia of Flowers. The name of the plant reference book, but in fact it is a set of artistic photography of the most dramatic flower and plant. A set of photographic sets of such a name can be out of the fourth volume, which itself shows its success. I also bought ""Floris Magnificat"", which is a collection of flower art photography from a British publishing house to Dongxin. (2) Dongxin's full name is Dongxin Kangren. He was born in Fukuoka, Japan in 1976. In middle school, he was keen on punk rock music. He also organized a rock band with his classmates and friends. His later partner, Shi Junuke, was his classmate at the time and a member of the band. After graduating from middle school, he took his band to Tokyo to develop, but he couldn't make ends meet, so he went to a flower shop next to a supermarket to work. It was there, and he found his special sensitivity to flowers and special talents for floral art. Dongxin went to Tokyo's flower wholesale market -OTA Market. This is the largest flower wholesale market in Japan and the world's second largest flower wholesale market. There are strange flowers and various flower art materials from all over the world and various climate bands, which can provide rich materials for his creations. In 2002, he opened a high -level custom flower shop in Ginza and Shi Mujie. But his thoughts were too ahead, and there were few customers from the beginning. At the beginning, the rent of Dongxinlian apartment could not afford it, and could only live in the wife's house. After that, he produced some ingenious floral installation works and behavior art works, such as his ""bottle flower"" and ""plant sculpture"" series, which started to reputation, and his career slowly stepped on track. This small text mainly talks about his flower art photography with vertebrae, and his installation works and behavior art works will not be talked about. After the career, Dongxin and Zetu started a division of labor: Dongxin was mainly responsible for making floral works, while vertebrae took them down after the work was completed. After these photos are accumulated, we have the photography books we have seen. (3) Watching the photos of those flower art works of Dongxin can feel the sensitivity of his beauty of plants. Not only are flowers, but also the colors, shapes, patterns, and textures of buds, fruits, buds, root systems, and even dead branches, and special sensitivity to the various hints they bring. An important part of artistic talents can even be said to be the foundation, isn't it sensitive? Of course, on this basis, there must be the will of expression and execution. I have seen a lot of flowers and plant photography of another Japanese photographer Araki Araki. Of course, from the perspective of photography, the subject matter and scope of Araki are much wider than Dongxin and vertebrae. But Araki is a professional photographer, not a professional floral expert. Compared with Araki's flowers and plant photography works, we can see that the latter knows the flower. The flowers shot by Araki are more commonly available flowers, but he has extremely rich creativity, supplemented his lack of understanding of the flower material. Dongxin will use special flowers and make them special combinations. He will use the general flower arrangement people to use things inside the bouquet, such as the pierced fairy ball, the furry buds of the furry, the gray -white leaves of the air pineapple, the tropical orchids with strange spots on the petals, shining shining Metal spots of tropical begonia leaves, emperor flowers native to South Africa, silver birch flowers native to Australia, fairy Lan (also known as Dragon) with swelling tongue petals, and the white exposed roots are blooming with flowers The roots of the ball, the rigidly cracked Bagura buds, and even the bergamot, pine cones, the cracked blood pomegranate, etc., and sometimes there are bonsai pine trees. All of them are hand -in -hand. In addition to the photos of the black background, Dongxin and Shichen sometimes take white backgrounds. The photos of the black background are often a flat combination of a variety of flowers (many flower art works in Dongxin are placed in a box or box, and many flowers are tightly squeezed together). The unique combination of two or three flowers, such as a dragon -youmei's tune branches, with two dark purple -red peony; a yellow -green elegant narcissus, with a hammering bud. The flower photography of Dongxin and Araki was greatly inspired by my photography. For Dongxin, all stages of flowers can be beautiful. In his works, there are flowers, blooming flowers, and withering flowers. There are beauty and ugliness; there are positive and evil; there are water tenderness and dryness; there are slippery, rough and more thorn; there are newborn, there are also deaths; there are gorgeous and even glamorous, pure white and pure black; good ones are good; there are good ones; Symbol, there are also evil hints. One characteristic of Japan is that on the one hand, various traditional arts are well preserved, but on the other hand, there are active innovations. Dongxin has greatly expanded the scope of Japanese flower roads or flower arrangement art. In this sense, Dongxin, who did not become a punk player, became a pioneer in the flower Daojie.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-09/7.htm,4/9/22,,
Space,Lai Family,Space,"Luo Yuming has many slaves in Jiafu. The slaves also have a level, and they are also divided into ""face"" and ""faceless"". The highest level is the two brothers of the Lai family. The boss is the head of Rongguo Mansion, and the second child is the head of Ning Guofu. As for the most faces, they have to count their mother Lai Yan. In the fourth thirteenth time, when the old lady Jia Jun was confession, Lai Yan could sit on a small bench, but Wang Xifeng could only stand. The book ""Dream of Red Mansions"" explains the principle of ""sitting"" and ""standing"" because of ""Jiafu customs, and the family members who have served their parents in the year are more decent than the young master."" That is to say, Lai Yan has served the master who has been long -lasting than Wang Xifeng. This should be Jia Yan or Jia Zheng. Lai Yan pointed at Jia Baoyu again, saying that the master (Jia Zheng) and the grandfather (Jia Xun) were so painful when she was a child, and she looked at it with her eyes. It can be seen that when she is old, she has a generation than Jia Yan. She is a grandmother -grade figure with Jia mother. Although the Lai family is a slave, she is quite rich. Jia's mother said faced Lai Yan as a ""rich man"". To what extent is rich? For example, it can be seen that the fifty -sixth round of Tanchun is written, and Hepero talked about the garden of everyone, ""There is no one (referring to the Grand View Garden)."" Is it small, right? But reading cannot be neglected. You think, the Grand View Garden said by Jia Yi, the Zhou Chang is three and a half miles (for nearly two kilometers based on the settlement). ""Less than half"", counting it is one -third, 120 acres of gardens, just in Beijing, that is also a rich scene! Rich and rich, wealth is expensive. The identity of this family also transformed. They were originally ""family members"", and they were slaves to the generations of Jiafu. However, due to the credit of the master, Lai Da's son Lai Shangrong was born, and the Jia family asked him to take off the identity of slaves and have a freedom. Lai Yan said that he was also a brocade, maid, servant, nanny, and hesitated since he was a child; and he also went to school with his son -in -law. This is not a slave lifestyle at all. At the age of 20, with the power of Jiafu, the Lai family spent money to buy Lai Shangrong's official title for Zhixian County. Donor, in the wealthy family, seeking identity and decentness, and mixing on the scene, for example, Jia Yue donated a little knowledge; for the Lai family, he demanded a more affordable. Therefore, it is also relied on the care of Jiafu. When Lai Shangrong was 30 years old, he changed from a false title to a real duty and became a real parent official. Sister Feng said well, ""In the old lady's courtyard, I saw that he was wearing the new official's clothes again, and he was more mighty, and he was fatter than before."" Only then. Since the Lai family is a slave to Jiafu, the accumulation of wealth is of course inseparable from Jiafu. This is like the parasites we see in the forest, the big trees are thick, the rattan and the branches and leaves are also strong, and they are full of vitality. However, this parasitic details are rarely revealed in the book, and readers can only make approximately speculation. For example, when the Grand View Garden was built, except for Jia Zheng and Jia Yi, the specific manager was the two brothers of the Lai family. Jia Zheng is stubborn and stubborn, not in the world, Jia Yi is light and smooth, the city's government is shallow, and the brothers of the Lai family are silent, but there is a lot of space. The Grand View Garden is huge, and there are many opportunities for profit. You see that Jia Yun got a difference between a monitoring tree. The leaders were two hundred and two, and only fifty -two silver to buy trees. But if it is said that the Lai family's wealth is all from the corruption of Jiafu, I am afraid that they are wrong; in fact, it is not so easy. Where is more opportunities? Jiafu has power, and there are many people who ask them. In the sixtieth time, a Guangdong official visited Rongguo, and contributed two baskets of Poria cream, and also gave it to the ""door"" basket. This is the ""benefit fee"" we are now talking about. Brother Lai is the general manager. They handle many things that Jiafu negotiate with the outside world. This is not directly from Jiafu, and there is no obvious reason to blame them. Among the slaves in Jiafu, the Lai family is undoubtedly the best development. Why do they? Qualifications? There are more qualifications, but it does not work. Just say Jiao Da, ""Following the tattoo (that is, Ning and Rong, the two national public) from the children, and the soldiers have been sold for three or four soldiers."" This qualification is no longer comparable in Jiafu; and, he ""from the dead. ""Back in the pile"" carried Taiye out "", it was very contributed. Therefore, he was very high, and looked down on the big manager, claiming to be: ""Jiao Dafa's feet are taller than your head! Who is Jiao Dafa's eyes in the eyes of 20 years?"" What about then? The second child of Lai Jia, who was qualified to do, went to work hard; if he was dissatisfied, he was nonsense and violated the master, and he could only stuff a mouthful of horses and throw it in the horse. The key to the Lai family is in a word that Lai Yan said, that is, ""know how the word"" slave ""is written!"" Divided, the benefits of bit by bit, say only ""the grace of the master"", never talk about your work, and not to say how much money you spend. This can get the favor of the Lord, and in the end, he won the transformation of the descendants. Jiao Da always remember his own credit. The word ""slave talent"" was not well written, so slaves were died. There is a subtle feature that is very interesting: Rong Guofu also has a two -headed manager Lin Zhixiao. You can often see his cleverness in the story of ""Dream of Red Mansions"", but you can't read the cleverness of Lai Da. Because of the cleverness of that Lin Zhixiao, it can only be the second manager. There is also a more interesting question. I have never seen it: Lai's people, did they originally surnamed Lai? Where does this question come from? It was ""Dream of Red Mansions"" mentioned that when the head of Ning Guofu and the second child of the Lai family, he called him ""Lai Sheng"" instead of ""Lai Sheng"". This name appears more than ten times, and it is impossible to make mistakes. Those who have read some old novels are easy to understand: this ""come"" is by no means surname. Adding auspicious eyes behind the word ""Lai"" is a commonly used title of the ancient owner to the male servant. Wang Xifeng has a servant called Lai Wang; in ""Jin Ping Mei"", the servants of Ximen Qing have Lai Wang, Lai Bao, Laijue, Laixing, and so on. This is the name of the master with the name of the servant to please himself. To put it cold, the name of the dogs in the past is also common. So, do the servants have their own surnames? Or, did they retain their original surnames when they were called ""Lai""? This is not important. The little life is insignificant in the world, and there is no need to pursue the origin of the bloodline. A Q said that he was surnamed with Master Zhao, no one believed him: ""Oh! You are also with the surname Zhao!"" Back to ""Dream of Red Mansions"", it seemed to have left a flaw here. It was called ""Lai"". Later, the head manager needed to deal with the outside world in a decent name to use the homophonic ""Lai"" as the last name. This is meaningful. But in any case, Lai Yan's grandson and Zhixian County Lai Shangrong must be Lai. When he goes to be an official, there will be words and names, what is called ""mountain people"" and the like.

In order to cut off the cunning Omikon spread chain, the control had to be prolonged. Many citizens have insufficient stocking. When the supply of supplies for a while, there was a warm current on both sides of the Huangpu River on the two sides of the Huangpu River. Mutual cooperation between neighbors of various buildings has formed a group purchase WeChat group. The enthusiastic neighbor Mao Sui recommended himself, and he was obliged to take the responsibility of purchasing for everyone. They searched online all night and helped everyone to buy urgent daily necessities. This has invented a new word, and buying food has become a ""group cuisine"".

Immediately made suggestions to Huashan Hospital, and the Lingang Group promptly feedback to quickly implement improvement measures, optimize the layout and process, so that the team members Let go of your heart. Wang Zhiyu, chief physician of Ningbo First Hospital, is a veteran who fights against the epidemic and has rich experience in severe treatment. He went to Wuhan in 2020. The team he led by the Ningbo Medical Team he led was responsible for a severe ward in the Optics Valley Hospital of Tongji Hospital affiliated to the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. At that time, in the same hospital, Huashan Hospital also established a system to take over a severe ward. This time, I came to Lingang's cabin and cooperated with Huashan Hospital.

Wang Zhiyu told reporters that in the square cabin, we must pay more attention to whether the asymptomatic and light type progress, and intervene in advance as much as possible. There are many asymptomatic infections here. The main symptoms of mildness are cough and fever. They are more confident in treatment, but they cannot relax their vigilance. Medical teams were treated with Chinese and Western medical collaborative treatment to treat symptomatic treatment of basic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Speaking of this aid in Shanghai, Wang Zhiyu said that his wife and children are very supportive. ""You go, I will help you pack your luggage with experience.""

From then on, seeing you, it seems to have become so difficult. On March 14, 2022, her daughter was ill and had a high fever of 39 ° C. Coincidentally, I didn't dare to neglect. I hurried to Xinhua Hospital with a big bag with her bag. 16:13 began to queue. I did not expect that the nucleic acid was completed by more than 21 points. Only after the nucleic acid results were released, the medicine could be distributed. After a few hours of line up, the sun and the moon were seen. The child lying in my arms was a bit cold in the tall fever. I was a little cold. I didn't hesitate to take off the down jacket on my body, and then hugged her, so I was not so cold. Looking at the patients around, they were either couple, or a family. They bought them alone, queued alone, and sat on the side of the road with a high fever with a high fever. But me, only one person, with a sick child, I have complained for the first time, complaining that you who are not home have not seen you for a few days. On March 16, 2022, 5+197, Shanghai, Yangpu District held the first 48 -hour nucleic acid detection of Jianglu Street.

It seems that the plate chickens this week have fallen. On March 23, 2022, my daughter learned to ride a bicycle for the first time. The sentence was still: When my father came back on the weekend, I could perform him! In the evening, WeChat sounded again: my wife, send me a single and change clothes, more and more people are isolated in the community, I really ... this time, I didn’t bear it again, and I lost a paragraph: Everyone is alone. The decorative pool is the same as the same role as the actor in the TV series, but it will always be divided into the protagonist and supporting role.

Why can others be blocked at home in the community, why you are afraid of being blocked at home, and you dare not go home for half a month. My daughter and I are in your eyes, what exactly is. For a long time, I just waited: Sorry, you worked hard, sorry. That night, I was crying in the bed, and I had never felt a sense of weakness to climb my whole body. At 10:20 on March 27, 2022, I finally waited for you to go home with a few bags of vegetables. I am happy like a child. My daughter pulls you for a minute and does not want to delay your performance to learn to ride a bicycle. You roll up your sleeves, get into the kitchen, and promise a long plate of chickens. You said you can eat it at noon today. I stood behind you and looked at it carefully. You were thin and lost a lot. At least there were more than a dozen pounds. The knee of the knife was moved at the end of last year. 12:00, the chicken hasn't been in the pot yet, so I heard that our community is going to be sealed again. I know what you are thinking, and hurry up to help you pack clean clothes, pack other dishes and rice just fried. Launched you: Hurry up, hurry up, otherwise there is really no one at the scene. You holding a bag, wearing a mask, standing at the door, hugging me and my daughter hard, I didn't hold back, I cried, and you blushed, and your daughter tangled you and refused to put it. I opened her hard. Hands, wave your hand to you. That's it, it's gone again. Daughter: ""Dad, dad, I'm waiting for you home! I'm waiting for you!"" The crying of the crying continued from the door to the window. On March 29, 2022, you told me: Wife, I want to build a house to help Shanghai resist the disease, and I will be very busy in the next few days. You don’t have to worry about me, tell Coco: Dad will help more people, come back, come back, and come back. The big plate of chickens made for her is more fragrant!

Space,"Weather, warms",Space,"Chu Bannong's global warming has a long time. This report can also be found on the Internet, saying that since 1981 to 1990, the average temperature throughout the earth has increased by 0.48 ° C. From my personal observation and experience perspective, the feeling of warming and rising temperatures is very obvious, and the rise seems to be a higher glance. No, this year is still in the ""Dragon's head"", the highest temperature actually ran towards ""three (30 ° C)"". At the end of March last year, Zun, a friend who lived in a small villa, sent a lot of photos on WeChat, which was the peony flower in his home. I was surprised that the peony that should be blossoming in April, and now the Luyan date is almost a month in advance! Later, there was a photo of the peony flower taken from the park. In fact, this scene that peony blooms early is not only available this year, nor is it not only peony, but many other flowers also bloom in advance. The flowering of peony requires a certain temperature support, and it takes a period of time to accumulate the temperature. Now it has bloomed early, and it is actually as much as a month. This can only indicate that the temperature in the same period is indeed much higher. There has always been such a saying in rural Shanghai: Gu Yu looked at peony in the three dynasties. Gu Yu's solar terms are behind Qingming, and the festival is on April 19-21. That is to say, the peony flowering date should be until late April. When I was in the old house, my small court had a peony in my heart. It was planted by my father in the late 1940s. It was purple -red, single petals, and after flowering, it was like a large bowl, hanging above the branches. At that time, peony was still rare, so every year, the folks on the house would come to see the peony, and even the famous doctor Zhang Yikang on Qibao Old Street also came. In fact, there are peony flowers in his family, but the variety is different. He worked at Xinzhuang Commune Health Center and was the doctor responsible for contacting our brigade. Time, of course after the rain. In the 1970s, the ""three familiar systems"" of food planting in rural areas have vigorously promoted the planting of ""three cooked systems"", that is, in the past year, ""wheat -rice"" was planted in the middle of the cooked cooked in the middle of the past, becoming ""wheat -rice -rice"". Early rice planting time should be advanced. Although the amount of planting will not be a lot, each production team will be arranged for a few acres and as many as one or twenty acres. At the end of April, early May is the early stubble early rice seedlings. How much is the temperature at that time? It is about 5 ° C. Generally, the weather is very cold, because everyone is still wearing old cloth jackets (cotton clothes, there is no down sweater at that time). Planting seedlings is the life of women, but the fields are naked. The water in the field is too cold. Essence The contradiction between seedling and coldness is highlighted and placed in front of the production captain. What do you do, what should I do? I do n’t know which production team thinks of the first way, or everyone thinks about it: let the young members of the group complete this task. Open up and get used to it. Anyway, it will resolve contradictions every year in the future. Later, there were farmland boots that could grow seedlings. Naturally, women could go to the field of seedling seedlings (earned). Of course, the young people of the group also had farmland boots, and the contradictions were completely resolved. Besides winter. When I was a kid, when I walked to the old house, I always ran to the beach to knock on the ice. When the sky is colder, the ice surface is larger and thicker. The male classmates will try it, and they can only use the toes. When you are lucky, you can take one or two steps on the ice. It won't work before, after all, the ice here is just thin ice. Now, Bo Bing is gone, and even the frost is rare. In the past, there was a word called ""Bai Nongshou"" or ""Lao Bai Nongshou"", which refers to the kind of frost with a thickness, thick crystals, and can be divided into corners. This kind of frost appeared overnight, and it would be too cold to shive. The adult said that the outside of Lela (in) the white thick frost. When I went out the next morning, it was probably the kind of frost written by Mr. Wang Guowei, ""Full Cream is full of snow"". And now? Either there is no frost for a long time, that is, there is frost, it is thin, light, faint, not formed, no corners, which is far from the ""old white thick frost"". The reason is simple: the temperature is higher than before. As for the summer, there was always a saying of ""35 ° C or above). What now? A high temperature of 35 degrees Celsius can last for ten or twenty days, and the absolute temperature of 378 degrees Celsius or even higher feet can also appear continuously. Just after half a century, the temperature changes so much, and the weather is getting hotter. What should I do? I know, I don't know, this is the thinking that environmental retains.

On the 10th, Shanghai conducted a new round of nucleic acid testing in the city. Sun Chunlan came to the municipal big data center to learn more about the time consumption and timely partition statistics of the nucleic acid testing, and required further strengthening the efficient connection and collaborative linkage of ""picking, sending, inspecting, reporting, transferring, and receiving"". Limit compression time, improve efficiency, fast out of results, timely discover risks personnel and quickly transfer to interfers. Subsequently, Sun Chunlan went to Fudan University and Tongji University to learn more about the implementation of prevention and control measures, emergency response disposal of epidemics, teaching activities, and teacher -student living security.

It is necessary to further unify the thinking, so as to be fast and expensive. The construction of the cabin hospital and isolation point has quickly advanced. It is necessary to analyze the trend of the epidemic in a timely manner, and provide a strong support for optimizing the prevention and control measures of the epidemic. According to the results of the whole round of nucleic acid testing, it is necessary to dynamically adjust the ""three districts"" settings of the seal control zone, control zone, and prevention zone to minimize the impact of the epidemic on production and life. It is necessary to do a good job of medical treatment, adhere to the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine, categorize treatment, and continue to improve the level of treatment in accordance with the principles of homogeneity and standardization, protect every life, and accumulate the experience of treatment. While quickly organizing the work of entering the hospital quickly and orderly, we must do a good job of discharged from the hospital for rehabilitation, establish a connection mechanism from hospitals, squares to communities to ensure that the people from discharged departures go home smoothly.

Space ,"If you don't shake or relax, you will definitely defeat the epidemic situation ","——Liang Wannian, the leader of the leading group of the State Health and health commission COVID-19 epidemic response work ","Yesterday afternoon, the head of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission's COVID-19 epidemic response work leading group, the executive deputy dean and professor of the School of Public Health and Health of Tsinghua University, Liang Wannian in Shanghai at the current stage of Shanghai's epidemic prevention and resistance, ""dynamic Zero -Covid's hotspots, such as the realization of the goal, the challenges faced by Shanghai, and other parties, they were interviewed by the media. Liang Wannian said that now we have effectively curbed the rapid rise of the infected person's index, but we must also deeply realize that the number of infected people in Shanghai's daily reports is still high, and the epidemic situation is still severe and complicated. We must not take it lightly. Essence Concentrated isolation is the necessary Liang Wannian to say that adherence to asymptomatic infections and mild patients with centralized isolation. This is determined by my country's overall strategy of ""external prevention input and internal prevention."" Promoting the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to find out all the infected people in the community, and then implement centralized isolation management and give corresponding treatment. In this regard, it is clear: First, Omikon's strains spread quickly. If those with non-symptoms and mild patients are isolated at home, they may cause renewal infections to their families, resulting in extensive spread and ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" Time is extended, and the goal of Zero-Covid cannot be achieved in a short time. Second, from the perspective of global epidemic situations, scientific research shows that asymptomatic infections and mild patients are also contagious. Third, at home isolation requires conditions, to ensure that the family has corresponding isolation conditions, while monitoring the development of the infected person's disease. If the elderly and other fragile persons such as their homes areolate, they may not be able to monitor and discover them in a timely manner, nor can they be treated in a timely manner. Liang Wannian emphasized that Omikon's strains are mainly spread through the respiratory tract, but many domestic and foreign studies have shown that they can also spread through direct contact. If the asymptomatic infected person and mild patients are isolated in the family, there are always risks of communication risks in the sewer, ventilation system and other facilities. Of course, some special groups such as infants and young children, the elderly, and the disabled can indeed be unable to achieve centralized isolation. In this regard, professional institutions and professionals must be judged to ensure that their home isolation has corresponding protective conditions and can achieve continuous condition tracking management. Essence Concentrated isolation is to ensure the health of the people and the safety of life. It is still necessary in the current situation. Liang Wannian said that unblocking has conditions and standards that the number of infections that Shanghai have reported for many days in a row for many days. The main reasons include: First, the city of Shanghai conducts antigen detection and nucleic acid detection. Through active response, the infected person who has not been found before was found. Second, there is a wide range of community transmission in the Shanghai epidemic. It must be discovered by active screening. Without this step, the number of infected people will increase. The number reported every day shows that the static management and screening of the whole area play a role, and it also shows that the Shanghai epidemic is now on a high -level platform area. At present, Shanghai is in the stage of ""surrounding and drying"" the epidemic. Liang Wannian said that Shanghai is currently implemented in static management. The concept of unblocking is to relieve static management in the whole region. The unblocking includes multiple levels, some are unblocking of urban surfaces, and some are unblocking in communities and streets. The unblocking conditions and situations at different levels are different. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have studied unblocking in accordance with relevant national prevention and control standards and specifications. When the community was unlocked one by one, the city surface was unblocked. Liang Wannian emphasized that unblocking has conditions and standards. To ensure that the transmission chain is cut off and no continuous dissemination, the newly discovered infected people are in the field of vision, rather than actively seeking or vision. I believe that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, under the unified command and deployment of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, through the active efforts of various industries and front lines, especially the extensive participation of ordinary people in Shanghai, the time will come soon. Liang Wannian believes that from the perspective of epidemic prevention and control, the key to solving the problems of blocking points, difficulties, and key points is to do the following aspects. First, quickly screen the source of the infection, that is, the infected person, and quickly transfer to the designated hospital for treatment. Second, find out close contact with the close contact with the accurate epidemiological survey, and quickly transfer to the corresponding isolation point. Third, firm confidence, adhere to the overall strategy of ""external prevention input, internal defense rebound"", the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", grasp the implementation of various established strategies and measures, and ensure that the responsibilities of the four parties are really landing. It is the territory, departments, units, and individuals formed a joint force to resist. Anti-epidemic is a systematic engineering risk and challenge that may occur in Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control in the future. Liang Wannian said that anti-epidemic is a systematic project and major project, which firmly moves towards the goal of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". First, in order to truly realize the ""bed and other people"", the infected people who are diagnosed and screened, whether they are squares or designated hospitals, must have enough beds to treat them to prevent ""people waiting for beds"". In the same way, those who have a comprehensive and accurate identification of close contact and close contact with the secondary contact cannot be missed. After identifying, the ""bed and others"" of the isolation point will be achieved. Secondly, the spread of Shanghai is mainly in the family, but there are many large enterprises and factories in Shanghai in Shanghai. These enterprises are required to ensure the normal operation of the city and the economic and social operation. Implementation of various prevention and control measures. Similarly, institutions such as schools, nursing homes, children's welfare homes, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions are defended as the top priority. It is necessary to strictly guard against death. We must effectively formulate various plans, and to truly implement various prevention and control measures and implement closed -loop management. Third, we must pay special attention to the prevention and control of the elderly, children, and people with basic diseases. The proportion of people over 60 years old in Shanghai is relatively high, and the absolute number is also large. In this regard, whether it is the government, the relevant departments, or the people, we must deeply recognize the urgency and formulate various methods, such as further strengthening vaccine vaccination, especially improvement The vaccine vaccination rate for the whole process, prevent infection, reduce the rate of severe illness and mortality. Effective vaccination can have more than 90%of efficiency to prevent severe illnesses and death. Fourth, people who pay attention to ensuring the normal operation of Shanghai cities, such as water and electricity maintenance guarantee personnel, courier brother, transportation industry personnel, public security police officers, medical staff, etc. It is fine, reinforcement, and reinforcement, implementing responsibilities to ensure that these people are not infected. Ensuring the medical and health needs of 25 million people are always key tasks. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have taken a series of effective measures to ensure the normal medical and health needs of the people. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that children's immune planning, maternal and child health care, etc. should be implemented in accordance with procedures and requirements. In the end, Shanghai also faces the challenge of foreign defense input. As an international metropolis, many overseas flights come in every day. The work of foreign prevention input cannot be relaxed. Always adhere to the character of the characters. Liang Wannian said that Shanghai is capable of dealing with these challenges. From the perspective of experts, the people of Shanghai have always felt the high spirit of altruisticism. The quality of the Shanghai people, the understanding of prevention and control measures, and a high sense of responsibility have made people fully appreciate. Shanghai's medical and health systems and other departments, the professional level and dedication of professionalism, are also worthy of learning and praise. Shanghai's urban management capabilities, both at the urban level and at the community governance level, have good foundations and conditions. Our common enemy is the virus. We are compared with the disease of COVID-19. As long as everyone is highly unified, it will be unified into the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy.

Space,The people have confidence and strength for this matter,Space,"Pan Fengfeng tells a story that happened in our community. Yesterday evening, several volunteers were distributing foods purchased by residents. An old man embarrassed to ask him if he could be partial, because he would not buy food online, and he would not buy it. It's right. A volunteer listened, and immediately gave the old uncle the two boxes he just bought. This story is warm and sad. As the sealing control continues, these days, most of the dishes that everyone stored in the early days have been exhausted, and there are not many dishes. In addition to the lack of main non -non -staple foods, daily necessities, epidemic prevention materials, and basic medicines have also been in a hurry. The guarantee of the living materials of 25 million citizens has become the topic that everyone cares about. Especially when the light people were busy grabbing vegetables on their mobile phones and picking up dragon group buying, those elderly people who were not able to use their mobile phones were inevitable. The Shanghai epidemic is still running at a high level. In the big battle of this epidemic prevention and control, preservation of supply is not only a matter of people's livelihood, but also the core issue of resistance, because it is about confidence and the hearts of the people. In order to defeat the virus, citizens are willing to temporarily sacrifice freedom and be bored at home, but if the basic life is not guaranteed, confidence will shake, and persistence will be unsustainable. The Chinese say that the people use food as the sky. They have food in their hands and do not panic in their hearts. Confidence, self -discipline, and order are based on sufficient supplies. At present, the storage and reserves of Shanghai rice noodles, oil and meat, etc. are sufficient, and assisting supplies in various places have continued to reach. However, due to the unable to operate normally, most of the business super and vegetable farms still exist in ""difficult to buy food"" and ""difficulty in distribution"". The distribution gap of ""last mile"" and ""last 100 meters"" is very prominent. How to send sufficient living materials to millions of households? This is a must -answer question, and it is a question. At the press conference these days, the vice president of Meituan Mao Fang, Wang Wenbo, Vice President of JD.com, and Xiao Shuixian, senior vice president of Hungry, and other e -commerce leaders appeared, bringing a lot of good news. For example, Meituan has opened community sets, group meals, emergency helpers and other services; JD.com's first batch of key guarantee materials have arrived in Shanghai through JD logistics special car, including over 80,000 maternal and infant materials; Return to the post and strive to solve the bottleneck of ""last mile"", ""last 100 meters"" distribution, and so on. Shanghai has also established a list of white -supply -guaranteed white lists, and gradually unsealed the wholesale market, distribution center, e -commerce warehouse, and central kitchen that strictly implemented epidemic prevention and control measures. All districts have also announced their respective supply channels. At the same time, the courier brothers such as non -immune -related causes are allowed to be closed in the community. In this background, these days, community group purchase is becoming more and more active. ""My community, my group"" has become a hot word on the Internet. All kinds of food buying groups and group buying groups not only shorten neighborhood relationships, nourish the humanity of the city, but also enhance residents' autonomy. In the very time, the capacity is limited, and the community group purchase is indeed useful, but Shanghai still needs to build a more stable, more expected, and more inclusive supply network as soon as possible to truly stabilize people's hearts. After all, Shanghai has entered an aging society. For the elderly, online dragon group purchase may be ""another element"". They will not, and they can't learn. Even the ""head"" who are active online and offline are facing many uncertainty every day. The goods are gone, and the residents have returned orders. All kinds of accidents make people feel heartbroken. It is really difficult to ""feed"" 25 million people under the premise of epidemic prevention safety. But no matter how difficult it is, we must solve the difficulties for the people and worry about the party. Must be soberly realized that the confession is to protect victory! Government departments at all levels are incomparable. We must find ways to open up the blocking points, crack the problems, and do everything possible to complete it. Because this is what the masses are most concerned about and expect, the root of faith, the starting point of hope. Only by winning this battle can we inject more confidence and strength into the long -lasting battle of the epidemic prevention and control.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-11/4.htm,4/11/22,4th Edition: Shanghai News,
Space,"I'm in the square cabin: I have sunshine in my heart, not afraid",Space,"The bus is on the road, and there are few vehicles and pedestrians all the way. Only the lights in the houses on both sides show the anger that the city can touch. An hour later, the bus was entered the Shilong Road square cabin hospital. Since the end of March, I have not been in the gate of the community. The habit of walking in the community every night has also been canceled. As the epidemic is getting worse, there are more and more epidemic prevention tasks that have been implemented to the community. Seeing that there are not enough people in the community, I also sign up to join the service team. In the face of the disaster, the public is a city, and one more person will have more strength. I serve the front line of the anti -epidemic as many young guys and girls: I am the supplies for residents to live, and when I encounter a sealing family, I will carry it on the 6th floor; According to the call, the residents of the building are organized in an orderly manner; the antigen reagent is distributed, the statistical results are reported, and the culverts are obtained for the residents ... All this makes me feel the happiness of serving others. On April 5th, a mixed pipe test was performed, and my pipe was Yang. The next day, the antigen detection, I became the ""captain of the middle."" Later, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention came to do a single -tube test to be diagnosed. Why! I was unfortunately recruited, but fortunately, my wife who lived in a room with me was not infected. This square hospital was originally a factory area, and the large area can accommodate nearly a thousand people. Patients from all over Xuhui District came over by bus, men, women and children. The lever box and backpack are standard, bustling. The two children laughed on the open space and made trouble, which was really ""the teenager didn't know the sorrow"". A large number of crowds were poured into a large number of people at once, registering code scanning, and time -consuming time to check in. Later, the manager asked everyone to move in first, so that some elderly people avoided being affected. There are new iron shelves in the square cabin, and the pillows and bedding are also new, and the ground has been poisoned. There are enough toilets and toilets. Bathing in hot water 24 hours, people who have come early have taken a shower. The square cabin is divided into several areas. Unlike the previous hospitals, it is divided into the ward with numbers, but is named after flowers, such as mountain tea, magnolia, etc. I am in the peony area. Compared with those cold Arabic numerals, flowers make people feel warm and hopeful. Serve medical staff from Shandong from Shandong. The ""big white"" listened patiently about the patient's questions and answered them carefully without impatient. The problems that can be solved are solved on the spot. Although I can't see the face behind the mask, I believe it must be a respectable angel -like face. I heard many people around them praised Dr. Shandong! When I learned that I was infected with COVID-19, some people asked me: ""Are you scared?"" Although my answer is not so powerful, but from the inner true confession: ""Don't be afraid."" After writing this short article, it is already a night and night. Time. The square cabin is brightly lit, and some people enter the dream hometown. I hope that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, and the new day will bring us new good news. Dai Cunliang",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-11/5.htm,4/11/22,5th edition: Shanghai News,

Space,"""Foreign Aid"" Monov",Space,"Dai Min these days, his own community sometimes seal due to the epidemic. Suddenly, everyone heard a thick and loud voice from the horn downstairs: ""Residents, now start doing nucleic acid detection, please bring your mobile phone, go downstairs in order, wait in line to check!"" Oh, again, he, he, he, he A video with a protective service, hand -held electric speaker, next to the building, and the number of hobbing numbers was ""crazy"" in the WeChat group of the community. At first, everyone didn't know where the foreigners were sacred? In the neighborhood committee, he recommended himself: ""Do you know the foreign aid of Shanghai Shenhua Football Team? I am his cousin, from Syria, called Monav."" Monav is a realist volunteer. No one goes to go. Mobilize him. At that time, a building adjacent to a building was closed because of the closure of the epidemic. The neighborhood committee was on the bottom floor of the Monav's own building. He saw that the people inside were nervous and busy. The people inside were so busy that they saw strangers without saying a lot, and pushed him out. ""I live in the community and is a foreigner studying medicine. Signing up as a volunteer, I want to pay for it!"" Zhang Yan, the secretary of the neighborhood committee, is anxious for the sealing building. Listening to Monov Speaking of Cao Cao, Cao Cao arrived, and now the building is really missing a volunteer who knows medicine! Thousands of households in the community need to do full -time nucleic acid testing. Monov suggested that he was in the building and tested one by one to avoid panic and crowded. Monav took the horn and which building was the shed, and he shouted. The residents of the building performed a nucleic acid examination at the door of the house. His slow and low voice was more exciting. From morning to night, Monov followed the cadres of the neighborhood committee. Where he needed him, where he appeared, he didn't see him for a while. Why is the neighborhood committee wondering, is Monov staying in China idle? Monov's eyes were swept out of ""signs"": ""I am studying doctoral students at Donghua University. Isn't it just a internship class?"" Secretary Zhang Yan couldn't help praising: ""Monov, you are smart and and and and Diligence! ""Someone talked to me about such a foreigner volunteer in the community. I was moved curious and wanted to interview him. Secretary Zhang Yan arranged for us to meet. Saying to be met, in fact, I saw each other's eyes, and Monav's big eyebrows hung a big mask, so that I couldn't see the real face of Monav. Under the epidemic, people wear masks, and everyone's face is freehand. The mask seems to be leaving white in the painting. Instead, you think that the person is more imaginative. Monav just gave me this impression. Monov told me that he was from Syrian Damascus and came to study in China in 2007. In 2010, he became a volunteer of the Shanghai World Expo. He has been a volunteer for more than ten years on various occasions. Monov's father is a writer who loves and studies Chinese culture. Monov gave me a ""China and Silk Road"" written by his father. When he talked about his father's advice that his father gave him when he came to China: China is a country that is good at the world. You must learn Chinese culture and be a good person. Essence According to his research, good people are divided into three in China. People are good at good, choosing good but solidity is a gentleman. Monov, if you want to be a good person, you must do a lot of kindness, at least you can become an ordinary person. My father hopes that you will be a gentleman in China. Monav couldn't forget the entrustment of his father's focus, heavier academic, enthusiastic about public welfare activities, helping others, and paying attention to learning to be good. Once, I drank and chat with friends in the Fuxing Park Bar, and she had a snoring person, and a person shook in front of him. The man smiled at them and kissed them. Monov felt abnormal. He loves football, and the sports make him natural clever. When he turned around, he suddenly found that someone behind him walked away with a bag of leather in the chair. Monov flew up and chased it towards the thief. Holding the thief's body, the other hand hit 110 alarms. The police eventually caught the thief, and Monav helped to find the friend who had already left the scene in the drum. Syria caused war and turmoil, and many children were invincible in the war. In the face of those children with lack of physical limbs, Monov shed tears. He took the initiative to serve as a project manager of a special foundation and funded donations. In 2020, Monov participated in the activities organized by many institutions such as the Le Charity Disabled Children Foundation and the Syrian Disabled Children Association in Shanghai Hong Kong Square. The Syrian ambassador to China attended. At present, the foundation has installed prosthetic limbs for 15 disabled children. Monav showed me a video of the children who was rescued. He said that he believed that in the near future, his foundation would allow more injured children to be rescued. I asked Monov, what motivation for you to persist for volunteers for more than ten years? Monov smiled mysteriously at me: ""I am studying medicine. I have a study. From a biological perspective, one person can do more good deeds and learn to be a good person, and you can favor his cells. You can activate his own immunity. If people are healthy, the premise is to be good at people and good deeds! ""Monav was full of confidence in winning the last victory of Shanghai's anti -epidemic. He said that he likes football.

Space,"The ""Vegetable Basket""",Space,"These days, the people in Shanghai are fighting. Since yesterday, the first batch of ""three districts"" divided the regional announcement of control and control, and it has been released -the sealing control area, management control area, and prevention area. No matter which area you belong to, the battle is still not over. The soldiers and horses have not moved, and the grain is first. Your ""vegetable basket"", right? Indeed, many friends have encountered a temporary ""vegetable basket"" problem. If there are difficulties, solve the problem. As a result, the unprecedented scale of ""group purchase"" and the ""full star"" tent supermarket, the maximum is basically guaranteed to meet the ""vegetable basket"" just needed in the very period. Since April, from Pudong to Puxi, in the group group of community buildings in large and small, if you want to take stock of ""most attention"", nucleic acid and antigen ranked first; the second ranks, I am afraid that the ""community group purchase"" is Looking around, picking up the dragon, scanning the code, one after another. The ""head of the group"" is mostly residents who live in the same community. They are very enthusiastic. They are ""vegetable baskets"" in the very period. For a while, the ""group group"" also seemed to have become a conditional reflection. When you see the code, he scanned it. When you see the ""group"", it is unusual to join a dozen ""groups"". The successful group is easy to get in the goods. How about the efficiency of the goods is really hard to say. The day I arrived, which made people grateful; there was three more arrival in the middle of the night. ""Passionate"" problem, spontaneous grouping is a way. However, the actual situation of the supplier, the ""head of the group"" can not be the same, whether the supply is sufficient, and whether the channels are unblocked are often unknown. In a very time, it is important to allow the ""vegetable basket"" to receive the ""Xinxin Pill"". Anti -epidemic is to fight, and there is food in your hands without panic. One of the important responsibilities of the government's resistance and organizing concentric resistance is to always adhere to the preparation of the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to ensure the preparation and deployment of life materials to ensure that residents can buy, obtain, afford, and constantly files. How to do it? Conservation, stages, regions, and categories. On the one hand, insist on increasing online channels, large supermarkets and various vegetable market stocks, enhance distribution capabilities, and strive to ensure supply on the surface; on the other hand, focusing on special groups such as the elderly in the control areas, and actively exclude the demand. Do a good job of flexible supply, adhere to the full coverage of not leaking one household, and make every effort to ensure the supply of living materials for residents. However, whether it is ""face"" or ""point"", different in the past, this round of resistance, Shencheng's ""vegetable basket"" guaranteed, the biggest problem is ""last 100 meters"" - ""Express Brother"" who sends things. As a result, ""My head of me, my regiment"", the army suddenly protruded. An interesting phenomenon is that the public account of many community streets has recently received unprecedented attention from residents in the jurisdiction. Because there are heavy releases on the public account -the latest group procurement channels, come! Different from the spontaneous residents, the supply channels for group purchase are mostly endorsed by government credit; the ""head of the regiment"" is also assigned by the neighborhood committee, the industry committee or the property selection; Procurement, the quality of goods, and delivery efficiency, so that the cost -effectiveness and stability of the ""vegetable basket"" in the very period are guaranteed. At the same time, some tent supermarkets driving at the gate of the community also solve the urgent need to protect the eyebrows. At present, Nanqiao Town has opened 45 tent supermarkets, covering 135 communities in the global area. Other streets and towns are planned to open a thousand stores, which seems to be ""full of stars"". The road to confession. "" In March and April 2022, COVID-19 killed the carbine, and the 25 million people in Shencheng put it into the battle. If it is said that the whole population resists, it is a large puzzle, and the word ""victory"" is spent. Anti -disease was originally a great competition for grassroots governance capabilities. The more where the place is planning, scientific scheduling, hard work and hard work, the residents in which place can be more ""heart pill"" and less ""panic"". Moreover, COVID-19 is not the ""last test question"" encountered in the oversized urban social governance. Finally, a photo by the way. A ""Dabai"" said that he was too tired, and he fell asleep on the ground. The photo was taken by a ""head"". The ""vegetable basket"" in the very period is not easy! Remember, only ""group"" necessities, pure water, cola, Sprite and the like, even if. Those consecutive axis ""big white"" are social workers, properties or volunteers. The overload is near the limit. Please take care of them!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-12/4.htm,4/12/22,The 4th edition: Shanghai News,
Space,"The epidemic, let us start paying attention to the people and things around us",Space,"During the control period, people who have always been busy slowly slowed their own steps and were banned from the small square inch. People began to pay attention to the people and things around them. Because of this epidemic, I also entered the WeChat group in the corridor. Because of this epidemic, the residents of our unit building formed a ""community of destiny"". There are a total of 32 households in our unit, and there are more than 90 people and young people. Before entering the group, I was except for several neighbors who were up, down, and right (these neighbors, I also met because of the decoration last year). I didn't know anyone, let alone understand each other. From the beginning of March 15th to the present, although I and many neighbors are still not familiar with each other, some have not been on the top holes so far, but I can already answer with other neighbors in the group, and even dare to follow without. The neighbors who have met the face ""inserted the scripture"". What's more interesting is that I heard in the group that a big brother who lives on the first floor of us was also the Air Force before. He actually had the same occupation with my father -aviation measurement. It's so fate! At that time, I didn't say anything, and immediately added his private WeChat, and then from the task of the Air Force Airlines Troupe to the life of the army's courtyard, a sea chat. ""Far relatives are not as good as neighbors."" Most of us used to understand its meaning in the book. Now, there are difficulties in neighbors. The warmth of followers gives everyone a deep understanding: ""703, do you have ghost dishes, right? The seafood I posted by my family will give you it, I will bring it out when I do a nucleic acid. """"@702 Auntie, hello! I'm sorry, I eat seafood allergic, I have your heart! Thank you.

There is a girl upstairs for more than a month. I didn't eat meat on the week! ""So, some neighbors helped ask for help in the group:"" That girl said in the group yesterday that she didn't eat meat a few weeks, everyone can help each other. ""Immediately, there would be neighbors answering : ""I fried chicken breasts at night, do more."" That night, the girl ate the fried chicken nuggets from the neighbors. I also added the girl's WeChat in private. She wanted to transfer her hundreds of yuan and let her buy more, but she refused to accept anything. The community distributed love dishes according to one family. There are not enough people who have the lease upstairs. They report to the leader of the building. After a while, the building leader replied: ""I just asked the Secretary of the Resident Commission Zhou just for a while. After a while, I waited for a while. The following security guards will be delivered, you can divide each other. Understand more during the special period. ""The day before yesterday, some common medicines in the hands of neighbors of chronic diseases began to be anxious. They asked for help in the group, so everyone helped to make an idea and find a way that the neighbors with medicine in their hands were even more generous. Faced with thanks, these neighbors said: ""Everyone is not easy now. It is fate to be able to live in a building."" ""Money does not need, neighbors, and help each other to help each other. . ""The veteran elder brother living on the first floor, during the period of this epidemic, was voluntarily served as a"" mobile whistle, supervisor, courier, buyer ... ""I am in the group Like him, he said to me privately: ""Everyone has left a little love every time, because I don't know which cloud color is rainy."" Yeah, for many years, we have lived in the high -rise building of reinforced concrete casting. Many people's life models, many people, including me, have lived in one place for many years, and even the neighbors' name and who are who are not clear, let alone contact. This outbreak asked everyone to retrieve the long -lost neighborhood. I think that after the epidemic, the relationship between neighbors will definitely change.

It is worth mentioning that Wuhan Union Hospital also relies on Internet hospital online diagnosis and treatment services to open an online slow disease diagnosis platform for patients in the square -cabin hospital. Because the service takes 24 hours to be online, in order to ensure the timely reply to the patient's consultation, many doctors have sacrificed their rest time while taking into account the work.

I have a rare glands -like cystic cancer (referred to as ACC), which is a type of oral cancer. Due to the number of hospitals that can treat this disease across the country, I rushed to Shanghai from Guangzhou with my family. I currently rent No. 227, Lieqiao Village, Kangqiao Town, Pudong. However, due to the epidemic control and traffic control, there are many difficulties on the road to medical treatment. Can the kind people in Shanghai help me! Mr. Zheng, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, helped >>> Mr. Zheng said that he spent a year from seeing a doctor to confirm the diagnosis. In the end, he chose to receive radiotherapy at the Ninth People's Hospital affiliated to the School of Medicine of Shanghai Jiaotong University. The radiotherapy plan of 30 times in 45 days has now been made 8 times. However, due to the recent road closure control, it is very difficult to rush from Pudong to Puxi. After receiving the help, the reporter asked Mr. Zheng to make a report to the neighborhood committee where the rental place was located, and reported to the nearest medical resources after reporting to the street town. However, his oral cancer is special, and the requirements for radiotherapy treatment are not every hospital. After knowing the situation, the reporter asked Mr. Zheng to contact the attending physician of the Ninth People's Hospital, first make an appointment for the time of consultation, and then find a way to solve the problem of closed -loop transfer. However, from April 1st to 4th, the hospital was discontinued due to holidays, and chemotherapy appointments were postponed to April 5.

""Hello, Teacher Mao, I am Zhang Jianlu, give you a reagent for antigen detection."" The voice was strong and strong, calm and loud, just like the echo of magma surging in the depths of the strata. No wonder it is unfamiliar with the male bass singer Zhang Jianlu, the male bass singer of the Shanghai Opera House. I have watched the opera ""Aida"", ""Turandot"" and ""Carmen"" starring him, especially the original opera ""Gambling Fate"". His voice is mellow, infectious and penetrating, and is a rare outstanding male bass singer in China. Occasionally I met him while walking in the community and lived in Building 15.

The river water is like a jade belt, so gentle and quietly flows under the bridge. Many photos on the Internet show us the Bund, Nanjing Road, and Baidu Bridge with no traffic without traffic ...

I raised me for a lifetime, full of endless vitality, and forever, a large city with a population of 25 million, so I was so quiet that I couldn't hear a sound and can't see a person. … History will remember this day, April 1, 2022.

The doctor who came to test was full of starlight last night and came from Liu'an in Anhui. Tonight they would rush back to Liu'an and not add a burden to the Shanghai people. After each resident completed the nuclear inspection, he gently said ""thank you!"" I saw Zhang Jianlu -like again. I talked to him at night, thank you. He said, I was very moved, our residents really cooperated. At 10 am, a doctor nurse collected by the nuclear inspection sample stood at the door of the community and ranked farewell to the residents of the community in a white protective suit.

Space,The brisk return should not have bondage,Space,"Puyang's backpack on the back and take the ""anti -epidemic certificate"". At the door of the ward, you can't wait to look out. Is the connection vehicle sent by the local area? The roar of the engine is getting closer and closer, and the door of the square cabin hospital slowly opens. ""You have worked hard, thank you!"" Thanks for the ""big white"" that accompanied for many days, you three steps and two steps, and briskly appear on The car waves out of the window, and it is some of the way here -now, the health monitoring of 7 days of healthy is successful, and your personal ""war"" will be successful. The Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission reported that yesterday, 334 cases were discharged from the city in the city, and 6,044 cases were dismissed from quarantine medicine. Since March 1, more than 20,000 people have been discharged and lifted in isolation medicine. Our hometown has been more than 20,000 new infections for many consecutive days. According to the latest research and judgment of the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism, the epidemic is still in a rapid rise. It is expected that the number of new infections in the next few days will still be at a high level. Under the haze of the epidemic, the news of the discharge seemed to try to open the light of the clouds and fog, bringing hope and confidence. At the Fang Cabin Hospital of the Urban Football Museum, after 5 days of opening, 196 patients were discharged at the standard; at the New Guopa Cabin Hospital, hundreds of patients were on the way back to return yesterday. Li Zhiqiang said that the aid medical staff, volunteers and patients for Shanghai have formed a brave and responsible group. I hope that everyone will continue to unite closely, recover the cabin as soon as possible, and return to normal life. COVID-19 patients were discharged from discharged by two consecutive nucleic acid tests. The results were negative, and the sampling time was at least 24 hours. The symptoms of the respiratory tract were significantly improved for 3 consecutive days. Generally speaking, those with mild and asymptomatic infections can obtain a ""anti -epidemic certificate"" in about 7 days through isolation medical observation and combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine at the square cabin hospital. As the operation of the square -cabin hospital is becoming more mature, the docking of patients after discharge is smoother. But there are also sounds that their regression will affect neighbors and the environment? These voices made the originally brisk return, and the pressure also added the guilt and apology that the innocent infected people were unnecessary. But in fact, many medical experts ""platforms"" for them: discharges and discharges and discharged medical observers have no impact on neighbors and the environment, and they should not be afraid or discriminated. The Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission also made three orders: the territory must be connected, allowing them to go home, not to block, and care about them, and cooperate with their home health monitoring at the same time. Yesterday, 39 ""Anti -Epidemic Warriors"" in W2 ""Parent -Chile"" of the New Guobo Bo Fang Hospital jumped out of the ward. Wang Wei, the leader of the medical team of Shanghai Children's Medical Center, said that after the patient was discharged from the hospital, the medical staff would kill the bed. In the afternoon, the patient was admitted to the hospital. ""The arrangement is very close."" Yes, in the confrontation with Omikon, we must raise speed! Only when the healing person can return, the newly discovered infected person will be treated for the first time, and the beds of the squares hospital will quickly turn around, so that ""the acceptance and the separation should be accepted"" more powerful, so that the virus can be effectively cut off. spread.

Space,Is there a bird sounding outside your window?,Space,"Do you believe? The sound is also temperature. What is the best voice in your memory? The child's first cry, the Bund's big bell, the stream of the mountains, the blending of the waves and the wind, and even the flute of the Pujiang River ... Now, for me, the best voice is to receive it in the last week. In all corners of Shanghai, more than 200 bird videos and recording. In my opinion, this is a stubborn and warm life in the daily life of Shanghai people. On April 3rd, a usual afternoon in a sealing control, I suddenly heard a long -lost bird sounding on the balcony at home, so clear and pleasant, I quickly pulled out my phone and recorded it, and then sent it to my friends and relatives around me. With the circle of friends, I got a lot of likes and feedback. Late at night that day, there was a student privately message me: ""I am isolating in the dormitory, and the birds shared by the teacher are very moved. There is nothing in Jiangnan, and I will give me a spring. Share it to the teacher, I hope you are happy every day."" I am happy. ""I I opened her recording and listened to the bird's bird's sounding. I was moved and happy, and a thought of jumping out of my head: How good everyone is here to convey the birds? So, I wrote the text to solicit recording: ""If you are willing, please use your mobile phone to record the birds he heard and share the beauty around you. Together and pass it together."" This is the sustainable sustainable promotion of the current promotion. Sexual public co -creation art ""Bird Ming Radio"", which originated from individuals and friends, developed on social media. I think this is part of ""discovering the beauty around you"" and Sharing and healing. Today, my daily work is to sort out the audio and videos, check and correct the text information of the recording data in time, and edit the audio file editing into a video. Record the author, point, and file name. The anchor is not easy. But I will insist on doing it. When it is unblocked, these materials can be made in the theater, which can be played in the shopping malls and public spaces such as office buildings and communities. This is a transmission and a record. Many people are physically and mentally exhausted because of the spread of the epidemic and negative information on the Internet. I hope that these birds will pass on a force to the city. Many enthusiastic friends in the circle of friends, including some public welfare institutions, schools, and art galleries have added this relay of love. These videos and audio reminds us that the love of this city is eternal. Inject hope, just as the birds outside the window continue to sing.

Space ,Girls with cancer are swollen like a ball and a multi -party help chemotherapy condition is slow ,Space ,"I asked my 5 -year -old daughter to be found in the late stage of liver cell tumor and had metastasized. More than a month ago, I took my daughter to the Shanghai Children's Medical Center for medical treatment. After a course of chemotherapy, the condition improved. However, due to the sealing of the hospital, her daughter had to stop chemotherapy for nearly a week. Seeing that her stomach was swollen like a basketball, I was really anxious, I really hope that someone can help my daughter! Mr. Liu, Shandong Province, helped >>> Mr. Liu told reporters that her daughter was diagnosed with liver celloma in Shandong. ""At that time, the daughter's stomach was enlarged and the mental condition was not very good. The doctor said that if this goes on, the belly may be ruptured at any time, which is life -threatening."" So, Mr. Liu took his 5 -year -old daughter on February 24 this year, Return from Shandong to Shanghai. Subsequently, the father and daughter rented a house on Linyi Road near the hospital. ""At that time, the daughter's cancer was late, and the cancer cells had metastasized to the lungs. On March 9th, the first chemotherapy began. Then we were told to be discharged and waited for the next chemotherapy."" The reporter understood it In the case, chemotherapy must be implemented in four phases. After the first chemotherapy, it was a 15 -day ""suppression period"". Mr. Liu took his daughter to rest in the rental house. In the blink of an eye, it was almost April 4th. This is the second day of chemotherapy treatment, but the hospital came from the hospital: Due to the positive cases, the ward needs to be closed for a period of time, and chemotherapy cannot be hospitalized for the time being. This made Mr. Liu anxious. They could only stay in the rental house, and their hearts were extremely torment. ""My daughter's stomach is getting bigger every day, swelling like a basketball, I dare not see it, let alone what to do ..."" Mr. Liu choked and said, the daughter was strong and never shouted pain, but instead did not shout, but did not shout pain, but did not shout pain. Instead, she never shouted.

Space,Under the ancient cypress tree,Space,"Compared with other parks, Xiao Fuxing and other parks. In the early spring of the world, there is no other flower blooming except for sporadic spring flowers. Magnolia in Zhai Palace will wait until the end of March. It can only be seen in the middle. The gray heavenly altar, at this time, relies on the ancient tree to get angry. This is indeed unable to match any other parks. For such ancient trees, there are 3562 plants in the world. If it wasn't for the chaotic erosion of artificial war and natural disasters in the long -term building of the Temple of Heaven, the number of ancient trees should be more. The most anticipated ancient tree in the heavenly altar is the cypress Huaihuai on the north side of the promenade, and the Kowloon cypress outside the echo wall. The ancient trees there, because they were too famous, were surrounded by iron railings, and people could not contact them intimately. For me, the most favorite is the three Gubai outside the West Chai Herhen Gate. For so many years, almost every time I arrived at the Temple, I will look at these three Guba, as if they are my storm; sometimes they draw them, they always paint, and they are not like. In the Temple of Heaven, there are two pieces of Chaihe Libn Gate, which are listed on both sides of the east and west sides of the wall of the palace. At the beginning, it provided firewood for sacrifice for sacrifice for sacrifice to killing and cooking cowckers. These two doors are now in the office of the Temple of Heaven. There are clean and hygienic tricycles in the door of Xichaihe Railway, which is not open to the public. Therefore, the tourists here are almost nothing. In front of the door, three Gubai, arranged from east to west, winter and summer, spring and autumn, dense branches and leaves, lush, like three mighty strong men, standing there, the lawn is like a red wall, the red wall is like blood, there is a difficulty of difficulty The vicissitudes of vicissitudes. Especially in the spring, the tender green of grass, the green of the tree, the redness of the wall, and the green of tiles, and the color is strong and vivid. I always think that the color of the heavenly altar is the best. These three thick cubes are very old. One is more than 560 years and two or more. Throughout the Temple of Heaven, it is difficult to find such a long -standing ancient tree standing side by side together. At noon at the Women's Day on the Women's Day, I passed the Gate of Huajianan from the south, walked along a slippery red wall, and walked to the corner of the wall, and I could see these three ancient trees. Suddenly, at a glance, a girl stood in front of the old cypress. She stood quietly, motionless, stood for a long time, and always looked up at the crown. I stood there, and I didn't want to disturb her. I have rarely seen tourists here, and I have never seen anyone standing there quietly and looking up at the trees. I saw the girl moved and turned around slowly, her arm stroked the cracked old trunk from time to time. That looks like the child surrounds the old man's knees, and the old tree becomes kindly kind, telling her about the past. The wind blows lightly, and the branches and leaves move. The sunlight at noon spilled on her face and body through the branches and leaves. Because she was walking around, the sun jumped from time to time, and she went smoothly for a while, and her backlighting face and body, like a butterfly flipping. Suddenly I was a little moved, for this girl, and for this ancient tree. The girl was so awesome about the ancient trees. Ancient trees are worthy of girls. However, now, many of us seem to have no feeling or lack of such awe. We are generally willing to worship the god statue, but we do not know that the trees are particularly ancient. In fact, it is also the god of nature. In front of nature, people are small. In front of the ancient trees with 5-6 hundred years, people are also small. Thinking of the ancient Roman philosopher Augustine, he was ashamed of lust and wanted to worship in front of God. He did not go to the church's cross, but fell down under a fig tree. I also think of the ancient Roman poet Ovid, the old couples of Federer and Bamkas written in his great poem ""Transformed"", hoping that he would not become something else after his death, but only turned into it, but only turned into it. The two trees in the temple, one oak tree, and a cricket tree. In that distant era, the trees are so awesome. In today's business age, trees are just a kind of commodity, or ornamental products, and are no longer a god of nature. We will no longer call the trees as Shenmu, let alone kneel down under a tree, or hope that we will become a tree after death. I saw the girl walking around in front of this Gubai and walking to the second one, and she had been walking around silently before these three Gubai. When I passed by her, I greeted her. She stood up and asked me politely. I talked with her a few briefly, knowing that she came to Beijing from Shanghai to play in Beijing during the holiday. I just wanted to ask her why she was so interested in these three ancient trees. But she asked me first: Do you know that there are still older trees in the world than these three ancient trees? I told her that there was not far away in front of the Gubai who was about to fall down but still alive, it was worth seeing. She couldn't wait to say goodbye to me. The girl is less than thirty, with good faces, ponytails, sportswear, white sports pants, red sports velvet jackets, plus a beige vest, a white baseball cap, a brown back with brown back with brown back Backpacks, the three green cypresses that are green like deep lakes, and the red wall, and the green lawn, the color is diverse, like a strange seven -color flower in full bloom. These days, the epidemic in Shanghai was serious. Suddenly, I thought of the girl.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-13/6.htm,4/13/22,The 6th edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space ,Lord Bian ,Space ,"The elderly Zhou Huacheng has a cherished attitude towards farmers. In addition to the heart, this is also awe. For example, if a flat -handed manner fell to the ground, the child was about to cross, and the adult would stop it in time and erected flat and respectfully on the corner. Children naturally do not understand why, and adults do not know, they just feel that it is a taboo. Life in the countryside often has some taboos. For example, a grain of rice falls on the ground, and the feet cannot be stepped on; for example, you cannot whistle at night; for example, you cannot use your fingers to the moon, otherwise the moon will cut people's ears; It should be picked up and stuffed into the paper basket or corner -although it is now thinking about it, many of the agreed taboos are unreasonable, and many of them are superstitious ingredients, but they actually spread. This makes the lives of village people have a lot of rituals in it, and there are many particular attention, making life very solemn. Why not let the flat burden be allowed to cross it? I later read a paper (Ding Xiaolei, Sun Jian, and Wang Siming, ""The Cultural Performance and Significance of Jiangnan River's Folk Tools Folk Heritage"", China Agricultural History 2015). There are gods, and there is a ""flat manner"" in the flat burden, also known as ""the master of flat burden"". The awe of ""Bian Dan"" is reflected in the daily usage customs. For example, in some places, if you accidentally cross the burden of others, the perpetrators will be asked to bear a risk, that is, if the burden of the shoulder should have sores on the shoulder within a month, the medical expenses and misunderstanding costs will be used. The perpetrators should be borne by the perpetrator. As a sickle, there is also a ""sickle god"". According to the old man, the sickle cannot be grinded before harvesting the rice. It must be used after use. If it is not used after being grinded, it will be grinded again, called ""grinding heavy knife"", this kind of knife is easy to hurt people. Therefore, some elderly people are particularly particular about it. After the knife is grinded, they are drawn a few times with the tip of the knife, indicating that they have been used, and then they will be used with confidence. Similarly, the rice barrels and granary are used as a tool for storing food, and they have settled in the ""valley god"". The rice barrel is the most important farm tool in farmers' homes. Recently, I read a book of rice -made culture and saw the book saying that the folks in Dongyang, Zhejiang believed that Gu Shen was not in the temple, but attached to the rice barrel. In my hometown of Luzhou, there have been many particular attention in the past, such as not too casual rice barrels. Even if it is a child, you can't put your feet on the rice barrel, otherwise you are disrespectful. The barn and rice cylinder must not sit on it. Even for the rice tube in the rice tank, you must not be placed randomly. You must treat it well. Only in this way can you ensure that the rice cylinder is not empty. The rice tube can always scoop out the rice with white flowers. Dravi God, in the vast area of rice in China, has a wide range of mass foundations -in the intangible cultural heritage project of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, there are ""Manga Festival"". Come to pray for the giving harvest of the King of Rice. In ancient times, King Zongya was the rice god. June of the lunar calendar is the key time season for rice to pump and promote flowers. It determines whether the food can be harvested in harvest. The blessing of God. Therefore, farm tools are more symbols, even if they are a hoe, a burden, and a flat burden. They should be cherished. If farmers do not cherish their labor tools and do not love to take care of them, how can they do a good job of agriculture? It seems that I entered the news industry at the beginning of a decade ago. An old photographer said that the camera was his weapon. Even if it fell into the river once, the whole person was soaked, and the camera was still by him by him. Holding one hand high, unscathed. This is a person's highest respect for his profession. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that when my father wrote on agricultural tools (commonly known as ""number""), it was so solemn. As far as I see, the simplest one is to write the owner's name on the burden, baskets, and windmills, and write more about ""some, so, and so"", and the year and month; In terms of the windmill, ""Sichuan flows endlessly"", ""remove the floating real"", the rice barrel is written ""Grapho Feng Deng"", and the barn is written on the barn, ""The Year of the Grand"" and ""Jingu Mancang"". Some scholars believe that rice -made agricultural tools have a long history and have a long history, starting in the Song Dynasty, and flourishing with the development of Jiangnan. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, it was the most prosperous and became a cultural activity agreed by the masses. In fact, I would like to say that the so -called ""cultivation of heirs"" and the so -called ""sunny and rainy reading"". Two things are reflected in a small agricultural tool. As a cultural sense, the education of farming labor, through agricultural tools, subtly pass the essence of its essence to the children in the country, and spread it from generation to generation. Today, few people will notice what else is there. Even children will not believe that there are ""gods"" in the burden, which is the progress of the times. However, sometimes the times go too fast and leave a lot of things. Stop, think about it, where do you do not understand the truth for generations. They often say, ""Three feet with gods"", where do you not know the truth -just see through without saying a break. Or, they are not respecting a specific ""god"", but a sense of ritual of life, a awe of farming life. Only in this way, only the rules of acting, and the truth of being a person.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-13/7.htm,4/13/22,Edition 7: Nightlight Cup ,

In the Q & A session, there were questions from reporters, why have a positive infection constantly appearing in the community for a long time? Wu Huanyu, deputy director of the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that there are mainly these three reasons -one is that the screening data has a certain delay. Nucleic acid screening work is very large. If there is a positive mixed pipe after inspection, it is also necessary to make a single check and review. For the detected positive personnel, the positive personnel should further conduct an epidemiological investigation and collect accurate related medical information and personal information. At the same time, you must also complete the work of the report. Second, there are family aggregate communication. The strain that caused this round of epidemic is Omikon BA.2 mutant strains, which have the characteristics of strong hidden and fast spread. Most of the incubation period we observe is 3-5 days. Family dissemination is currently the main communication channel. Generally speaking, when a infected person is found in the family, other family members may have been infected, but they are still in the latent period and will be detected in subsequent screening. Essence Third, at the stage of static management in the whole region, although residents are not enough to leave home, there are still many materials in circulation. If there are objects contaminated by viruses, infection is not caused after contact. Our reporter Zuo Yan",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-14/3.htm,4/14/22,3rd edition: Shanghai News,

For freshness, a pot of chicken soup was burned overnight, and a bowl of chicken soup noodles were eaten in the morning. How can I know that something has come. Property management calls chickens, saying that this chicken is ordered by Room 301. I was shocked, and this courier box was clearly written in Room 501. In fact, the delivery person wrote wrong. This chicken is indeed room 301. His son called and said that the chicken he ordered would not express it at 1 pm. Oops, this chicken is not a chicken, and it is mixed back and forth. I want to pay Room 301 and review the reckless things. My wife recommends sending half of the chickens to return the owner. I said it didn't need it, my wife said it was needed, and the two were arguing. This incident was not good, and the neighbors had to be ""jumping chickens and dogs"", with red ears. Relatives and friends from all walks of life have made suggestions and participated in the ""chicken"" (set) wisdom. In summary, the ""chicken"" is as follows: 1. Give the chickens sent by the son; 2. The neighbors eat each other without losing a friendly exchange; Disposal, let's talk about it; 5. Friendly negotiation is the best way to solve; 6. Give half of the people who have not burned, send half of the son, and give people one chicken and two chickens. 7. Send half, and pay for the whole chicken, which is perfect; 8. In order to avoid the suspect of infection, half of the left can not be delivered; 10. What is lacking now is that the supplies are not money, you have to pay back the chickens; 11. No apology, the wrong is the shipper, write the wrong house number on the courier box, and give the son to the neighbor to the neighbors; 12. If you are ""strict with your wife"", you will listen to your wife. If not, you will also listen to your wife ... The property told me that the chicken was bought at 88 yuan in Room 301, and I seemed to understand the ""owner"" request. So three things were done: 1. Apologize; 2. repay; 3.

I hung the chicken at the door of the ""owner"", turned around and returned, WeChat notification. The neighbor's affection was reasonable, and after receiving the payment, a small matter had passed. The chickens who sent them were unwavering, saying that they had already ordered it, and the refrigerator was full. The big deal is settled in that simple solution. The wife proposed to send the chicken to the neighbors needed. My family lived in the door 502, and Xiao Shen, who had just ended the single. On the day of the sealing of the community, Xiao Shen and his wife were in their parents' homes. Can't go out of the door of the control, ""orphan people"" spent 20 days. So we hung the chicken at the door of Room 502 and then notified him. Unexpectedly, it didn't take long for our house to be opened, and Xiao Shen came to the chicken, saying that he couldn't eat it alone. As soon as he turned, he picked up a snack again, saying that it was a crispy small cake, suitable for us. In desperation, the wife gave the chicken to the door of Room 601 again. The male owner went out of Africa and couldn't return the epidemic. The hostess Xiao You said that he had bought a lot of groups. The wife suddenly remembered another old neighbor on the same floor. She now lives in another high -rise of the same community, so she sends a message saying that they will be sent. People are from Fujian, with three generations of six generations. vegetable. 15 minutes later, the doorbell rang, and the old neighbor's daughter -in -law Jingjing shouted a gift package at the door. She thought that our child was not around and it was inconvenient to buy things. So a bag of bones, a bag of pork belly, and a bag of egg were sent. The wife took the opportunity to hand her a bag with chicken, loose cakes, cabbage, and onions. If she didn't accept it, she asked her to bring the gift package back. In this way, this chicken was finally sent to Fujian. Sealing control, the friendship that cannot be sealed through the ground. His wife lamented that he had moved here for more than ten years. This time, the community was closed, and the neighborhood relationship was ""unblocked"" and found that his neighbors were so good! It's so good that there is no place to break the iron shoes ...

Space,"In the epidemic, the benevolent is my teacher",Space,"Peng Rui Gao's ""Ren"" is the easiest Chinese character, but it is the most amazing virtue. In the epidemic, ""benevolence"" and ""not benevolent"" are like water, and they are particularly clear. So people saw the benevolent and the role model. On March, a wave of epidemic came suddenly. Under the leadership of the neighborhood committees, thousands of residents in our community do not go out closed and guard against death. In the case of surrounded by surroundings, we maintain the clear reputation of ""one side of the pure land"". Everyone was looking at each other, and it was full of pride. Unexpectedly, ""Break"" suddenly appeared: neighbors A lived in the city center, and a certain day of self -feelings. I went to the municipal hospital for nucleic acid testing. here). The most difficult thing to understand is that after she entered the community, she didn't say anything, but quietly lined up into the team to test the nucleic acid test with us ... Until that day, the city center ""Bai Bai"" and the police car drove into our community. The positive report detected by municipal hospitals can only be the truth. The neighbors exploded this time: Why did A return to hide from the report, and do not report it, and do it do a nucleic acid test with us? ""Pure Land"" was broken, and the hearts were stunned; what was even more worrying was that neighbors who were tested with A were positive. Obviously, the risk of virus transmission is expanding. Later, it was detected, and even two mixed inspection tubes were abnormal, which means that 20 residents will receive re -examination! 20, which 20 are it? Neighbors are eager to know their house number. Because the ""break"" brought by A makes every inch of air above the community full of weird variables. At this time, neighbors B sent a letter in the group -dear neighbors: Yesterday, my three people participated in nucleic acid testing. Today, I reported that my husband was negative. My daughter and I are at home, wearing a mask, and not turning on the air conditioner; my husband lives in the other room. Please pay attention to the protection. As soon as this letter was issued, the group suddenly made a good WeChat- ""In a very time, your frankness is very valuable. I hope you are safe."" Responsible neighbors, our destiny and common ... ""The neighbor A, who had been invited by Dabai, was condemned by many people at this time, and some even had to hold her responsibility. The story is not over yet. On this night, people knew B's identity. It turned out that she was a broadcast host of a TV station. The neighbors who are familiar with her say that she is always low -key, and the frankness in this WeChat is just the natural revealing of her character.

Everyone was still sending a letter to B in the middle of the night, and I hope she has nothing to do with all the recipients. I believe that night, B and 19 other neighbors were also difficult to sleep.

The next day, 20 neighbor test reports came: B Family B Family Family Family Family Family Family Family Both are negative, but the community adds two more positives. The world loves life.

""The Shanghai epidemic was urgent. In early April, the city 120 emergency center urgently recruited telephone call volunteers. I worked at the city's blood center. I am one of the first 30 sanitary system volunteers to join the city's 120 emergency centers for emergency reporters. The volunteer's job is from 8 am to 3 pm. In the first few days, the ringtone of the peak period made my ears buzzing, and countless answers and sending orders almost collapsed my brain. I remember that one day, when I left the emergency center, the number of calls that day had reached more than 60,000 times. Later, I specially cared about it. More than double, reaching the highest in history. ""Time is life, and ringtones are commands."" In this special period, residents have inconvenient travel, and patients' various medical needs, whether it is emergencies, dialysis, inspection, or re -examination, dictation, and replacement. My position is at the 120 scheduling command center. For a moment, I keep answering the phone, recorded information, and issuing a car list. To extract valid information from the family's call in the shortest time, and sort out emergency and non -emergency situations, not only the citizen's emotions on the phone, but I must always suppress my inner anxiety, listen patiently, and listen patiently. Explain carefully. At this time, I really realized what is ""role model"". More than 80 staff members in the dispatch center are very young. They work for nearly 16 hours a day. They eat and live in the unit. They often work hard to answer the phone while ""swallowing rice"". They are undoubtedly the people who speak the most in Shanghai. Only to allow more citizens to be entrusted. There is also a prospective mother in the dispatcher. Like everyone, to overcome the physiological discomfort during pregnancy, stick to the scheduling position, everyone is worried about her body, she always answered: ""I have good physical fitness, yes!"" Due to the long -term sitting sitting for a long time, I sat sitting for a long time. Many people suffer from chronic diseases, and some gurgling drinking water is because the blood sugar is high; some hold the waist and stand on the acceptance call because the lumbar spondylosis is ""looking for the door"". But they always insisted on, insisted, and then insisted, no one fell. In order to cope with the amount of surge, the city 120 emergency center and the same administrative staff of me also rushed on the front line, her throat was dumb, her eyes were swollen, and the gums were swollen. That medical is white. Everyone is doing their best to answer each phone in time to ensure that the patient's information collection is completed in the shortest time, asking the main complaint, asking the address, contact information, etc., and sending a first -aid car as soon as possible. I deeply realized that those who can persist in this post are based on responsibility, but also because of the awe of life and a strong love for the city. In the phone I received, there were covid-19 patients for help, some citizens with physical discomfort and suddenly felt difficulty in breathing, some quasi-mothers who were closed to break the calmness, and some funny cats were caught. Little boys ... Some patients with minor injuries have dealt with the wounds by self -disinfection, bandaging and other operations through telephone guidance; some people take the initiative to cancel the call through the help of the community. They said that in a special period, the valuable resources of ambulances must be left to those who really need it. During the volunteer, in fact, more of the work of soothing and consulting. Every time I answer the phone, I have to take a deep breath to calm down. Although many citizens are facing various difficulties, they all restrain their emotions and work hard.

Space,24 -hour Shanghai -Hangzhou Pharmaceutical Police People together to send medicines,Kidney transplant patient Xiaofang continued to give life medicine,"At more than 3 pm yesterday, a police car traveled on the Xupu Bridge. On the back seat of Shi Zihao, the police station of the Jiuting Police Station of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau, a pack of life -saving pills from Hangzhou Yuan Road -used to prevent and treat kidney transplant patients The postoperative infection was scattered. At the intersection of Honglin, the Puding Highway, he handed over the medicine to the police of the Cai Road Police Station of the Pudong Public Security Bureau. Police cars continued to fly until they arrived in Heqing Town. The hope of sending the whole family for Ms. Wang, who had been waiting on the roadside, and a 24 -hour love relay led by the Xinmin Evening News ""War Epidemic · Bang Nong"". Successfully. The whole city was difficult to find in the city in 2021. Ms. Wang's daughter and Xiaofang, who was 30 years old, unfortunately suffered from uremia. After a year of waiting, at the beginning of this year, Xiaofang underwent renal transplant surgery at Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University. According to the doctor's order, after half a year after kidney transplantation, Xiaofang needed to take the Disposable tablets of Genchenolova every day to prevent postoperative infection. Originally, she was more convenient to buy medicines from JD.com every month, but due to the impact of the epidemic, the new batch of drugs failed to arrive. The price of this medicine is more than 30 yuan, which is not expensive, but due to strong targetedness, there are not many major hospitals. The family searched all the hospitals and network channels in Shanghai, and they were all out of stock. What happened in the event of a daughter's suspension of drugs, Ms. Wang did not dare to imagine. Seeing that the pill box was about to the bottom, she took the mentality of trying to ask for help from the Xinmin Evening News. The road to seeking medicine across Shanghai and Hangzhou was at noon the day before yesterday. After receiving the help of Ms. Wang, the reporter contacted the resources of all parties on the one hand. On the one hand, through various channels such as the circle of friends and the WeChat group, Ms. Wang asked the medicine together. ""Can't you try it from other places? Please help the Shanghai Medical Team?"" ""I found this, and I would like to ask the doctor if they could not replace it!"" The circle of friends of the reporter was surrounded by enthusiasm. After contacting the enthusiastic citizen, Ms. Hao, Foshang Shangxun Taiyun COO He Qiang heard a helping hand. He Qiang said that the company's company focuses on the home health consumer product line directly and the full supply chain service, and has rich channel resources. ""I try my best to find it, wait for my news!"" Online channels? No! Hospital warehouse? No! Continue to find it, continue to ask, the phone has been hit from Shanghai to Zhejiang. At 9 o'clock the night before, He Qiang excitedly told reporters that his persistence was finally effective -in the pharmacy in Xiaoshan Hospital in Zhejiang, there was medicine! Coincidentally, the company happened to have a truck from Hangzhou to Shanghai the next day. As long as you can catch up, the medicine can be sent to Shanghai! Zhao Gang, the person in charge of Yunlin Quality, is a novice dad. Although he needs to take care of his wife and children, in order to send a life -saving medicine to the Shanghai girl who lives, he actively invited him in Hangzhou. In the early morning of yesterday, he drove more than an hour to the hospital for Xiaofang for a good medicine, and took another hour to send the medicine to the truck. Police cars help the completion of the relay affected by traffic control. How can the medicine be transported from Songjiang warehouse to Pudong? After receiving the help of reporters, the Songjiang Public Security Branch and the Pudong Public Security Branch happily agreed: the last love relay, we take over! ""The truck has set off.""

This bag of Genxirovirville's scattered tablets may never think that his ""footprint"" will receive so many concerns. At 5 pm yesterday, Pudong Heqing Town. ""If there is anything else to help during the epidemic, you can also find us!"" After receiving the medicine, he heard the police's warm words, Ms. Wang cried excitedly.

Space,Home Flowers and Plants,Space,"Earlier last month, Dai Rong had not moved in Bai Yulan in Fudan Garden. I hope that I have eager to buy magnolia branches from Yunnan. Those branches that are tingling are half tall, and the branches are covered with light brown buds with a brush -shaped tip. According to the shopkeeper's instructions, the flowers were soaked in the deepest barrel at home for a long time, and the water was changed, sprayed with water, and cut pruning. I looked forward to the buds of the buds, and broke the imprisonment of the bracts and opened it into white flowers. The Ming people Cheng Yuwen's ""Flower Moon Order"" recorded the ""Magnolia Solution"" in February of the lunar calendar, simply a single ""solution"", but it made people feel vivid. However, it may be that the temperature in Shanghai is too low, and this magnolia has not blossomed. Asked the owner whether the method of raising flowers was improper, they did not say anything, and immediately said that I would change me for free. ""Give you a bunch of Ao Mei, good for raising, and long flowering period."" After launching sale, it is exempted from choice difficulty and unnecessary tangles. It is really a good thing for Liu Danming in this extraordinary spring. The Australian Mei was beautiful, and the pink flowers were brought out the next day. I did not expect that it had been shaking for a few weeks later, and it became an inconvenient day to accompany my table flowers. Before the cherry blossoms on the campus opened, the school started a quasi -closed management model. Fortunately, colleagues and students stationed on campus from time to time ""live broadcast"" flowers through the circle of friends, from the initial buds to semi -open and bloom. Perhaps the scope of activities is small, and there are fewer miscellaneous things. They cherish flowers and spring light than previous years. I couldn't go out of the outdoor to see the flowers for the time being. Jasmine's old branches burst out of the new buds of sesame. The duck grass is higher than the day every day. In this summer, the blue flowers will be bloomed. The first year is cut from the roadside. Must be ruthless. The new leaves of rosemary made me a little bit stunned. If I thought that if I cut off a few branches to my friends earlier, he could sprinkle a little green and fragrant on the steak recently. He said that steak is the most high -quality protein he has to stock up. It is a pity that the empty flower pot in the corner of the flower frame is unfortunate, and the green onions bought in Chongming Farm were planted and planted. The marks left by these plants are quite simple in line with the seemingly simple, sometimes luxurious ""flowers on the table, vegetables in the bowl"". Knowing that I love flowers, someone sent me a set of magazine pictures, and each of them was holding a bouquet of a woman. Those chrysanthemums, hydrangea, roses, and sword orchids are quite amazing, almost covering people's upper body. If you hold something else, you can't help but be embarrassed, but because it is a flower, it looks quite graceful. I sent my new book to my friends in Beijing. She took a illustration in the book and asked me what the blue -purple grass flower was called. ""Arab mother -in -law."" A few days later, she sent photos of Arab mother -in -law on the wild. I asked her to pay tribute to those little flowers on behalf of me. In Shanghai this spring, it is lucky to buy flowers who buy flowers before the flower shop stops. If there is no flower, the trees that look at the window on the balcony will be a retreat and tenacity. ""No spring will not come.""

Shenzhou -thirteen manned flying task has achieved successful success,"Space business trip for half a year, three people returned home",Space,"At 9:56 today, Shenzhou -thirteen manned spacecraft returned to the cabin to successfully land in the Dongfeng landing field. On -site medical supervisors and medical insurance staff confirmed that astronauts Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu had a good physical condition. Intersection At 11:05, the astronauts went out of the cabin safely by the group. Zhai Zhigang's first out of the cabin, he said with a full spirit: ""I am proud of our great motherland!"" Wang Yaping, the second out of the cabin, said: ""The 183 -day space journey is very difficult, but we are not alone. Back to the arms of the motherland, I was very happy. I want to tell my daughter that the mother who picks the stars is back! ""Ye Guangfu's third out of the cabin, he said affectionately:"" I realized the dream of flying sky and can proudly report to the motherland. We are currently. The body is very good and strive to make better results in the future. ""Step by step is at 0.44 today, Shenzhou 13 manned spacecraft and the space station sky and the core cabin successfully separated. The road of Shenzhou 13 is simply divided into four steps. The first step is to return separation and brake adjustment. After the manned spacecraft is separated from the core compartment combination of the space station, the first adjustment should be performed. After the direction is adjusted, the orbital compartment is separated from the return capsule, and the adjustment position is made again. After that, the cabin system was launched, and the return cabin entered the return orbit from the original flight track. This process is called braking off -track. The return cabin can only return to the earth with a suitable angle with the geocentrus of the earth. The second step is to push back the separation. When 145 kilometers from the ground, promote the separation of the compartment and the return capsule. The return capsule continues to go home alone. It will enter the atmosphere about 100 kilometers from the ground. The surroundings of the return capsule were surrounded by flames, and it looked like a fireball. The third step is to open the umbrella. At 10 kilometers away from the ground, a large umbrella of 1,200 square meters is opened, and the spacecraft returns to the back compartment to continue to slow down. The fourth step is about 1 meter from the ground, starting 4 anti -push engines to perform the last deceleration, and the spacecraft landed safely. In this process, the biggest challenge facing astronauts is overload and impact. In the process of pushing back, the return capsule and the air rubbed severe friction, which made the temperature at the bottom of the back cabin as high as thousands of degrees Celsius. The return capsule will also enter the lost ""black barrier area"". This stage is the most dangerous step in the entire return process. The astronauts who return to the cabin must bear the pressure of 4 times their weight, to bear the severe vibration, and enter the state of loss. Essence During the last 10 kilometers of the return, the moment the return cabin parachute was opened, the aerospace staff's body had to undergo a large overload instantly. When landing, the astronauts had to bear a violent impact. Returning to Shenzhou 13 is not only the longest spacecraft in my country, but also the fastest spacecraft to return. Compared with Shenzhou 12 manned spacecraft, Shenzhou -13 manned spacecraft uses a fast return mode. Under the condition of not changing hardware software, returning to the earth is shortened from 18 laps to 5 laps, and the return time is shortened for nearly 20 hours for nearly 20 hours. Essence Experts introduced that the spacecraft flying around the earth is to wait for the opportunity to return. At the same time, the ground also needs to carry out preparations such as parameter injection and strategy formulation during this time. By reasonable cutting and adjustment of the flight task event, the compressed operation time is reduced to 5 laps, which not only improves the return of the return task execution efficiency, but also makes the astronauts return to experience more comfortable. In addition, in the past, the spacecraft and the space station realized the connection. The position of the radar and telescope needed to determine the position. ""Take the calculation"", adjust the track a little bit, shorten the distance until the docking. Today, the Beidou system can give the position of the space station and spacecraft very accurately, and the calculation is in place. The return of the three astronauts safely not only means that the task of Shenzhou 13 is successfully concluded, but also another layer of significance: the key technical verification stage of the China Space Station was successfully ended. China Aerospace Science and Technology Group revealed that the manned space space station project will complete 6 major tasks this year, including two cargo spacecraft, Shenzhou 14 and Shenzhou 15 twice, including Tianzhou -4 and Tianzhou 5. Sky Experimental Curring I, Mengtian Experimental Curm II launch, and the docking of the Rail Communication Fair, the outlet event and the return mission of the spacecraft, will be fully built this year.

Space,Sticking together,Space,"I have a lot of time in Shanghai recently because I am writing a ""big book"" about Shanghai. From March 16th, I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel in Pudong. Unexpectedly, it was more than thirty days in this room. Three or four days before March 28, we discovered a positive patient, so my building was sealed. Looking out of my current room, how beautiful the spring outside, bird language, but I can only look out in this room. The grass and trees in the city stood silently with us, and they were still growing up and sticking to the city. I have two things every day. One is the content of the interview some time before the consolidation, the other is to consolidate the idea, and the other is to pay attention to the epidemic of Shanghai. As a writer, this epidemic affects my writing, and frequently goes downstairs to nucleic acids every day, making my heart unable to calm down for a long time. The epidemic in Shanghai has a direct relationship with everyone who lives here. I think of the epidemic that I have experienced several epidemics and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. The epidemic is different from the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2003, I talked about the panic of the people at the time in the ""Beijing Defense War"" I wrote. The time node of the Shanghai epidemic is almost the same, how similar people's thoughts are. This is my personal experience. But the time difference has been different for nearly two decades. The epidemic in Shanghai has spread wider, and the personal feelings brought differently. Either the epidemic in Shanghai or the SARS epidemic. I think that the common thing is that we will be able to win. As a person in the epidemic, I may have more historical dimensions about the incidents. When we look at Shanghai, we must look objectively and comprehensively. There are many noodles in Shanghai, don't just see the side of its bustling city. Shanghai has experienced many pains and disasters in history. My ancestors have struggled in Shanghai and experienced the disaster again and again. For New China, countless Shanghai children have presented their lives. Shanghai is a great city. In the past few days, I wrote the latest article ""When Difficulties, We Pay more to the Spirit of Shanghai"", the spirit of the Shanghai spirit has been settled in history. In difficulties, the Shanghai spirit can show its strength and richness. Now is the darkness before dawn, the darkness will disappear soon, I believe this. In 2020, I wrote two books, ""Shanghai Emoticon"" and ""First Time"" to record the history of the Shanghai prevention and control epidemic. When I was writing, I have been observing. I sincerely feel that Shanghai has done well. I do n’t panic, there is a way, a way, intelligent, capable, and resources, but a city that sings Kaige There are always some setbacks, just like each of us. Now that I am writing this new book, I have been thinking about such a question: How should we look at the city of Shanghai? Faced with this epidemic, we received extremely rare lessons. Such an experience and lessons need to be carefully summarized. For the urban development of our later, a modern city, a people -centered city, how to summarize is better, which is of great significance.

The troops were running on the night, and the horse's puppets in the third class fell. Lian Jian said: ""Board backwards, see the horses of the third class, pick it up."" As a result, there were a few people that passed on, so he heard the strange things: ""Sima Yi's pants are dropped, what about us?"" Become a rumor. Sometimes misunderstandings and misunderstandings are mistaken for rumors. Therefore, this requires us to learn to solve misunderstandings, do not believe in rumors, and do not spread rumors.

However, in the long process of growth, the half -knowledge of fur and external skills is easy to achieve. I feel that my sesame flowers are high every day. Especially smart children, they can be proud of their heroes. However, if this world can be mixed with only cleverness, it is too simple. It can even be said that no matter which line in this world, in the internal power of one -inch, you must have the power of flooding. It is not known whether it is successful. This is because there are many things except for the difficulty of the surface, and there is a huge improving space in the depths.

He wanted to stand out from the tens of millions of green onion oil cake merchants. The price was that he made green onion cakes for a lifetime. Maybe you will say, I will just do it, don't need that good. Then you have to accept your ordinary rather than emphasizing your cleverness. The so -called clever is those who are closer to the outstanding, saying that they are not born in Rome directly. They are the most conditional people who have reached the top.

Space,Resolutely say no of raising prices,Space,"Tu Yufeng was controlled at home. A foreign friend who had not been contacted suddenly sent WeChat to care: ""I have seen the price of Shanghai now?"" It is true that the nerves have emerged when they are raising prices. Since March 14, the market regulatory authorities have issued reminders to various market entities more than 40,000 copies, and more than 200 cases have been investigated. Typical cases of violations of law have been announced. For example, in the Jin Xiaowen restaurants, in the case of the price case, the parties' entrance price of only 3 yuan per catty was sold on the takeaway platform for a price of 16.8 yuan per catty. The Minhang Police, in conjunction with the relevant departments, discovered that a fruit shop opened the seal without authorization under the drive of the interests, opened the door to open the door, and sold a green vegetable to 26 yuan, which made people unyielding. In the ""community group purchases"" that are in wind and water, there are endless chaos such as sitting on the ground, raising prices, and short lack of two pounds. For example, in recent days, Yan received a 1720 vegetable package order, which agreed to include two pounds of celery, two pounds of white radish, one pound of tomatoes, and one pound of cucumbers. In the same batch of orders, Yan Mou provided only one of the two of the lettuce (about one and a half pounds), two tomatoes (about one pound) and three greens (about one pound). Below, significantly increase sales prices. Not long ago, a rider in Shanghai made a hot search on Weibo in Shanghai. The reason was that he made 10,000 pieces a day, and the user rewarded more than 7,000. I see a lot of comments on the Internet to express their identification: Some say that this ""reward"" is a market -regulating behavior and an affirmation of consumers for the work of the courier brother; some say that sending express delivery is risky. I earn hard money and risk money. But what I want to say is that in the epidemic, don't you send it if you do not reward. Isn't this kind of reward be a disguised price? What is the difference between this pound of potatoes sold for 16.8 yuan and a green vegetable for 26 yuan? Make up prices in the law. The ""Price Law of the People's Republic of China"" has long been explicitly. Operators must not fabricate or spread the price increase information, make up prices, and promote the high rise in commodity prices. A few days ago, the Shanghai Market Supervision Bureau and the Municipal Development and Reform Commission also jointly issued the ""Guiding Opinions on the Prevention and Control of the Epidemic Prevention and Control"", which can be fined up to 3 million yuan in prices. It is not only the harm of the price of prices not only infringes the interests of consumers, violates business ethics, and allows the citizens to suffer it. More importantly, in the current critical period of common resistance to resistance, strengthening confidence and stability is an important guarantee. Therefore, it is urgent to severely crack down on prices. Market authorities should actively carry supervision responsibilities to allow ""getting epidemic and money"" to pay a heavy price; the general public should report complaints on illegal acts and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. Of course, governance to coaxing prices should also be combined, and the government should work hard to make a good supply to meet the daily life of the people. Li Qiang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said that it is necessary to make up the determination to open up the blocking point. The government and the market will work together to better play the role of protecting enterprises and platform enterprises. If we want to achieve the ultimate victory of resistance, we need to pay great efforts. We must not relax every link.

""Several things to open the door"" Wake up in the early morning ""Oriental Yaoyao Building No. 3 Information Daily: After the statistics of the heads of you, the test of the nucleic acid test is as follows ... Epidemic report: Today's whole nucleic acid or antigen detection, a certain building nucleic acid detection is strange User reviewed full yin. Materials related: The head of the group organized the community resident group to buy epidemic prevention materials and love donations, the details as follows ... Other matters: One household medicine has returned, two new households have been added, and a volunteer must be collected ... … ""In this information daily newspaper, it responded to the"" several things to open the door ""that the residents cared about during the sealing and control, so that everyone had the bottom of their hearts, and the relevant volunteer service work also started in an orderly manner. Gu Yan, a resident volunteer of the ""80s"", is one of the first young people who participate in the team of volunteers. He said that his wife is a medical staff who has been away from home for a month and is still working in a hotel. Every time there is a medical staff to the community to detect nucleic acids, he will think of his wife, ""compare his heart, if you have the help of volunteers, the medical staff can relax."" ""In Building 3 ', the"" Most Beautiful Aunt Volunteer Three Group ""has a cheerful personality and dancing, and the enthusiasm for serving the community is very high. It is said that we work at home very hard. Young volunteer Zhang Lijuan said with a smile, ""Later, we simply set up the chief system. The first floor was mostly 5 households, and one head was responsible for the order of the order of antigen or nucleic acid. Well, use the announcement to inform the statistical results of all residents on all levels. The sense of responsibility of the head of the head is stronger, the efficiency of nucleic acid detection has greatly improved, and the testing of the test is not omitted. "" Measures, group buying implements a whitelist system, and the group purchase list is prohibited. The head of the group's volunteers releases the head of the regiment daily ... ""Recently, a freshly baked group purchase convention disclosed to the residents of the community. Zhu Feng, the chief coordinator of the head of the group, is a ""post -80s"" and works in a real estate company. ""The community has been closed, and the shortage of materials has become the most concerned about everyone. Occasionally, I helped the neighbor Tang Qiwen organize a group purchase of Sam together, and the feeling of being a head of the group."" But he found that because of the man's hand Insufficient and group purchase are mostly foods. Group purchase materials often have not been effectively eliminated, and there is a risk of virus transmission. Therefore, starting from April 8th, he and resident volunteers based on the relevant information founded by the parties, referring to the hospital, and the isolation point such as epidemic prevention standards to write the management system for group purchase, including the head of the regiment's management filing and the principle of material prevention prevention and epidemic prevention. Isolate the ""gesture"" with the three districts, and use the icon to show it clearly. The reporter saw that although it is a group purchase within the community, the professional level of the page is comparable to a professional platform. The employees of the advertising company in the community are the US editors. New media employees Wang Cong is responsible for the operation of the official number of the community ""Kuai Group"". Daily prediction of the group purchase information of the community and the upcoming group purchase information on the day. According to the owner's voting, the varieties that the well -known brands and residents need good reputation can not only meet everyone's shopping needs, but also set up a ""firewall"" to prevent the virus from attack. The exquisite posters of the group purchase were released on the first day of the public account of the community, and more than 10,000 visits were obtained. Not only in the community, the influence also radiated to some surrounding areas, and some communities followed suit. ""Now the regulations on group purchase management have been upgraded from the initial version 1.0 to version 2.0. Only two links are required, and residents can find the content of the group purchase. The head of the volunteer group also introduced the supervisor system to make the group purchase more open and transparent. ""Zhu Feng said. The exclusive service group cares for special groups, and young people have stood up one after another, and the fields they pay attention to are not just young groups. ""Our family lacks green leafy vegetables. I don't know if the property can help buy something?"" Recently, the help from Aunt Wang, the old man from the community, has attracted everyone's attention. It turned out that only two elderly people at home would not buy them. In the same building, there was a young ""head"" who took the initiative to send food to the old couples and purchased them one by one. Volunteers of the neighborhood committee and other residents thought that similar needs for pregnant women, patients, and elderly people in the community can care for ""right -point"" and not allow a person to be helpless in the sealing community. As a result, a ""sending warm"" exclusive service WeChat group was established. After counting the number of relevant personnel, young volunteers such as the heads of the heads care for these key groups. ""Once young people start, the efficiency is 'lever'."" Xia Hao, a resident volunteer, lamented. Some people say that if they want a barrel of oil and a noodle, some people want 5 pounds of rice and noodles. They need to be reached by young volunteers. They will send them to the door immediately for the ""uncle"". There are chronic drugs for the elderly, and the residents and volunteers have implemented it to help buy medicine. In the community, the neighborhood mutual assistance documents are also updated in real time. Resident Evanians Ye Xia said, ""In special periods, everyone did not talk about it, and they bowed their heads to do some small things that they could and warm. Although things were small, it was expensive. What else in the world is worthy of always yearning and sometimes it can be obtained, that is the true feelings of the world.

No wonder every time you ask, the daughter -in -law never talks, but the son answered: Very good, there is everything in the refrigerator, the child is very obedient on the Internet class, don't worry. After knowing the secret, we had another worry. His son has been returning early and late every day. He rarely cares about the two children's food, sleeping and studying. He has never burned meals.

Relay and medicine! Online consultation! Urgent purchase and emergency delivery!,"""Public Welfare Alliance"" blows more than 100 emergency help for help",Space,"The medicine of patients with cerebral infarction is broken, the community resistance cadres are difficult to see a doctor, and the 93 -year -old bed elderly diapers are gone ... Don't worry, Allah come to help! In the past few days, many citizens sent out urgent help to the platform of this newspaper's ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" platform. ""Urgent worry"". As of 8:00 this morning, a total of 573 public welfare individuals, 6 public welfare institutions, and 20 public welfare companies have registered to join the ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" public welfare alliance. Patients with cerebral infarction are associated with medicine. Mr. Wang, who lives to the family and lives in the Gongkang Si Village, has to take blood circulation drugs such as blood Seyong for a long time. Due to the sealing of the community, on April 16, the drugs in his family had been used up. In the case of anxiety, Mr. Wang sent the ""emergency medicine"" platform for the ""Emergency Drug"" platform to the ""War Epidemic · Bangnong"" platform. The ""Public Welfare Alliance"" immediately acted and looked around. I first found a number of hospitals and online medical platforms, all feedback without goods. After inquiring from many parties, I finally found Hematomi at the Huangpu Branch of the Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai. On the morning of April 17th, the public welfare company was hungry and took over the delivery task and sent an anti -emergency car to the hospital. The driver Ni Changchun took 4 boxes of medicines from the pharmacist, and quickly sent it to Mr. Wang's community. ""It's really raining in time! With it, my heart is fixed at once."" Mr. Wang was relieved. Anti -epidemic personnel seemed to be a staff member of Pudong New Steel New Village Street Residents Committee on the Internet. For more than a month, Ms. Zhuang has adhered to the front line of resistance in the community to test, material procurement, and medical treatment for residents' nucleic acid testing, material procurement, and medical medicine. But many people don't know that she was a patient with lung cancer, and two years ago, she was found to have nodular diseases and took Chinese herbal herbal medicine to condition her body all year round. Earlier, Ms. Zhuang regularly went to a Chinese medicine department in Enshi, Hubei, and returned to Shanghai according to the prescribed prescription. But the sudden epidemic disrupted her treatment plan. Now she has broken the medicine for more than a month. Hubei medicine cannot be sent, and she has no time to go out to catch the medicine. Will repeat it again. ""Ms. Zhuang was very worried. The member of the Public Welfare Alliance Shanghai Tai Kuntang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital immediately said that he would ask the experienced Chinese medicine to consult online for Ms. Zhuang. Yesterday, Qian Xinlan, a well -known Chinese medicine expert in Tai Kuntang, carefully asked Ms. Zhuang's condition through the video and gave judgments and suggestions. This week, Tai Kuntang will send Chinese medicine to Ms. Zhuang as soon as possible. The bed of the old man asked the citizen Yu Grandma for help with the citizen Yu's grandma at the age of 93. He usually bed in bed and needs to use adult diaper. In the past, Ms. Yu was very convenient to buy through Taobao, but after the epidemic occurred, the courier was suspended, and the merchants could not ship, and the inventory at home was almost exhausted. She found a nearby pharmacy, and she didn't find a suitable product. In desperation, she sent it for help to ""Xinmin Gang Nong"". The ""Public Welfare Alliance"" volunteers buy through multiple channels after confirming the product specifications. On April 17th, I finally looked forward to the good news: Yangpu Store, Meizhou Da Pharmacy, just entered a group of corresponding adult diapers. After knowing the situation, the pharmacy manager specifically reserved a box for the elderly. The public welfare company ""SF Express"" sent the little brother to the pharmacy to pick up the goods, and then sent it to the women's community. ""I did not expect that there was such a large box, enough grandma has been spent more than a month!"" Ms. Yu looked at it again and again.

Space,Honey Best,Space,"Ling Mengqian sorted out the old things and checked the selected tapes of children's songs collected that year. The personal albums of the family and word writer Liu Ming, and there are compilations of composers such as Pan Zhensheng, which contains many songs loved by children and children. With these lustered tape boxes, I saw the old people, and Liu Ming came in front of the teacher's cordial face. The teacher and I met with Liu Ming because I participated in the amateur creation group of the Xuhui District Cultural Museum that year. The very time was about to enter the end. The social environment was loose. Various group art activities were unearthed like Xiaochun seedlings. Teacher Liu is a full -time counselor of the Cultural Museum's creation group. He is responsible for poetry and music creation. He heard that he specializes in writing children's songs and will write lyrics. I have published a lot of works. I can't help but respect. After being familiar with each other, Teacher Liu sometimes wrote a satisfactory work and hummed in the office of the creation group in front of us. Whenever he was willing, his middle -aged man was like a big child, shaking his head and shaking his head, showing a little smile. He knew that I was trying to write children's poems and fairy tales. I told me that children's poems were the same as children's lyrics. They belonged to the twin brothers. The difference was that the lyrics paid attention to the sense of rhythm and the text was more simple. The author must have childlikeness, good at finding materials in daily life, picking pollen like bees, and processing and refining to write good works. Children and children are the flowers of the motherland. Excellent children's songs are indispensable spiritual food. You may wish to write some children's lyrics and I can compose. It's hot to say. With his enthusiasm and encouragement, in the future, I successively created dozens of children and children's lyrics, published in words such as ""Lyrics"" and ""Children's Songs"". In addition to the many songs such as ""Planting Sunflower in the kindergarten"" and ""Banner in the Heart"" composed by Teacher Liu, many of them were sung by other composers. Among them, ""A Star on the Mountain Road"" was awarded the National Children's Song Gold Award by CCTV, and won the 1995 ""Five One Engineering Awards"" in 1995. If I have achieved some results on children's lyrics, I have a careful counseling and help with Teacher Liu. Liu Ming will be a well -known musician Pan Zhensheng who created ""One Points"" and ""Miles"". He is a close friend in the creation of children's songs. They have all experienced the experience of music teaching in primary and secondary schools, and they are infatuated with children's song creation. Later, although a branch was far away in the Ningxia Literature Federation, one worked at the Shanghai Cultural Museum and Junior officials. For many years, they continued to work for the booming children's songs, and they were improving in art and fruitful. Teacher Liu wrote thousands of children and children's song works such as ""Bending Sickle"", ""Little Pig Sleeping"", ""A Group of Ducklings"", and many works have been published at home and abroad. If children's songs are compared to sweet honey, Liu Ming will be a hard -working honeymaker, and I miss him deeply as a post -scholar.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-18/7.htm,4/18/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,
Space,Mom in monitoring,Space,"Since Meli had a camera for my mother's family last year, I can see her old man anytime, anywhere. This feels so good. Although it seems a bit unfair to my mother, because her privacy is gone, she doesn't seem to care. She understood that we were the mood of children, and just resolved that she had said that things were gone before, and worried that it was a heart disease that aunt took away (my sister and I seriously suspected that she could not find it.) Mom lives alone and has only one road with her sister's house. She loves freedom throughout her life and does not like to live with our juniors. She said to me that the elderly have different living habits and you have a different living habits. If I live together for a long time, I am afraid that there will be contradictions. If I have troubled with my two daughters, you are nothing to do. It's hard to do if it's not good. She has her hidden concerns. The location of the camera is facing the living room. By the way, you can see the door of the kitchen and toilet, and the figure of people's movement inside. There are only two rooms. But don't I want to see these? When did the mother get up, when to eat, and when to turn off the lights to sleep. Did she go out? Auntie helped her make a few dishes today. Even several times, I heard which drama in Peking opera, which drama chasing in the TV opera, or which singer sang. I think although my mother's usual entertainment life is slightly monotonous by the TV, the TV is more effective than her daughter, because her daughter cannot accompany her from time to time. Seeing the mother's feeling in the monitoring, maybe we should have pretended to have one long ago. For example, she often sat on the sofa and watched TV. When she looked at the crooked head and fell asleep, I would shout to the camera: ""Mom, don't get cold, cover a blanket."" My mother heard that I was calling her to call her I woke up, and I wanted to justify it, and did not fall asleep without falling asleep. Sometimes, she was busy watching her walking around, and the movement was obviously slower than before, so she shouted a few ""Mom"". She went to the camera, as if she saw me in it, surprised, and asked with a smile, this time was my big girl? There is a slightly enlarged mother in the camera, like a happy comedy, I can see me laughed, and I laughed and laughed. There are many times, because my mother and I are happy. I feel more and more, although there is no dad to shout, but my mother can see at any time, but shouting, for me, it is one of the happiest and happy things in the world. Life cannot always be sweet. From the pressure of the body, the pressure of life in the big city, and the repeated epidemic will make my soul sometimes disturbed and emotional lower. At this time, I turned on the camera. As long as I saw my mother's figure, my heart could calm down immediately. Maybe everyone lives with two souls, one is deadly, and the other is hot. These two souls have been fighting for each other, but they have been competing, but they all need an exit. Some people say that he moved to exercise as soon as he came up, and some said that she would buy and buy, and some chose to eat sweets. What about me, looking at my mother, in other words, the end of the universe is the mother in monitoring. Anyway, once the negative emotions have a place to go, the desperate soul escapes, and the steaming soul will come to hug you. Professor Luo Xiang said in the famous saying of extending Dha Erierki: ""Many times, we love the whole human, but do not love specific people, but the true love should be the love of specific individuals.""

Give us a roll of severity. The meat and vegetable gift package you bought for the order, and the young man of 203 mentioned from the door of the community to the door of the house. We have to express some expressions. It's not uncommon, but the real movement happened, and the movement was still unique. Shanghai, a large city with an aging of more than 20 %, is full of vitality and diversity because of the gathered gathered by the South China Sea. Usually, ""the elderly and youth"" do not intersection due to age, identity, and schedule. The close relationship is often concentrated in family relatives or helping the elderly. However, this war -resistant war -effective battle for the presence and control suddenly broke the boundary of the age, and the vibrant young people showed extraordinary. Here is a typical: these days, station B has a ""post -00"" UP owner ""Lahong Sang"" is very popular. The reason is not him. As the head of the building in a certain seal -controlled community in Pudong, the little girl has satisfied a large number of ""zero experience"". The various needs of elderly residents show the ""small shallots"" in the busy and unintelligible supply of pressure and infinite wisdom. Not to mention, seeing that the efficiency of picking up the vegetables from house to house is low, ""Lahong Sang"" has drumped out the ""downstairs to take the material speed reward and punishment mechanism""; some residents do not cooperate with nucleic acid testing, and she will also ""social terror"". The Hedong Lion Roar is urged, but it will soon become a gentle ""little cotton jacket"", calling for uncle and aunt to ""come, come,"" ... As you can see, you are not in a few young people like ""203 couples"" and ""Lahong Sang"" , They used to be taken care of by adults, but in the epidemic, they also took the responsibility with their shoulders: some went out of the house and undertaked to clean up and kill, material transport, and maintained order. Enterprise management, art, new media and other professional advantages, carry out public welfare group purchase, care for the elderly, and psychological assistance. Because many methods from grass -roots practice are effective, they are also absorbed by relevant departments to become ""SOP"" (standard operation processes) that can be replicated and promoted. Just as a young volunteer told me, before the epidemic, most of us felt that happiness in private space was far more than in public life, but in the crisis, the neighborhood helped everyone to find far more in public life than private life than private life. Happiness, like a sentence circulating on the social platform: ""You can't change the weather, but you can change your mood; you can't choose your appearance, but you can choose your expression; The young man who devoted to resistance was mainly from 1994 to 2010 (saying differently).

They are not addicted to selfie, passionate consumption and passiveness. The smaller the more and more closer, and the degree of correlations are getting closer, which is exactly the big stage they use knowledge to create value.

Space ,From marriage to the matchmaker to the anti -epidemic maiden ,Space ,"In the past few days, Wu Nanyao, ""Ginger who has been a soldier"" publishes 40 or fifty similar friends circles every day to connect various resources and needs. Behind this is the countless WeChat and dozens of or hundreds of calls every day. Jiang Hongyun, a transfer officer, from the army to the local area, the nickname of ""Jiang Leifeng"" called all the way. The epidemic in Shanghai was tight, and he was named after he was named but did not have the opportunity to become a ""big white"". He could not leave home every day. This old party member with 37 years of party age was anxious and borrowed from the experience of previous databases to single men and women. The ""circle of friends"" relying on her own mobile phone to make ""big white on the fingertips"" and the red maid who resists. He joined the army in 1980, transferred to Shanghai in 2012, transferred several positions, and worked in the municipal health system for more than 9 years. Jiang Hongyun's WeChat name and the young officer's document in his youth showed his background color: ""Ginger of being a soldier."" Those who have experienced the melting furnace of the army will always surpass their interests and mission, with a upright personality, and the heart of the heart. On March 24, the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee issued a letter to the members of the city. Ginger quickly installed the ""Pioneer Shanghai"" applet and completed the ""dual report"". The ""front line"" ginger was in a hurry. On March 31, Jiang received a WeChat of Liao Yixiang, an old comrade in Wuhan in Wuhan: Jiang's political commissar, Shanghai's epidemic is very heavy. Our company wants to donate 50,000 N95 masks to express a little bit of intention to return to Shanghai Aid Epiderium. Can you help me contact the receiving unit? OK! Ginger quickly released this information in the circle of friends. In less than a minute, Professor Fu Youth, retired veteran and veteran party member of the Navy 905 Hospital replied: The Municipal Public Health Center urgently needed to resist supplies. Ginger immediately notified Wuhan to arrange logistics companies to ship, and they arrived at the Municipal Public Health Center the next day. ""Good things in the end, even the freight is paid by President Liao."" The speed matching was successful, and ginger came out. During the outbreak of Wuhan in 2020, as the general branch and webmaster of the Shanghai Health and Health Commission's foreign supplier supply station, when Shanghai was also very tight, ginger took the team and the workload turned over. As soon as four, the task that was almost impossible to complete was completed to ensure the protection of all foreign medical teams during the epidemic. ""Just believe in Shanghai people, I believe you, the old soldier"" is the evaluation of ginger in the circle. Material deployment is the strength of ginger, which is not enough to go home, but the news can be released through the mobile phone. ""Shanghai's epidemic conditions are serious, and epidemic prevention materials such as masks and protective clothing are urgently needed. If your company wants to contribute love, I am willing to match!"" Sentences, quickly sent to business bresses across the country. In less than 10 hours, the donation plan of more than ten companies flew from the motherland. Guangzhou Shuangyi Group, Hangzhou Licheng Company, Panjia Holding Group, Yantai Family Pharmaceutical Company, Dalian latex company, Guilin Hengbao Company, Shandong Hainuo Group, Shanghai Yingjing Company, Shanghai Wanchuan Medical Device Company, Shanghai name Bang Company ... the list is getting longer and longer. Suddenly, a Vietnamese phone came in from the United States. It seems that the name is Chen Liming. He is the wife of the late famous film actor Yang Zaihuan, and is also a enthusiastic and charity veteran and old party member. She saw Jiang's fundraising activities from WeChat, and took the initiative to say that she would donate to the Shanghai Respects of Shanghai. She asked Beijing colleagues to check the company's inventory, 450 N95 masks, more than 200 sets of protective clothing, other masks and hand -toilet Materials are all sent to Shanghai with express delivery. Although the old friend Wang Weibin is not a party member, in the eyes of Jiang, he is a Communist Party member. He very enthusiasticly contacted relevant departments such as civic affairs, Chongming District, Putuo District, and Minhang District as units to receive donations. He was worried that the transportation of materials for the donation was prone to problems, and he took the initiative to provide the mobile phone number of the leaders of the Municipal Traffic Police Corps. Zhang Liqiang, the former director of the Shanghai Institute of Health Education, was an old party member. After retirement, he has been enthusiastic about engaging in public welfare activities. He learned that Jiang was busy donating anti -epidemic supplies and took the initiative to store some materials to store some materials at the Hu Jinhua Health Education Promotion Center to solve the problem of material turnover venues. Mr. Hu Jinhua, a well -known health education expert, old predecessor, and old party member, also gives great support for the public welfare actions launched by ginger. The fundraising, just a highlight of ""big white on the fingertips"". There are also many problems that have never encountered emergency solution problems that have never encountered the difficulties of ginger. There is a Tibetan class at Jinyuan Senior High School, and the supplies of living materials must be disconnected. The Director of the Gansu Provincial Office of Shanghai and the Communist Party member Kong Lingcheng learned this urgent situation from Bao Yu, Putuo District Education Bureau. : ""Ginger, you have a lot of magical powers, hurry up and help, 100,000 are in a hurry!"" Open a search engine like a computer. With, find President Pei, she has the channel for food and living materials! Docking processing, followed two hours later and questioned: Did the supplies be sent to the school? arrive! We found a unit with a passage of logistics, which is absolutely reliable! There is no trivial matter for people's livelihood. Jiang Jiang said that the follow -up and effectiveness must be implemented, and the style must be too solid at the critical moment. The retired old party member Lao Dai is the chief of the financial section of the ginger unit. In the past two days, he has been a ""big white"" at home. Pudong's epidemic is very heavy, and the epidemic prevention supplies are consumed very large. She watched the ""big white suit"" with light. She sent a WeChat: Secretary Jiang, can he donate a little protective service to our community? Coincidentally, Zheng Lingang, the boss of Suzhou Jialeway Company, went to the phone and commissioned Jiang to purchase a group of protective clothing to donate to the most needed place in Shanghai! He said: ""I am an old party member. At the critical moment, I have to make a force!"" Watching this pair is going to be, Dai Ke calls again: they just arrived in a batch of protective clothing, troubled Secretary Jiang will donate it to donate it. Protective clothing, donate to the most needed place! Old friend Xu Qinming was awarded the honorary title of Outstanding Volunteer in Shanghai. Soon, he sent these protective clothing to Pudong Traffic Police Detachment! Jiang Jiang said that although people are sealed at home, blood is still hot! In just a few days, the anti -epidemic -resistant matchmaker was paired. There are also many things that need to be purchased: 50,000 barrels of instant noodles; office equipment such as computer, printers and other office equipment of Hubei Aid Hospital Hospital; more than 500 elderly diapers of a nursing home ... Nothing is fine, and there are some kinds of various kinds of All kinds of busy gangs: Friend Wang's mother's eyes were accidentally splashed by disinfectant, and Tan Haibo, an ophthalmologist, helped solve it. A company needs to find a large truck and driver; the PLA has customized chips to Wuxi in a certain part of the PLA; 400,000 sets of protection purchased by a certain district obeyed to Shanghai; and so on. All kinds of things that are usually easy to deal with now are very difficult. No matter how difficult it is, you have to find a way! Jiang Jiang said that ""Jiang Leifeng"" is not a single person alone, but a loose combat collective of a group of public welfare volunteers in Shanghai and even China. Their feelings are humble and restrained, and their actions are rigorous and fast. They practice the vows of the year: ""If there is a war, call back.""

One day, he followed his daughter to the supermarket and saw a large cabbage on the shelves at a price of $ 19.80. He has a hard work, which is equivalent to RMB 100. I couldn't help whispering: ""So expensive?"" The daughter heard only one sentence: ""Just eat it."" After three days, I went to the supermarket. This Chinese cabbage was still at $ 13.80. Han Feng glanced at it and paid attention to it. After three days, I went again, this Chinese cabbage was only $ 3. Han Feng said to her daughter, ""Three times, see three different prices."" The daughter asked him, ""What do you mean?"" Han Feng was ready to take a shot. Unexpectedly, the daughter took him. Han Feng looked at her daughter with wide eyes. The daughter said, ""I don't want you to buy this dish, can you?"" He asked, ""Why?"" The daughter asked him: ""How many people are you waiting for this cabbage to reduce the price?"" Han Feng did not respond for a while Essence The daughter continues: ""This is cheap, don't take it up!"" Han Feng was counted by his daughter, a little annoyed in his heart, and his face was a bit embarrassing. My daughter relieved: ""Dad, we are not a person without money. This Chinese cabbage should be given to those who need it more."" After all, it is a cultural and cultivated person. very happy. After returning, Han Feng proudly told the story in Dongyu Boxing Club, Pudong Xinchang Ancient Town. I heard it, I couldn't count it, ""seeing the wisdom and thinking together"", I had to practice it. On March 22, the community suddenly closed. There is a volunteer girl in the kitchen window. The community is going to be closed, and you want to buy something. I went out of the community immediately and bought a little vegetable home opposite. The next day, the nearby lawyer friend Zhao Yuesheng insisted on sending things over. He couldn't hold it enthusiastic. I opened a list. He bought two big bags and sent it to the entrance of the community. , I can only go downstairs to get it. This lawyer friend is an enthusiastic person. In addition to his job, he also serves as the chairman of the Mutual Welfare Foundation. On Thursday, March 31, before Puxi, he called to send things over again. I repeatedly refused, no. He said that his wife had already asked ""Bai Bai"" at the door of my community in advance, and said that he could bring it in. This building is a serious area of the epidemic. Many people are infected. The express materials downstairs are piled up. No one dares to come up. Eight people in the neighborhood committee want to serve thousands of people in the community and two communities next to them. A knight at Room 801 upstairs shot. He put on a protective suit, bravely took the elevator downstairs, and sent the courier items stacked at the gate of Building 4 to each household. On the high -rise building on the 18th floor, a person ran up and down. Someone in the neighborhood committee shot his video. The shirt behind was soaked. Everyone praised him. Some people reminded him to go home to take a bath for disinfection. After a while, Room 1206 said in the group and said: There is a pack of things at the door, which is from Room 206. I knew it was wrong. I went back and said: I can't go out, let alone go to the stairs, let's talk about it. Since then, I never said again. The next day, there were always people calling for help to find things, and I kept silent. Because, these things are less than 200 yuan, but asking an extremely tired volunteer to hold it, it is still a bit of weight. Besides, there are more things, not a bag of me! I can't bear to trouble others. Two days, I saw two information in the group, which was very moved. One to say: I have a sense of guilt now. The second says: I want to pick things with a little bit, and I can't get up too heavy. This is a dependent thinking, thinking for others. Think of the story of a large cabbage that Mr. Han Feng tells. I have been blocked for 12 days to write new things and Australian stories above. I did n’t understand, I did n’t encounter it. Now I know that the disasters of human beings in the book before seeing war and plague were ranked together. There is also a feeling. As far as this building is concerned, some people are standing in their own difficulties and needs to interpret the sealing notice of the community and the building. Property, they have to face the residents of the three buildings of the entire community, and they have the risk and facts of being infected and infected. There are also difficulties. When recruiting volunteers in the building, the young man in Room 202 first registered response, and then many people stood out in the group almost in the group, and carefully looked at the registration list.

The scenes flashed in my mind like a movie, the sea is ruthless, and my loved ones are deep! Most of our brothers and sisters were born in Beijing. Sixth Brother Zuqiang was born on July 24, 1927 in Jingou Hutong, Beijing. He heard that his mother said that he was more difficult to bring when he was a child. Just concentrate on listening to music and don't cry. When he was four or five years old, he had no teacher. As long as he saw and heard the second sister and three sisters playing piano practice music, he could find a small bench alone, step on it to climb on the piano stool, and himself. Think about the practice song played by two sisters. The two sisters were very surprised and accepted him.

Nanjing was in danger. His father was dismissed by his work unit and only issued a dismissal fee of 80 yuan. His father was unwilling to be a slave of the country. After a lot of danger, he finally reached Chongqing at the time. In Chongqing, he experienced the furious day and night of Japanese planes. For the safety of the family, his father arranged for the national drama of the national drama where he was studying with his mother to work with his mother to work with his mother. In this way, you do n’t have to be scared. You do n’t need to hide the plane bombing every day, drill the anti -air cave, and live a more stable life for more than a year. In the old residence of Jiang'an, Zu Qiang and his elder brother Zuguang, who were senior in elementary school, lived in a house. The elder brother was creating the drama ""The Song of the Qi"", writing a night car to write, and the next day, Zu Qiang helped him with the draft. The National Drama Troupe performed drama often requires small actors. Our brothers and sisters have become their ""special invitation"" objects. Zu Qiang was ""specially invited"" to perform Zhang Junxiang's drama ""The Little Master of the Rose"" in the drama of Li Jianwu. "" The barking Huazi in the Fengxue Night ""; the seven sister Wu Yan played the palace girl in"" History of the Qing Dynasty "", and the little eighth sister Wu Chu played a little princess in the"" President of the United States ""directed by Zhang Junxiang. I was also invited Ding Weimin's son in the solo drama ""Killing the enemy"" in the fifth graduation performance of the play college. When Zu Qiang performed ""Act"", he was very interested. According to the characters in the play, he found the old cloth head. Nine small cloths were sewn. Putting the bed in the room of Six 7 as a stage, put on paper stacked tables, stools and other symbolic props. While chanting the lines in the drama, he took the small cloth people to make various actions with his hands. The three -scene drama showed us to watch without leakage, which is very exciting. The sixth brother is really versatile. He likes music, has literary talents, can write articles, can engrav (stone carvings, bamboo carvings), and can also act ... but he loves music the most. When I was in school in Chongqing and Nanjing, I always arranged time to practice piano in Yucai School of Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Under the teachings of musician Zhang Dinghe and Sheng Jialun, I often performed solo on the stage in school. song. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the National Conservatory of Music, and then transferred to the Central Conservatory of Music. After graduation, he stayed in school to teach. Fortunately, he was selected to study before the Soviet Union. During studying abroad, he created ""C major string quadrilateral"". At that time, the Conomedas Quartet, which was composed of four professors of Moscow Conservatory of Music, recorded it at the Soviet National Broadcasting Station. What a glory for an international student! In 1958, Zu Qiang graduated with his excellent results and returned to teach at the Beijing Central Conservatory of Music. He did not live up to the cultivation of the party and the country. For more than sixty years, no matter whether he has been in teaching or a leader position, or the busy social activities, he has not relaxed the music teaching of music talents and cultivated a large number of international musicians. He abandoned the senior official Hou Lu and rushed to the cause of music and culture. He knows the world's contributions to the music culture. For example, the musicians of the ballet drama ""Fish Beauty"" and ""Red Lady Army"" are well -known; Combined with the technique of Western Symphony to create a large number of works, such as the string ensemble ""Erquan Yueyue"", the pipa concerto ""Grassland Heroes"", and ""Spring River Flower Moon Night"", ""Listening to Songsong Night"" """" Liang Xiao ""and so on. He also wrote dubbing music for many movies and dramas, such as ""Twelve Train"", ""Zhan Tianyou"", ""Yang Kaihui"", ""Resurrection"", ""Fisher's Wedding"", ""Snowy Night"" and so on. He has served as a member of the CPPCC of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for five or 20 years. He used this platform to do a lot of work for the prosperity of the motherland's music and culture. For example: he has led more than ten proposals for the creation of the National Theater. In 2007, the National Grand Theater was completed, and he was also hired as the director of the National Grand Theater Art Committee, which continued to contribute to the prosperity of the national music culture and art cause. Sixth Brother Zuqiang was very concerned about our brothers and sisters. At the end of 1948, he took me and Xiaobai to ""liberate"" to Shanghai and other. After the liberation in 1949, he also took me to the city's North Middle School to sign up for high school. In 1964, he was responsible for the overall design of the ballet ""Red Lady Army"" music. He led the team to Hainan Island to ""collect the wind"", detour Shanghai when he returned, and visited my family and relatives and relatives of his father -in -law and his father -in -law. Porcelain deer and a white coral, I have been collecting in the decorative cabinet at home. At that time, he slept on a small bed in a one -bedroom in my house for a few nights. After crushing the ""Gang of Four"", I was transferred to a ""Cultural Revolution"" in the ""Cultural Revolution"" as the principal who was destroyed very well. In 1982, in 1982, to rectify the school style, strengthen campus culture construction, and launched the activity of ""recalling school history, writing school songs"" activities. , I summarized everyone's opinions, wrote the first draft, and asked Liu Brother to compose. He was very busy, but he still squeezed the time to modify the lyrics and compose the lyrics, and finally played and sang to his family. Everyone expressed his satisfaction to complete it. He wrote to me, and suggested that the author named ""Lu Chang"". He walked Lu, and I was named Chang. Don't use the real name. However, the school committee couldn't understand it, but still used the real name. Through the education of school history and school songs, the students of our school have been greatly encouraged. The school's appearance has changed a lot. In 1985, the school was rated as an advanced unit of Putonghua in the country. ,rest in peace!

Space,Love without roots,Space,"Luo Yuming Qin Keqing's brother Qin Zhong, and Jia Baoyu is a pair of young friends. The fifteenth and sixteen times of ""Dream of Red Mansions"", mixed with other contents, wrote Qin Zhong's love and death -a sad and meditating story. At the beginning, Wang Xifeng helped Jia Zhen to operate Qin Keqing's funeral instrument, and lived in Shuiyueyue on the day of the big day. In the evening, the aunt of the net deficiency came over to pull a transaction with Sister Feng, and Baoyu and Qin Zhong, who came with Sister Feng, played in the Buddhist temple. After a while, Xiao Ni was smart, and Baoyu laughed and said, ""Can you come."" Qin Zhong said, ""What do you do?"" It sounds like the tone of the two people is different. Baoyu called Xiao Ni ""in power"" and had a good tone; Qin Zhong called her ""that thing"", as if she had nothing to do with herself, and was a bit contempt. But he is a guilty conscience and concealed himself. Baoyu laughed at him when he pretended to be fine: ""Don't get ghosts! In the old lady's house that day, there is no one, what do you do with him? The storyline that happened before. The smart child walked with Master in Rongfu since he was a child. She gradually grew up. The so -called love sinus opened, and when she saw Qin Zhongjun's elegant and elegant, she liked it; although smart is a nun, she looks beautiful and charming. Qin Zhong also loves her very much. Although the two were not very good, they had a good intention and understood in their hearts. Therefore, Baoyu and Qin Zhong played in the Buddhist temple. Smart running over is not unintentional. Baoyu revealed the truth, and then blackmailed: ""Is there any or not, you just told him to pour a bowl of tea for me, so you can do it."" Why do you want to say a bowl of tea? Baoyu also explained: ""I told him to fall down, and it was not as good as you called him."" There is no affectionate tea, and it is rare in the people with affection. It's not tea, but affection; the aunt of the nun is not affectionate to me, so I will stick to you and borrow it. Smart poured tea. Qin Zhong said with a smile: ""Give me."" Baoyu also called: ""Give me."" Smart Er pouted and laughed: ""A bowl of tea is also fighting, is there a honey in my hand!"" Boys are fighting for diligence, a happy response, and talking between a girl's unique innocence and pride. Between boys and girls, if there are some emotions, if there is nothing, it seems that it is soft, it is very soft, it is beautiful, and it is also charming. Baoyu was satisfied with the bowl of tea, but Qin Zhong wanted more. When there was no one in the dark, he went to the back room to look for smart children, and begged her to ""good sister"", and wanted to be good with smart children. Smart said: ""What are you going to do, unless I am out of this pit, it is better to leave these people."" This means that she is also willing to be together. But she had to escape from this pit. Only by leaving these people can she find a home! Is it possible to be a nun forever and sneak with you? The novel does not explain the family's family. But we can know from the storyline: she has no home in Beijing, and there is no place to be able to vote. She may be an orphan, maybe the poor can not live, and give it to the old nun as an apprentice and a commissioner. Anyway, it is not her wish to be a nun. But she called Shui Yuezhang's place as ""pits"". In addition to yearning for worldly life, her master, the old and sly clenched old nun, the feeling of her giant, was also very bad to her feelings. This can be imagined. If you want me, you take me away. This is the wish of intelligence. How did Qin Zhong answer? He said, ""This is also easy, but‘ far water can not be neat thirst ’.” He was unwilling to wait, and said with a bite, the room was dark, and the smart child was hugged on the cymbal. At this time, Baoyu did not know how to break in and scattered a pair of wild puppets. Smart children are still young, maybe Baoyu feels that it is not appropriate. At that time, Qin Zhong was about thirteen years old, and his intelligence was smaller. They love each other is a kind of natural feelings for young people. They are ignorant, panic, and have no reliable foundation, and there is no exact plan; behind this, more importantly, they have not controlled their own destiny. Qin Zhong is an official child. How can his father allow him to be with a nun? It is almost difficult for him to rescue the intelligence pit. But he said, ""It's easy."" This is obviously to say a word in order to greet the happiness in front of me. Although it is not deceived, there is really no serious thinking. When young people love each other, not only lacks restraint and calculations, it is also vague about the understanding of danger. Xiao Ni Aunt Smart is an infatuated and bold girl. After Qin Zhong left Shuiyueyu and returned to Beijing, she thought about it day and night, and finally disregarded everything and ran out of the city. Found. This is okay! From the perspective of the old man, this is simply ridiculous and unpredictable. In a furious, he not only drove away his intelligence, but also hit Qin Zhong's pain. These are all of them. Qin Ye was a child in his old age. At this time, he was in his 70s. He was old and weak, and he was anxious and anxious. The old illness recurred. After three or five days, he died. Qin Zhong was weak, and he had a pain with illness, and his body was even worse. His personality was also weak. He saw his father who was alive and died for his fault. He regretted himself and blamed himself. The condition worsened every day and finally came to an end. On this day Baoyu rushed to Qin Mansion when he heard the news, Qin Zhong had fainted several times. Qin Keqing and Qin Ye have died first. There are only a few alienated relatives in the Qin family who are taking care of him. They have carried Qin Zhong from the cymbal on a board bed to clean up the funeral. Unexpectedly, Qin Zhong had only a breath, and when he heard Baoyu's cry, he woke up again. The novel was written in Qin Zhong before his death, and it was bitter to read. The first is that smart children have no whereabouts. In order to pursue the happiness of the world, this beautiful and bold nun escaped from the ""pit"" she said. The world is vast, and she is young and ignorant. What kind of pits are waiting for her? This made Qin Zhong think of death. The second is the three or four thousand silver of the father left by his father. Bai Xianyong's book believes that Qin Zhong is about to die, and it is unreasonable to remember those silver. Mr. Bai said that ""Dream of Red Mansions"" is the opposite of Zhang Ailing everywhere, and many of his views are strange. Qin Ye is a poor official. Three or four thousand silver is the entire property of this family. I do n’t know how to reduce the province to save it. But the people of the Qin family died, and this money could only be left to the farm relatives who had nothing to do with it. The third is regretting a lifetime. At that time, Baoyu asked him: ""What are the words left two sentences."" Qin Zhong said: ""There is no other word. In the past, you and I knew that he was more than the world, and I only learned about it today. That's right. ""After speaking, I left people. How to understand Qin Zhong's passage, this end of this life entrustment? He and Baoyu are good friends; they both have a rebellious spirit and look down on the vulgar people who pursue fame and fortune; and they all think that their knowledge is higher than the world. However, their rebellion is blind, without a real social foundation, and on the road of rebellion, they don't even have basic survivability. The love between the teenagers between Qin Zhong and Smart is originally beautiful, but it cannot be visible to society, so it cannot be seen to the parents. As a result, he killed intelligence, himself, and killed his old father! Before he died, he warned Baoyu with his own tragedy: We had no power on the road of rebellion. Qin Zhong's fate is also the epitome of Baoyu's fate. His story and his regrets are deep in ""Dream of Red Mansions"".",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-20/7.htm,4/20/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,

Space,"""After the 95th"" I have become a good helper for the old people of the cabin",Space,"I am a ""post -95"" employee of the Shanghai Huai Opera Troupe. At 3 am on April 7, I received a call from the Center for Disease Control. Instant, get on, enter the cabin ... a series of steps caught me off guard. When I recorded my personal information, the medical staff asked me if I could help the aunt next door. She was a migrant worker who came to Shanghai and almost did not know the text on the detection software. Each nucleic acid detection was a companion to complete the registration. ""This is the whole, what's the word ..."" Aunt kept asking ""Dabai"". I readily agreed and used my mobile phone to help the aunt's entry information. The aunt thanked her. Since I have the first ""appreciating my audience"", my ""square cabin life"" seems to have opened the door of the new world. I have encountered the old Grandpa who only used the elderly machine, the mother of the two children, and the mother of the two children. The minority compatriots who only have a little Mandarin ... After a round of entry, the medical staff asked with a smile and asked me if I should be the ""layer"" on this layer. ""Of course there is no problem!"" In this way, I, an ordinary ""post -95s"", took up the logistics support work on the floor: knocking from house to the door while eating; the ""neighbors"" who could not operate mobile phones when doing nucleic acids solved the trouble. ; Recording, feedback, follow -up, and implementing the materials needed by the people around you ... In the days of the square hospital, I have a few positions to transform the technical maintenance workers, civil mediators, food issuers, psychological counselors; solve the solution The problem of blocking the sewer, the disappearance of the mobile phone signal, helping the elderly to dispatch anxiety, and telling the roommates with cold jokes to relieve uneasiness. The busy and fulfilling life completely calmed down my bad emotions. Whenever I received the thanks of the ""neighbors"", I felt that I was worthy of relying on people. These happiness was a ordinary person in ordinary people living in ordinary people. Never before. This is a very complicated emotion, mixed with movement, sympathy, and intertwined with a sense of accomplishment, honor, and pride, making me truly happy. One afternoon, a granddaughter's rushing greeting greeted me back to reality from a nap. Grandma was excited and frustrated repeatedly that the mobile phone was broken, and she couldn't talk to her son anymore. I took the mobile phone and disposable gloves from Grandma, and she repeatedly explained that the gloves were borrowed next door. It was very clean. The phone had just been poisoned. I studied my phone for a long time. To be honest, the moment I took the phone, I had no confidence to repair it, but Grandma was full of confidence in me. When I fixed my phone, when I returned to Zhao, the grandmother gave me a thumbs up: ""Oh, our little beauty is really a stick! I will repair everything!"" Later, the grandma said my ""glorious deeds"", After dinner, the whole floor knew that I restored a ""brick"" into a mobile phone! I was embarrassed to respond to the kindness of everyone's goodwill, returned to the room, and ate the cookies that the grandma stuffed to me when I was leaving. It was not big, very sweet ... In this way, the life of the square cabin continued smoothly and in an orderly manner. Go down. That night, I do n’t know which community to unblock the cheers. The shouts spread to my ear with a whistle. After a while, I heard someone downstairs responded. It was echoing for a while. I shouted ""Come on"" with a mask. The sporadic words were gone into the night, and the waves were shocked, and more and more people joined it.

Space,Why is this foreigner who is a volunteer?,"""I have benefited from my work in China, and now I want to give back to this country""","""Hello, this is your entry and exit certificate. One household is limited to one person once a day. Thank you for your cooperation."" Recently, in Dongming Huayuan Community, Fangsong Street, Songjiang District, Songjiang District, which is classified as a prevention area, many residents encountered a foreign country. Volunteers come to the door to preach control measures. He wore a volunteer vest and spoke a less standard Mandarin. This is the Dutch person in China for 30 years in China Jacob von Bestfield. He also has Chinese name -Luo Jiangqiang, and him Community volunteers who resist the diseases on the shoulder like to call him ""Lao Luo"". The following is the self -report of Lao Luo -after Puxi sealing control on April 1, I decided to prevent and control volunteers. A enthusiastic Communist Party member quickly got the application form. After coordinating, I was appointed foreign volunteers responsible for translation services, and then got the isolation clothes, gloves, masks, face screens, and volunteers vest. There are more than 2,500 residents I live in. On the first day and fourth day of the sealing control, I participated in maintaining the sampling order of nucleic acid and guided residents to maintain a safe distance. More often, I participated in the registration of the personnel of the building to ensure that the residents of specific buildings went downstairs for sampling. Everyone uses social media extensively. The leader of the building will remind related matters through the WeChat group. During the sealing period, Shanghai provided basic living materials for each residents for free. Thousands of food parcels were transported from trucks from all over China. The distribution of these materials was definitely a huge challenge for community workers. In Dongming Huayuan Community, volunteers have not stopped at all times. For the infant milk powder, medicines and other items purchased by residents, we will use various transportation tools including baggage cars, electric bicycles, and send them to the corresponding building. The clearing of garbage here forms a safe and effective process. The neighborhood committee requires that each residents will be divided into dry and humid waste bags at the door at 7 am to 8 am. I and other volunteers and I worn their disposable isolation clothes, wear gloves and masks, compact the garbage box, send it to the designated garbage point, and then collected by the Sanitation Department of Songjiang District. After completion, the isolation clothes, gloves and masks worn by volunteers are treated as medical waste. Of course, the key to curbing viruses such as Omiko strains, the key is to minimize contact between people, but this is difficult, because humans themselves like to live in groups. Therefore, volunteers and I need to patrol at night in the community to prevent residents from going out in violation of regulations, but actual observations have found that there are very few situations. Maybe someone would ask, what caused foreigners like me to come out as volunteers? My opinion is a natural sense of responsibility for most foreigners. I realize that virus transmission may be paralyzed with basic public services and endangers the lives of more people. Some of the foreign friends in China believe that they are willing to stay in China and live well in China. We benefit from China's work, hoping to participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic and give back to this country. Moreover, volunteer services can also truly understand locals, such as the way they solve problems and how to deal with interpersonal relationships. In my community, most young volunteers are Communists. From them, I can feel the spirit of the Long March -not afraid of any difficulties, and unite closely.

Space,Lie Ghost to eat tofu,Space,"After Chen Shixu lived in Guangzhou, I heard a sentence describing a person's savvy saying: ""Do you uh ghost tofu?"" Among them, ""uh"" is ""cheating""; : ""Do you lie to ghosts to eat tofu?"" The source of this sentence is a folklore: a long time ago, there was a scholar, super smart, and even ghosts could cheat. One night, a villain arrived in his house and wanted to eat him. He said, ""You want to eat me? The door is too (no problem), but I have a cold day, the flesh is sour and smelly, and it is good to eat. The meat is much more fresh. ""Ghost Xin thought it was true. The scholar ran away with ghosts eating tofu. This story reminds me of an old colleague from his hometown. He has a good mind, fast response, talks and rushing, and walks. Later, he became a leader and made a report without a manuscript. Knowing the world, the decision of killing and killing, he couldn't hide anything, and no one could confuse him. Many years have passed. Last year, I returned to my hometown because of family affairs. When I met the son of this old colleague, I told me very sadly that his father went into the demon! Most of the salary of salary every month to various ""health care companies"", ""health seminars"" and ""lectures on life and technology"", and replace it back to Linlin can detoxify, beauty, anti -cancer, anti -aging, prevent all diseases, and longevity. Bowl pans, clothing, bedding, solid liquid ... large bags and small bags, long boxes and short boxes, piled up the home without pouring. He was busy living in and out of the place every day, concentrated on his will, and he was not tired of this. As a result, his son had to ""respect"" his ""salesman"" and ""invite"" his ""new acquaintance"" from time to time to come to the door from time to time. But noisy, noisy, scolding, and beating, everything was not available, and it was still the same. There are often reports of criminals on the media. Some deception methods are not clever, but it is so easy to be fooled. The phenomenon of ""deception"" is wandering in cities, villages, enterprises, schools, and even many unexpected places. Scholars and experts have done in -depth research on this aspects of sociology, psychology, biology, legal science, and medicine. The publicity of various media such as television is vigilant, self -protection, and absolutely not allowed criminals to be organic, and so on. These are naturally not effective, but it is still difficult to prevent deception. Especially attention is the elderly group. Compared with other people, they seem to be more and more likely to be deceived. The reason for the simple summary is that the degree of trust increases with age, the cognitive power is declining with age; lack of care for love , Lack of protection and reminders of children and loved ones, and so on. In addition, fraud, the deception is similar. Faced with cunning liar, they often make the following mistakes: 1. Self -deceive. Although doubtful, facing the temptation of interests, trying to persuade yourself, how to see the other person is not like a liar; second, luck. Maybe I feel that the other party has a trick, but there are somewhat handles in their hands, such as deposit and hostages, but they have won the scammers' double reeds and serial bureau; ""Three people become tigers"", listening to the wind is rain; 4. I think it is a big cheap, but it is the liar's bait; 5. I think celebrities and authority must be better than themselves; 6. ""Compatriots"", ""colleagues"", ""fellow villagers"" and ""acquaintances"" are not guarded; seven, always feel that at least one percent of hopes, but not knowing one of the scammers one by one percent; 8. Knowing that there is no free lunch in the world, But I still can't stop accepting hints. However, all of the above are not my old colleague. In the year of 生, he was still angry, his thinking was clear, and his actions were agile. Although his wife has already been sick, his children are successful, family harmony, take care of him, and respect him. His son talked to me for a long time that day, and he was puzzled. I pondered for a long time and said: There is only one reason, that is, his old man has a smooth and rainy life, and has almost no setbacks, forming absolute self -confidence, and he will never make mistakes. He can deceive the ghosts to eat tofu. Essence Such self -confidence is actually a cognitive defect, a kind of irreparable stupidity. The so -called stupidity is just unreasonable, regardless of the blue and red soap -based on politeness, I did not say this sentence. Those who can cheat ghosts can only be legendary, and in reality, they do not exist in reality. In this sense, the biggest scammers are actually in their own hearts.

Space,I want Li Bai to see ...,Space,"Although Zhu Yuan's dance drama ""Never Passing the Rods"" is known as the phenomenon -level dance drama ""The Radio Wave"" has performed more than 400 games. Although the poster of Wang Jiajun, who played Li Xia in the play, was covered with the streets and alleys, wearing masks and protective clothing He was not recognized by a dance fan until three days later. It was not accurate to say that in fact, the residents saw the names written behind him, so they paid attention to the half -faced face, which was confirmed. Asked if he would have an idol baggage, Wang Jiajun said with a smile: ""I can't be busy, what burdens are not burdensome. Daily use of medicines, stare at nucleic acids, and send vegetables. This time The stage looks beautiful and fresh, but in fact, the life of the dancer is very simple. Usually two o'clock, either home or dance group rehearsal hall. Because of the hot performance and tour of the ""radio waves"", Wang Jiajun for two or three years in a row, and it took only a few months to stay in Shanghai. Most of the time, his eyes opened and he had to be stunned for a while before he could think of which city in. In order to get close to the dance group, his parents bought a small house for his old district on Shuicheng Road. With this round of epidemic prevention and control, he has been isolated in this community for more than half a month. ""Really, I have lived here for so many years, and the neighbors who have known each other have not been these half a month."" On April 1st, Shanghai Puxi Sea Control, on March 31, Wang Jiajun signed up for community volunteers. ""We Most of the communities in this community are the husband's house on the sixth floor. The community is very aging. Many of them are grandparents and grandma who have come to a house before. They were inconvenient to go up and down. . We should naturally stand up for the few young people and provide some help. ""Volunteers have complicated work. Wang Jiajun is not afraid of suffering or tired, so he is afraid of getting the elderly:"" A large part of the elderly in residents will not be too much. With a smartphone, it will not be as sensitive as young people's mobile phone information, so they shouted from holding a big horn to knocking from house to house, and then explained and communicated with many elderly people who do not want to go down. Sort out and let the elderly stand for a long time. ""Fortunately, after a day or two"" exercises "", the detection of nucleic acid was carried out in an orderly manner. To this day, Wang Jiajun has been serving in the community for more than ten days, and almost all volunteer positions have been taken. Whether you go to the hospital to distribute the medicine or ""snap up"" the pharmacy; whether it is escorting the last 200 meters of transportation, or to throw garbage in the controlling building, Wang Jiajun said that the most tiring position is the position of auxiliary nucleic acid detection. ""Help nucleic acid detection, usually go to the job to prepare for the job one hour before the medical care. Usually the detection starts at 7 am. Then we will start to set up a shed and set the table to prepare disinfection and detection sticks. Tags for the tube stickers, and also ensure that the code sweepper can operate normally. Basically, it takes six or seven hours in one stop. ""And originally thought, helping volunteers can move the body of the home home. It disappeared after putting on a protective clothing, wearing a mask and a protective mask. The protective clothing is particularly stuffy. Wearing not only is restrained by hands and feet, it is difficult to breathe for a long time, let alone stretch your body. The physical labor such as carrying rice and moving vegetable bags does not exercise muscles, because the way of exerting force is different. So usually watching hard work for a day, he must massage his muscles first, then switch his body to the dance channel, and re -training and basic dance training. Of course, such a valuable experience also allowed the preparatory party member Wang Jiajun to gain an unprecedented life experience. In his own words: ""This time, it is really integrated into the masses and feels it down to the earth. The work of Moon Volunteer gave him a deeper understanding of the community and neighbors. ""Urgent others and want others to think"" also made him fall into the human fireworks. ""I think this (paragraph experience) will be In the future, a valuable wealth will be closer to the life itself whether it is a story in dance or shaping the role on the stage. """" Radio waves ""have performed hundreds of games, and Wang Jiajun performed on the stage countless times. For the prototype, he said in an interview: ""Every time he plays, he will feel that he is closer to Li Bai, and he can understand his choice and sacrifice better."" From time to time, he remembered the hero he played over and over again. ""Because of their dedication, we don't have to face such a cruel struggle, but we also want them to see that today we can also work together Watch the help.

Space ,The correct way to open the home environment ,Space ,"Disinfection in time and effectively is an important part of the epidemic prevention and control. Recently, Shanghai is carrying out environmental cleaning and disinfecting operations in public areas. For park green spaces, roads, sidewalks, etc., relevant departments and districts have continued to carry out disinfecting operations. It has now eliminated 6,444 green land and cleared 1308 blind spots. In addition to the cleaning and disinfecting of the environment in the public areas, doing a good job of cleaning work and proper sterilization and disinfection have also become a compulsory course for many friends to live in epidemic prevention. So, how to correctly disinfect home and environment? What disinfection methods are wrong? Environmental improvement work, the Office of the Municipal Patriotic Health Sports Committee, the Municipal Health Promotion Center, and the Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Center answered the 10 disinfection questions that citizens care about, and also sorted out 8 points for the correct disinfection. Q: How to disinfect the items in the home? Answer: Commonly used small items such as mobile phones, remote controls, mouses, door handles, faucet, various buttons, etc. 70%-80%alcohol cotton balls or disinfected wet towels can be used to wipe and disinfect. Large -scale objects such as desktops and ground can be sprayed, wiped or dragged for disinfection with disinfectant with 500 mg/L with effective chlorine (bromine) 500 mg/L. We clothes, bedding and other fabrics can be exposed to the sun, and generally do not use special disinfection. Washing pools and toilets can be used for disinfection with chlorine -containing disinfection. The first choice of tableware is the first choice for boiling and disinfection for 15-30 minutes, or for 30 minutes circulating steam, or the tableware disinfection cabinet can be operated according to the instructions. You can also use 20-500 mg/L to soak for 30 minutes after soaking the chlorine (bromine) disinfection solution, and then wash it with water. When disinfection in circulation, there should be a gap in the placement of the tableware, and it must not be placed closely to avoid affecting the disinfection effect. It should be ensured that the tableware should be completely immersed. Do not increase the dosage of disinfection at home at home, especially do not pour disinfection and vote for disinfection tablets at will. Q: How to disinfect group purchase and express packages? Answer: When picking up the goods, wear a mask, gloves, and take a non -contact receipt. The outer packaging of the item can be sprayed with disinfectant or disinfected wet towels, and it can be placed for 10-30 minutes. Carton boxes, packaging bags, etc. should be left out of the door as much as possible and put in the trash. Fresh foods can be rinsed or soaked, dry, and dry. After the processing is completed, use ""soap/hand -sanitrigo + flowing water"" in time to clean your hands by ""seven -step washing method"". Q: How to disinfect vegetables and fruits? Answer: It is not easy to dehydrate and deteriorate (potatoes, radishes, onions, apples, etc.), which can be placed on the balcony for some time. Easy to dehydrate, deteriorate vegetables (greens, garlic seedlings, bean sprouts, etc.), can be rinsed, soaked and washed slowly, and storage is drained. Generally speaking, the outer packaging of vegetables and fruits can spray disinfection agents to reduce risks. For the fruits and vegetables itself, they only need to clean them. Do not use chemical disinfectants to disinfect to avoid affecting food safety and taste. If there is a disinfection, the disinfectant with fruits and fruits can be used. According to the concentration on the instructions, soak for 10-30 minutes, and rinse the residual disinfection with water. Q: Can I spray clothes with a disinfectant? Answer: Under normal circumstances, the probability of personal coats carrying new coronary viruses is less likely; secondly, chemical disinfection plants such as pedestrian disinfection channels are directly sprayed on the human body, because the spraying time is too short, and the amount of spray is too small. No disinfection effect. Q: Can the disinfectant spray air? Answer: The positive probability of outdoor air virus is minimal.

Space,Another spring,Space,"Wu Shuangchun is a season that people like, because of her beauty. I also like spring. The air that breathe has become less cold. There is no need to surround the thick scarf on the neck. The mask becomes humid because the breathing will become wet, which is the result of rising temperature. Walking on the road, you will obviously feel that there is a trace of sweetness in the air, and there will be a feeling of being blown by the wind on the forehead. It's the so -called spring breeze. Those who have experienced the cold winter will be grateful for everything in spring, so all the deepest praise in the world will become the gorgeous clothes of spring. But is spring really perfect? I think of a plot in ""A Dream of Red Mansions"": one in the early spring, a little girl said to another little girl, how can you be so frowning? Is it sick? I heard people say that people are willing to be sick in the spring. If you do n’t go to ask Miss Lin, there are many medicines, and you go to eat with her. Another girl said, go! A medicine is also mixed? In fact, I ca n’t remember the specific plot, but I remember the phrase “the people are willing to be sick in the spring”, because it was a brand new common sense for me when I was a kid. When I first read ""Dream of Red Mansions"", I was only about ten years old. When I saw the little girl's mouth, I felt very fresh. Oh, when the spring arrives, people with old aging diseases will be sick. Perhaps this is the so -called ""recovery of all things"". What everything refers to things is not just a new positive thing, but also something on the other, such as egg bugs, such as diseases, such as bacteria, viruses, etc. That happened when I felt troublesome and uncomfortable. During the Spring Festival, I bought two fashionable thin sweater, and happily worn on my body, replacing it with the old, and I was comfortable. Who knew that two days later, I felt itchy, and I took off my sweater at night and found that a lot of red dots emerged on the two arms, and suddenly realized that there was a problem with the newly bought sweater. how could be? The sweater is new and bought in a serious mall, is it because of my allergies? But such a large area of allergies have not happened for many years. I had to take off my sweater. I washed it a few times and soaked with a laundry solution and a soft agent. After drying it, I still dared not wear it again. I wanted to throw it away. Looking at the unique color and style, I was unwilling. I had to press several fragrant insect -proof cakes into the wardrobe, and I didn't dare to touch it again. Coincidentally. A few days ago, the sewer of the kitchen suddenly didn't fall into the water. When I was a child, Feng Feng shouted and shouted me: Sister! Come and see! I washed the bowl, and suddenly the foam came from under the pool cabinet! I ran to see, the sewer was blocked, and the dishwashing liquid was full of the kitchen. Quickly let her turn off the water pipe, don't move the pool first. I hurriedly found a bottle of ""pipelines"", a layer of gray soil was covered, and the gray soil was carefully and looked at it. It expired two years ago. I hurriedly ran to the hardware supplies store outside the two streets to buy back a bottle of pipeline to come back. Sprinkle a lot of water in the pool cabinet. Lying on the ground to observe the water flow, and holding his sleeves and stretching his arms into the position of the floor drain to explore the situation, making my head, arms, hands, and pants legs sticking with black and sticky dirty things. The sewage pipe is made. You said, how can the water pipe be blocked for a long time, why is it blocked at this time? Is it because the temperature has risen and thermal expansion and contraction, causing the accumulation of the pipeline to make a break? Just a few days after stopping, there was a problem with my cat. The 14 -year -old cat Dabai, who was often exposed on my Douyin live broadcast and was quite popular, suddenly made a skin disease. It always uses his mouth to stab its own hair, especially on both sides and back of the body, and later developed on the stomach. At the beginning, I sorted it with a comb, thinking that it was a general discomfort. Later, I felt wrong. The white dander fell down. Do you have dermatitis or cat ringworm? Take out the cat bag, stuff the big white in, and take it to the pet hospital. Do a skin test and a blood test. The doctor said: Allergic dermatitis. For a few days, I took an injection, took medicine, rubbed the medicine, and soaked in. Finally, I saw Dabai quiet, no longer scratching my hair with my mouth, my mood was not restless, and the living state returned to normal. Spring is here, the ice and snow fades, the hard land begins to be soft, the temperature rises, the ground is heating, the green grass germinated, and the spring flower peach blossoms bloom. But don't forget that maggots also began to move, and various bacteria also entered the rhythm of reproduction. The birth of a new life must be accompanied by the existence of another negative thing. This is the law that the world we survive. The other side of life was dead, and behind the survival was dying. We should not be as pessimistic as Lin Daiyu. She is a person who is scattered and uncomfortable, because she cannot tolerate separation and loss. Yes, it is not long in spring and summer, and it will come in autumn and winter. But I also remember another famous saying: Winter is here, will spring be far away? My family is good, and I have recovered. But this morning, the neighbors told me that her cat buns were sick, the urinary system was infected, and she was hospitalized.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-22/8.htm,4/22/22,8th Edition: Nights Cup,

Until this period of control, one day the company's morning meeting, beauty colleagues shared her recently because she was a milk dealer at home, helped friends around her to buy milk, and also met a lot of neighbors. This was the beginning. My husband has the habit of drinking fresh milk for a long time. Colleagues do not want to make black money, and the fresh milk supplied is cheaper than the supermarket. So I shouted in the resident group, did anyone want to buy milk together? Unexpectedly, the response was extremely enthusiastic, and I made ten boxes at once. The next morning, less than seven o'clock, the milk arrived, and no one responded in the group. The two of them and the two of them sent milk from house to house and put it at the door without contact. The neighbors drank the cheap and delicious milk, and they gave it to thank you, and everyone interacted in the group. Some elderly people say that they can't buy anything. What should I do if my family is about to break food? I responded, it doesn't matter, I have it, I give you some; some people have no toilet paper, no oil, and less rice and less seasonings. I found that neighbors would take the initiative to help and share it. In the process of interaction, we found that more than a dozen elderly people lived alone, or their children could not pass in other communities. The old people would not buy vegetables with mobile phones. Volunteers have built a list of elderly care. I claimed that six elderly people who lived alone or children were not around, built a small group, and every time I bought food, I would ask in the small group. purchase? Buy it well and help them send them to the door. It's just a small movement, which is the work of holding hands, but they get a lot of thanks and feedback. There is a particularly enthusiastic man in the resident group. He has rich resources. He has helped everyone a few times of vegetables, meat and rice, and some frozen foods. In addition to milk, I can help docking. Others can do as volunteers, help carry and distribute materials, and help the elderly who help the neighborhood committees to provide meals. The demand of residents can be responded in time, and with sufficient material guarantee, she can resist the disease at home. Today is the 21st day of the closure of the community. Although he was more distressed in the epidemic, he unexpectedly received the rapid heating up the neighborhood relationship. The story of a simple and beautiful society in the early days, helping each other to cross the difficulty, always happened at all times, and it feels very warm. Starting from a bottle of fresh milk, I opened the interaction between my neighbors. I often send small things at the door: a pack of spices, a burger, a toast bread with a bottle jam ... Give ginseng tea, a box of eggs, a pack of rice, the younger sister will help me grabbing takeaway ... When I know what other people need, they will be transferred to people who need help than me, especially older. resident. I have to go to work every morning and afternoon. At the same time, I have to answer the questions of many residents, especially the elderly, and sometimes I am busy until I eat a meal at night. I feel tired. Helping others is the foundation of happiness, and the feedback obtained is priceless. After all, this epidemic will pass, but I believe that the Shanghai people who have passed the difficulties will always remember the warm time of this neighborhood. I am a Taiwan compatriot. My parents and my parents are from the mainland. They were originally a family. Six years ago, I followed my husband to work in Shanghai and was helped by neighbors on the same floor. Now I can give back to me a little power. Shanghai is facing unprecedented challenges. If everyone can do a little more, this society will get better and better. I found the same story that repeatedly happened in each community. I am very happy at this time I am in Shanghai and move forward with everyone. My name is 806 little king. I will never forget the deep feelings brought to me during this time. Wang Yan",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-23/7.htm,4/23/22,No. 7 Edition: Shanghai News,
Space,"Little Orange ""Medicine Shop""",Space,"Lao Zhou Xiaozi is a new Shanghai native. She and her husband were born in 1993 and have been in Shanghai from Sichuan for less than three years. Living into the community is only about a year. Little Orange is her WeChat name. She has a brother with a word ""orange"" in the name, and she likes to eat oranges, so she takes her WeChat name as ""Little Orange"". During the epidemic, Little Orange became a red man in the community. The two couples were originally learned to design. In recent years, they have made a lot of pharmacy design and decoration, so they are familiar with a pharmacy in the surrounding area. Knowing that the elderly in the community went out to distribute medicine, the neighborhood committee was difficult to solve it for a while. Little Orange tried to contact the pharmacies and volunteered to go out for the residents of the community. A group of little oranges, huh, come in hundreds of people. Everyone's drug needs are really: there are basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension, some who want to alcohol and thermometer, some Chinese medicines such as the flowers of the flowers, and the antigen reagent ... In short, there are eight flowers. Little oranges usually go to the goods once a week. Before entering the medicine, the little oranges have to check the information repeatedly, and there are several large pieces of paper under densely. Medicine is a big deal, you can't make mistakes. She did not hurry to collect money, but packed first, and padded in more than 20,000 yuan once. Buy good medicine, find car transportation, find someone to move. That day, the epidemic in the community was tight, and there were more orders for the purchase of sterilized alcohol. The little oranges took the goods and let the driver be transported to the community door. When the sun was directly sunburned, I threw a help information in the buying medicine group: Who can come down to help? As a result, a 50 -year -old uncle came down for a long time. The big box of wine was really heavy, and finally I had to decide to send a notice to the buyer and divide it on the spot. A 60 -year -old Shanghai grandfather's uncle shakes away to pick up alcohol. He saw the little oranges and the uncle who had come down to help before sweating, and muttered: Louji is difficult to buy alcohol. It ’s really embarrassed to buy it, but it’ s unwilling to buy it. Little Orange is not angry or complained, but he is happy. In fact, she doesn't feel that she is not from Shanghai. She feels that she has already become a member of this community. ""You see, I don’t know how many people in the community. She also comforted the uncle, ""Noon, everyone may be sleeping, and most of them are old people who buy medicine, which is inconvenient."" Little Orange can think in other ways. There were still people who doubted whether she wanted to make money from it, otherwise who would be so free? Little Orange does not explain. Every time I give the invoice sheet to buy the medicine to the other party, there are a few points, which is refreshing. Each medicine is sold at a parity and does not make a penny! Not only that, she also paid by herself, and the residents received the payment when they received the medicine. Little Orange said she chose to trust. But obviously, not everyone is trustworthy. Once, the residents in a building obviously asked for ten boxes of flowers to clear the plague capsule, and also had antigen reagents, and repeatedly confirmed in the group. "" In this money, Little Orange had to eat it by itself. Little Orange lives in Building 2. As soon as the medicine arrived, after the division, she moved a table at the corner of the door of the house, and then called one by one in the large group. Let's take it. What impressed the little orange was that there was a aunt who was in his 70s and took medicine alone. She bought a non -Luo Di flat -release tablet, a medicine for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Auntie came to pay for medicine. She had no WeChat nor Alipay, and she brought a bunch of change. Little Orange: At this time, who still collects banknotes? Xiao Orange really wanted to give the aunt for exemption directly, but it was actually not much money, but I thought it was not good. I still collected it after repeated disinfection. She doesn't want the old man to feel ""disgusted"". ""If this aunt is my old man, I don't want them to feel bad. For the old and weak, we should just care more."" Little Orange also has grandparents and grandparents in the house. The elderly who are thousands of miles pass the phone and greetings, so that the old people can rest assured. Later, she prescribed a ""pharmaceutical shop"" in the community and went out for the residents to buy medicine. I never told her family, ""I'm afraid they are worried, and every time they take care of me: good at home, do not go anywhere, don’t go anywhere . I don't want them to worry about me. I am pretty good in Shanghai. ""Just now, she is a volunteer in the community as a volunteer. She is too busy. Every day, the phone is about to be exploded by the neighbors of the community. On one occasion, she even received a SMS notification from China Mobile: This phone uses abnormalities and needs to take protective measures for your number. After some explanations, the line continued. Resident residents are grateful. That day, Xiao Orange said in the group: The weather was really hot. As a result, I received a lot of gifts at once: drinks, cold drinks, and oranges. ""This is the rhythm of feeding me."" Not the residents of this community also began to ask her to help buy medicine. The two are too busy now, and do one thing to do it solidly. Moreover, I always have to be responsible for myself and the residents in the community. ""Little Orange said repeatedly that he is not great. It is also very ""greedy for death"". That day, I didn't see the antigen test for a while, thinking that she had two bars, and she collapsed all at once. ""I couldn't hold it all at once, and I cried for a while."" It's wrong. Little Orange said nothing, immediately wiped his tears, and turned to get the medicine again.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-23/8.htm,4/23/22,,

She also takes a three -year -old daughter. She asked for help in the circle of friends. I think of a brother Yuan Jianguo in the reading group. He is a small farm called Yamana in Chongming. On April 6, I called Lao Yuan countless telephones and did not get through. Until 10 pm, the call was connected. He told me that he was sending vegetables at Minhang, and he went to the gate at a high speed. I just begged him to help Bei Cai's mother and daughter. He grunted hoarsely: ""I didn't eat meals, and I was delivered to the middle of the night today."" Promise to add one tomorrow. At twelve o'clock in the evening, I chased a phone call to confirm.

The Chongming Chenqiao has passed the Yangtze River Bridge and Tunnel of more than 30 kilometers, and he sent more than 1,000 dishes in three days. At two o'clock in the morning, I rushed to the airport town and walked around countless curves. Finally, I saw an old couple waiting on the side of the road. When Master Yuan took the vegetables, Lao Yuan was in a hurry to get out of the car, and his feet fell to the ground when his feet were soft. The old couple looked at the old couple full of silver hair: ""If you don't go, your life is also important! God will remember it on the book, good people report!""

He rented 86 acres of land in Chongming, raised chicken, ducks, plant rice and vegetables, friends, and fishing. The days in the countryside are relaxed and happy, but they have met the epidemic. Originally, Chongming was also sealed. He simply stopped the conventional food delivery work. I did not expect that countless friends who came out suddenly burst the phone call and asked him to send out the dishes for emergency. Lao Yuan looked at his two -year -old wife and rubbed his hands and said, ""There is no way, it's all friends."" Master Yuan said: ""In this life, I followed the toss."" When people drove, she forced her to sleep until six o'clock. She accompanied the car and brought gum, tens of gold oil and a large pot of coffee to prevent fatigue driving. Lao Yuan drove, Master Yuan was responsible for calling. He always had to go 500 kilometers a day and burned a box of 60 liters of oil every day. Every time I encounter a high -speed rest station, go to the toilet. Buy some water at noon to eat snacks. Dinner must be eaten after going home in the middle of the night. I don't want to take a bath. At this time, the epidemic was even more urgent. It is a friend. If this Chen Guang does not help, it really becomes a friend of wine and meat everywhere, and no one will be saved at the critical moment. ""The couple decided"" good people to do it.

But for these ""friends"" that emerged, the two of them had the courier brothers who sent the door to the door. On the 15th, one of my Wen friends called and told me that her friends lived in a pair of old couples in Yangpu District. Seeing that the materials at home decreased day by day without grabbing food. When my friend was in a hurry, I asked me to ask Lao Yuan to rescue the emergency. I can only ask Lao Yuan to ""Gasai"" again. He agreed again, ""All are friends."" The next day he gave priority to the Yangpu family. When Master Yuan was wearing a protective suit and handed the dishes over the railing, a white bangs floated in the spring breeze.

Space,Hundred years old Kong Rou,Space,"In the past few days, Mr. Kongrou ushered in the joy of Yiyi. Among the poets in Shanghai, there are many elderly lives, but only Kong Rou has entered the threshold of the 100 -year -old. Recently, I went to his house to worship, and he said that he had seen me and remembered it. I was surprised by his memory. More than two decades ago, he held a poetic activity in the Association's Hall. Among the many members, he always arrived early and sat on the last seat. At the end of the meeting, he left alone. Later, he gradually came, and I gradually forgot him. When I met, I asked him that he had not participated in poetry activities for many years. He replied that his old thoughts were not sharp, and his poetic feelings were not agile. He mainly wrote some old poems, so he was embarrassed. I think that some poets enter the old realm and gradually stay away from the new poems and regain their old poems. Mr. Xin Di wrote a lot of old poems in his later years, and said to me: New poems are easy to learn and difficult! The old body poems look difficult to write, and it is not difficult to enter the door. Kong Rou and Xin Di have the same writing. In his life, he was happy, and he spit it quickly. He integrated the armpit. Twenty years ago, he published the collection of old style poems ""The Floating Collection"". The name of this book is his life compared to the sea canoe in the sea, floating in the wind and waves. He wrote a new poem to write old poems, and also wrote a comment on ""Going into the Mind World"", and also translated a number of scripts such as the novel ""Dawn"" and Iraracida ""Lantern"". His experience is unique and rich among Shanghai poetry people. In April 1922, Kong Rou was born in a book incense in Qufu, Shandong, next to Longhu Street under Mount Tai. In Confucius, the poems are deeply traditionally traditionally. He is in the court training. After finishing his homework daily, he has to read some classical poems. In addition to the Book of Songs, there are also Tang poems and modern poems translated from European and American poets. Starting from the excerpts of the famous sentences, I am obsessed with five words and seven, and also learned graffiti. However, the Japanese invaded China in an all -round way, and Qufu had fallen, and the school could not let a calm desk. He and his progressive classmates yearn for Yan'an and quietly left home. He went to Xi'an via Nanjing, Bengbu, and Luoyang. However, due to traffic blocked, he went to Chongqing behind the big rear and was admitted to Chongqing Minzhi News College. Along the way, the scene of the country's death and the people of the people was miserable. Kong Rou was sad and excited, and his poetic was full of blood. He thought that in such a harsh environment, he must reflect this era in a more powerful poetry form. He began to abandon the writing of old -body poems, expressing his mind with new poems to meet the needs of fast -paced real life. He and several classmates who love poetry were not afraid of the sinister environment and the poverty of the economy. He established the ""Poist Poetry Society"". Everyone would rather bear the hunger. In addition to writing poems by themselves, they also asked the famous poets, Xu Chi, and Wang Yaiping to send poems in Chongqing. After the first issue, he received many praise. They continue to work hard and quickly arrange the second period of manuscript. However, due to the advancement of the content of the poetry and the interference of the authorities, coupled with a sufficient printing fee for a while, the second phase was finally born in the death. After the victory of the Anti -Japanese War, Kong Rou came to Shanghai and could not find a job for a while. He used the time to write poems, and chose appropriate ones such as ""Pao Tong"" and ""Give Fan Yan"", and published them in the supplements of ""Poetry Creation"" and ""Dagong"". Once, in the case of living, he kept a friend of his leather box in the storage room of the Xinmin Daily. Due to the tendency to make progress in newspapers, it was seized by the authorities. After the setting off, after the newspaper broke out, Kong Rou rushed to the newspaper to find his own suitcase, but he could not find it. He was not some clothes in the box, but the precious collection of precious poems he bought, and his letters and letters of poetry friends. I remember that there were more than twenty poems in the manuscript, of which ""narrowed winding slate tract/bamboo fence cottage"", which wrote the status quo of the suffering of the year. There are also sentences of ""fighting fires and flying like Taoyuan here"", writing an optimistic attitude in a difficult environment. After 1949, Kong Rou was transferred from the Post Office to the Editorial Publishing House as the editor -in -chief, and then to Beijing, and served as the editor of the theoretical reading of the worker publisher. He remembers that in order to group a good manuscript, he boldly opened the door of the People's Literature Publishing House, and was warmly received and strongly supported by the president Wang Renhu (Ba Ren). In the 1950s, he was mistaken for ""right"" and decentralized in Yunnan. With his literary skills, he entered the editorial department of ""Frontier Literature and Art"" and served as the poem team leader. At the beginning of the new period, Kong Rou was an editor -in -chief of the ""Harvest"" magazine that has been rehabilitated and returned to the long -awaited Shanghai. After reading, I couldn't help but be able to write ""Postscript"" and published it in the magazine of ""Harvest"" that year. In those years, in the editorial department of ""Harvest"", it was Kong Rou's most comfortable happy time. That year, under the leadership of Bajin and Wu Qiang, he and the editors of the editorial department and the young and middle -aged writers from all over the world wrote a masterpiece after attending the first creation of Mogan Mountain to participate in the re -publication. Pakistan wrote the postscript of ""Equipment"", and the money was ""in Mogan Mountain on August 10, 1981"". For the eight days of the pen, Kong Rou's poetic rose was rising, writing a set of ""Mogan Mountain Miscellaneous"" (six songs). Later, he went to Hangzhou with the elderly writer and old editor to live in the ""Creation Home"" for a few days to talk to you about life exchanges. ""Harvest"" old colleague Peng Xinqi knew much about Kong Rou's character and high evaluation. It is said that Kongrou from Shanghai to Beijing to Yunnan, and has been separated for a long time, but has no complaints. He has won the honor of the national excellent literary editor. He is a good editor who is really obscure and is a wedding dress for writers.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-24/7.htm,4/24/22,,
Space,Shape a beautiful heart for children,Space,"Chuan Zhongfu Children's Art Theater is 75 years old. I am a few years older than it, it is its old ""fan"". For decades, it has been unforgettable for my spiritual inspiration and artistic appreciation. There are too many content, just talk about it from the perspective of the repertoire. Children's art was under the care of Chairman Song Qingling himself, breaking the soil in the darkest day before dawn. When it was formally established, it has ushered in the brilliant sunshine of New China. As the earliest art group for children, it has become a good teacher and friend of generations, leaving beautiful memories in the hearts of countless audiences. The decades of children's achievements can be reflected most clearly from its drama. Before 1949, I was still a primary school student, and I had been in contact with the ""Table"" and ""Little Master"" they played, leaving a deep impression. After 1949, from ""Snowflake"" and ""Little White Rabbit"" to ""Friendship"" and ""Preparation of Moment"" reflecting children's lives, they all attracted the vast number of audiences. In particular, some of the short dramas and songs, song and dance programs they arranged, such as ""We all have one volunteer"", ""two small captains"", etc., went deep into school performances, and even counseled the small students themselves. When I was on the first day, I played the ""Huang Dabao's OK"" written by Teacher Sun Yi. These plays are vivid and vivid, with diverse forms, full of the atmosphere of the times, and entertaining, which has greatly educated children. Later, the successful performance of ""Ma Lanhua"" opened a unique road to the creation of Chinese fairy tale dramas. It can be seen that from the beginning, children's art has laid a good foundation in the direction and practice of the repertoire. After work, children's drama has seen less, but at the same time, it feels that it has gradually grown up and mature. After retirement, especially in these decade, I have become its audience again. In close contact with it, I have become more and more realized that it has formed its own characteristics on the repertoire. Its drama is mainly based on modern themes, and has never forgotten the main service target is children. It has a lot of themes that reflect the revolutionary struggle, but try to focus on children's lives, such as ""Underground Young Pioneer"" and ""Children's Drama"". It is more about the story of contemporary children. The horizons are wide and ingenious, not only limited to family and classrooms, but not ears and diagram policies. For example, ""There is a pink cloud in the mountains"", communicate with the children of Shanghai and the ethnic minorities in the southwestern southwest. Through the clever plot, in the context of the difference between the differences between urban and rural areas and regions, it reflects the true appearance of Chinese children's lives. Practical education for them and struggle. Another example is ""Encay"". The story takes place in the environment of the earthquake. The protagonist is a child who loves drumming. Through his unique experience of his drums, he has shaped the image of a little protagonist who dares to fight and fight. They did not forget the ancient subjects, and insisted on digging from the treasures of Chinese traditional culture to the spiritual food that was beneficial to niche audiences. They have performed ""Sima Guang"" and ""Dayu Governance"", and also performed ""Oriental Story"" composed of several fragments, such as ""Yan Zixiao Chu"" and ""Sanke Lane"". The latter can also enter school, combined with teaching. It is hoped that in this regard, classical literary factors represented by ancient poems can be better integrated. Fairy tales and myths are important spiritual food for children. Children's art has achieved significant achievements in this regard. They successfully performed the fairy tale masterpiece ""The Daughter of the Sea"", ""Twelve months"", ""The Ugly Princess"" ... Created and performed new fairy dramas like ""White Horse Feifei"", which can be described as unique in the combination of fairy tales and real life. They also creatively adapted the famous films like Titanic into a fairy tale and changed the characters into animals such as cats and dogs. It's not easy. They also adapted world masterpieces such as ""Notre Dame"" and ""Misery World"", and worked hard on cultural popularization. The years are flowing, the children's art is not forgotten, and the hardships are constant. Recently, they were re -line up ""Song Qingling and Children"". I felt very good when I watched it. It should be refined into a reserved repertoire, so that it will always flash in the children's drama garden in China and the world in China and the world.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-24/8.htm,4/24/22,8th Edition: Nights Cup,

Mr. Wang praised the baby's daughter's calligraphy. He used the four words of Li Kexi. On the 29th, the age of age, sunny. The scenery is very bright, plum blossoms. The family resigned, drinking Su Su, and exquisite food, two bowls for meals. Tongzhi nine years, 1870, the fifth day of the first month. Children are all from the beginning, welcoming the spring, and eating cakes. Then ride a horse to visit the visitors, go home in the evening, go to the home cake is hot, eat sixteen of them, and add a bowl of meals. Mr. Wang's food was very good, it was surprising that his wife and concubine made cakes under the kitchen. This is the fifth day of the first month of the first month. Think about the fifth day of the year. It is usually so tired that you just want to find some white porridge and rice graphic granic bean sprouts to clear the stomach and stomach. At the eleventh month of the first month, watching the dream dumplings at night, until the ugly starts. Mr. Wang's sleeves, not reading or writing, quietly watching his wife made dumplings, and always saw a little late at night. With such a scene, the small family and the family are still. In the diary of the 15th of the first month, ten dumplings were written. The dumplings of Hunan people do not know how the size is? What kind of pearl round jade is like Ningbo Sesame Tumping, or is it like a small pillow style like the Qibao Meat Soup Troupe? On February 12th, Mr. Wang went out to visit friends. He used dinner at his friends' house and went home to keep in the diary. The sauce is sauce, the sauce duck, the wild duck, and only the tight and good meat of the chest and abdomen, it is naturally praised, reminiscent of the smoke duck in Chaozhou cuisine. This meal is waiting for the meal, eating well, and the tenderness of the hometown of fish and rice. The old king was in a good mood. He wrote two small poems and returned to Liuyun. Pharaoh's wife and a concubine can be poetic. In the old women, when they were outstanding, Mr. Wang's gorgeous blessings were deep. On the 14th, friends sent eight distant things and four plum blossoms. Far things are good things in the distant place. Translating is a souvenir in the distance. Mr. Wang got a specialty and wrote poems and thanked. Record two sentences: Longjing Xiangya Tianmu bamboo shoots, one light seems to be in Xiling. Mr. Wang got Longjing and bamboo shoots, as if he dream of returning to Su Hang. Think of 150 years later, those who bring buns to the European Hometown are still these comforts and nostalgia, tea and bamboo shoots. On the fifteenth day, Mr. Wang still stayed in a friend's house to play. He worshiped his mother's life in the morning and had five bowls of noodles. Mr. Wang is really a big name. He dares to do it and dares to do it. He is romantic. If you want to eat, eat five bowls of life. On the day of the two three days, it was warm, and Haitang Mountain Tea opened.

Space,The story of Building No. 19,Space,"Weng Yang's epidemic came, and the rhythm of people's lives and work was disrupted. Waiting quietly at home, the best performance is not to leave home. The outside world has calmed down, and people's hearts are inevitably disturbed and worried. Fortunately, the charm of life often allows you to see light in the dark, and enjoy joy in sorrow. After living in the building for 18 years, we suddenly received the call from the organization: ""We live in the same building, called the"" No. 19 Garden City Phase II "", everyone actively enters the group and help each other."" Do you come and go? ""The 54 households in our building are happy to enter the"" big family "", and the family does not fall. With ""big head"" and ""big living room"". In the face of the anti -epidemic war, we no longer fight alone, and 138 family members have become a group. Two years ago, the COVID-19 virus invaded Shanghai and was very satisfied with the anti-disinfecting work of his own building, thinking that it was accurate to be the cleaners responsible for cleaning the floor. After entering the door, I learned that the two elevators and the environmental disappearance of the 18 -story corridor were conscious actions of residents in this building. The leader is Teacher Chen, Room 602. He paid for his own pocket, spent money to buy disinfectant and watering pots, and consciously do a good job of disinfecting the corridor every day in proportion. Beginning in March of this year, four or five old gentlemen in the building took the initiative to take turns to enter the battle, carefully and thoughtful and thoughtful. Terminate each other, help each other, and encourage each other to become the door of Building 19. During the epidemic, there were more than seven things that opened the door of the residential building. Nucleic acid screening, antigen detection, material distribution, meals for the elderly, seeking medical treatment for medical treatment, buying food, garbage management ... complicated work. In the face of this test papers, Chen Wanhong, the team leader of Room 502, is a big family. She said that it wasn't how magically she was individual because there was a group of people behind her. The tasks arranged by the cadres of the neighborhood committee were hung in the ""Living Room"", and the volunteers in the building had grabbed the order. Usually do not show up, showing his hands in war. Surprised found that there were all ways to hide in the 19th. The list of 54 households on the 18 floors found out at once, and the basic state of each house also understood. The 7 team leaders were born. Households can pass the test results in time. The sharing of everyone who can get vegetables and milk was originally a ""family doctor"" that medical staff re -fired the old industry. Good for cooking in the living room. The clever women race different cooking skills in the same vegetable. When going out to test, the old man needs a wheelchair. The rice -roasted rice lacks salt meat. The lack of garlic and ginger. You squeake what you ask for in the ""big living room"" and immediately send enthusiastic people to the door. I also accidentally missed a sentence and did not buy cabbage. Sister Wei, the 1302 room, immediately sent it to the door. There are often chief engineers, university professors, educational experts, scientists, and financialists who often come out with doubts. There are also young young people who like to take the humorous paragraph to make my uncle smile easily ... Nucleic acid testing is praised. The 138 people in Building 19 are the most neat, the most important rules, and the most civilized and polite. Everyone immediately put on a mask and said ""thank you"" immediately after testing. When the medical staff finished working, I heard so many ""thank you"" for the first time today, which is really warm. The residents in Building 19 were proud of this feedback. Medical staff in other provinces and municipalities came to assist in the help. Shanghai citizens need to know the grace. This has become a new round of topic. For the first time in my life, I participated in the work of issuing antigen test reagents. It was distributed from house to house. It was not afraid and was quite satisfied. To clarify the essentials and precautions of the operation, the other thanks of the other thanks warm heart. Fighting with such a reasonable citizen, the victims are full of confidence. At 8 am on April 5th, there were three more than three of the antigen detection results. There was no echo for the call of the mobile phone. He went upstairs and knocked on the door and asked the situation. The dad in Room 1802 was embarrassed to say hello to everyone: ""Sleep late, the mobile phone is quiet, my family is all overcast, thank you for your concern."" At 4:30 in the morning, the small birds in the shade of the tree shared, and the trail was busy. A 69 -year -old, 18 -year -old, volunteer in Building 19 is two generations of Shanghai good men.

At this time, Shanghai Thunderbolt yellow and strong blue and blue dual warning high. The reporter learned from the headquarters of many squares hospital that before the arrival of severe weather, all the cabins had made plans to respond to ensure the safety of patients in the cabin. In the Tianhua Road Class Hospital, which is also managed by the Longhua Hospital Medical Team, a sandbag was poured into the door to prevent rainwater from pouring in. The newly admitted patients also settled in the meal before the heavy rain arrived, and had dinner. The medical staff in the class picked up the hard cardboard or garbage bag on the head and shuttled between the two cabins. The cleaning staff took the rain to clean up the toilet.

In these days, each nucleic acid detection is a middle -aged male volunteer ""shouting wheat"" again and again, full of energy and power. With many previous experiences, today's all -member nucleic acid detection can be described as smooth and smooth. The community made full use of the existing space to design a fixed line for each residents of each building, and even use the cobblestone road that winds in the green belt. The heavy rain last night made the path a little muddy, and the ""big white"" was covered with wooden boards in advance.

SPACE,"After the intervention of Chinese medicine, patients can speed up the cabin","—— Zhang Boli, an academician visiting the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine","On April 24th, Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, was interviewed by the media on the relevant issues of this round of epidemic in Shanghai. He said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, the core disease of Omikon's mutant strain has not changed significantly compared with the previous, and it still belongs to the category of ""epidemic"" disease in traditional Chinese medicine. The cause is to feel the epidemic. Different factors such as eating habits are slightly different in syndrome characteristics. The performance of cold, hot, drying, and stasis appears. Shanghai is a kind of wet poisonous wind heat. Zhang Boli believes that the square cabin hospital has played an important role in classification and layered treatment. ""For the treatment of asymptomatic infections, Western medicine is asymptomatic, and Chinese medicine has evidence. For example, some asymptomatic infected people, although there are no symptoms of COVID-19, may be burnout, greasy tongue, stagnant stool, abdominal distension, abdominal distension TCM and other traditional Chinese medicine syndromes are used at this stage to intervene in time with Chinese medicine to regulate the immune function. They can often achieve better results, so that they do not become the diagnostic, and promote the rapid transition of nucleic acids. ""Therefore, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine is adopted. Active intervention is to promote the rapid turns of nucleic acids, prevent the progress of the disease, and reach the compartment standards at an early date and return to normal life. According to Zhang Boli, from the perspective of the preliminary use, COVID-19 virus infection was asymptomatic. After the use of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in patients with mild patients, it showed a good efficacy trend in reducing the rotation rate and reducing the time out of the cabin. Earlier, a data from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine showed that the average nucleic acid to the yin of the asymptomatic infection in the cabin was about 4 days. At the same time, according to the needs of patients, under the premise of voluntary, taking Chinese medicine, such as Chinese medicine, formula particles, etc. The three principles Zhang Boli revealed the situation of the elderly infected in the Shanghai epidemic. ""First, the proportion of elderly people over the age of 60 in the case of confirmed cases accounts for 30 %; second, most elderly people have basic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, tumor, uremia, etc. COVID-19 is added together, which will lead to serious illness, and the condition is progressing rapidly. It is easy to turn into severe and critical illnesses. It needs to pay special attention. ""Zhang Boli introduced that the first principle of the treatment of elderly infections is"" new and old diseases take care of both new and old diseases take care "", COVID-19, pay more attention to the treatment of basic diseases, and pay particular attention to basic disease changes. From the perspective of treatment experience, it is not difficult to treat COVID-19 alone, but it is difficult to treat unstable basic diseases. The second principle is ""to righteousness and dispel evil."" The elderly often lack of righteousness, virtual damage, poor blood, poor blood, phlegm turbid stasis and other basic disease evidence. It is easy to increase quickly after infection with the COVID-19 virus. , Adopt methods such as qi and promoting blood, nourishing qi and nourishing yin. In the evil evil, pay attention to ""Qing"" and ""Tong"", and can be used to clear heat and detoxify, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. The third principle is the treatment of the first movement, the symptoms of the symptoms, and cut off the disease. Patients from asymptomatic to symptoms are a process, and they need to intervene early. For example, in clinical practice, although some elderly patients seem to be ordinary, when the fever continues to continue, the stool, constipation, phlegm sticky, and the lungs are not absorbed, they must hurry up. Time treatment. The key is to grasp the symptoms of the disease that may affect the worsening of the disease at that time, and treat the development of the disease. Zhang Boli said that it is necessary to distinguish between high -risk people and attach importance to basic diseases, multi -disciplinary union, early intervention, syndrome discrimination, one person and one strategy, seize the main symptoms and core disease machines to determine the strategy of combining clinical treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. One ""early"" and ""quasi"" Zhang Boli believes that for the treatment of patients with severe and critical illnesses, the first thing to emphasize is multi -disciplinary cooperation. Each subject exerts its own advantages and collective efforts. , Reversing the disease and reducing the disease rate. According to factors such as basic diseases, the most dangerous factors of each patient adopt the method of dialectical and targeted treatment strategies for each patient. Specifically, it is a ""early"", a ""quasi"", early discovery, early warning, early research, and early intervention. Take targeted precision treatment, ""one person, one policy, one person, one side, one party one party"" method. Specific treatment should be ""fast"", sometimes ""stable"", patiently observe the changes in symptoms, and stability is not aggravated. Sometimes it is necessary to ""support"". Yang Qifu should use large doses to attach back to Yang to rescue the reverse, and to turn the tide. Traditional Chinese medicine injections are used in therapeutic drugs, Chinese medicine retains enema, ginseng powder, rhubarb powder, acupuncture therapy, etc. In emergency medication, the blood must be pushed by blood, phlegm heat and clear pumps, Angong Niuhuang Wan and other internal orbitals. It plays a good role in stabilizing the condition and blocking progress. Since the emergence of recovery COVID-19 epidemic, people have paid attention to whether there are sequelae. The patient can be discharged out of the cabin after complying with the requirements of relevant indicators. However, some people have not completely cured, some people have not fully recovered their immune function, and others have damaged the heart, liver, kidney, etc. due to the COVID-19 virus, and the functional indicators are not normal. Therefore, there is a process of recovery for COVID-19 patients with discharge. Zhang Boli introduced: ""Summarize the recovery of patients in Wuhan and the future epidemic. The concept of 'combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine is generally adopted, and western medicine does health assessment, and Chinese medicine promotes rehabilitation. ""According to reports, after active recovery, the relevant symptoms of most people are basically eliminated within three months to half a year. Zhang Boli pointed out that healing himself must also make positive mentality and mental state adjustments, and actively participate in recovery. In this regard, we should also emphasize that the patients who do not discriminate against COVID-19 in the society should have more care for them.

The ""community management and control operation"" ranked first in the Nine Congress of Zero-Covid, which is currently carried out in this city. In recent days, the city's grass -roots communities have been going all out, keeping the door and optimistic people, and minimizing the gathering of personnel flow. The seal -controlled area strictly implements the requirements of ""not leaving the house and the service on -site""; the control area strictly implements the requirements of ""no people from the community (unit), and the peaks to take things""; Chengqiao Second Village Community in Changning District did not leave the house to serve the service team quickly assembled on the evening of April 24th. At the entrance of Chengqiao Ercun District, Changning District, a group of living materials distributed by a group of Jaeqiao Street have arrived. Yu Hongjuan, the secretary of the party branch of Chengqiao Ercun, was in response to the small team of the material handling. Everyone and the cadres of the neighborhood committee were carried by the cadres of the neighborhood committee. At 8 pm, they sent all the materials to the residents' homes.

Six small teams such as the delivery of the meal, the division of labor and cooperation, and actively carried out the volunteer service of the epidemic prevention and control. Because the community is sampled every day, the workload is very large, and the nucleic acid sampling team also increases from the original 5 groups to 8 groups. As the number of volunteers increases and the number of times is increasing, the degree of cooperation becomes higher and higher, and the time of residents of community residents has shrunk from one and a half hours a day to two and a half hours. It is worth mentioning that the community adopts the detection method of ""residents do not move, big white movement"". In addition to the on -site test of the Yanglou or the special crowd, the normal building is the sampling person who arrives in the downstairs, and the residents go downstairs to test it. 66 There are 66 detection points in each building, minimizing the aggregation of personnel flow. The problem of garbage and transportation in the sealing community also needs to be very careful. The garbage clearance team led by the property manager starts from 7 pm to collecting domestic garbage from the gate of each unit, and then shipped to the gate of the community. It is always busy until 112 pm. In addition, the home delivery team will go to the neighborhood committee at noon every day to receive the box lunch to give love meals for 10 elderly people who live alone, and give them special care. Our reporter Tu Yu Songjiang District Zhonghai Yueting Community's defense zone defense zone and there are chapters in the presence of chapters. Due to sporadic new cases, 168 people in 45 households in the west of the community are classified as the seal control area. In the prevention area, the impact of the epidemic on the lives of the residents is reduced as much as possible ... This is the real scene of the Zhonghai Yueting Community in Xiangxin, Dongjing Town, Songjiang District. How can we control the premium control area in the same community? Lu Yijun, Secretary of the Party Branch of Xiangxin, Xiangxin, Dongjing Town, introduced the relevant situation to the reporter. ""The 4 communities in our Xiangxin residential area, including apartments, superpositions, rows, and independent buildings. The reporter, the other six social workers' incarnations of the neighborhood committees sank into various communities, and there are more than 160 volunteers of party members, which are scattered in the buildings of various buildings. ""Considering that the former building team leader was older and was not used to smartphones, we asked party members volunteers, in -service party members to serve as the"" Leader of the Second Party Member Building ""."" Become a chapter to follow. At present, some physical partitions have been done in Zhonghai Yueting Community. The Western District Independence and Control District is uniformly exported to the entrance for property and social workers and nucleic acid testing personnel. Lu Yijun introduced that the ""not leaving home"" in the seal -control area was strictly implemented, and other residents and volunteers could not enter this area. The needs of materials and drugs are uniformly purchased by the town's material classes or the neighborhood committee. ""Strict characters are the head, but the service is meticulous."" The management in the prevention area in the Eastern District is also not loose. Among them, the elimination of foreign courier items is one of the key points. ""Delivery master Note: On -site antigen negative re -unload!"" At the door of the Yueting Community of Zhonghai, the delivery process was clearly written on the signs, and a special disinfection area was divided. Outside the community, a red carpet is covered by the shelves. The courier first disinfect the sole here. After the antigen is tested, it can be unloaded. These migrant items are uniformly disinfected by volunteers. After removing for 30 minutes, they are moved to the shelves on the inside of the community. Since the occurrence of this round of epidemic, Lu Yijun led six staff members to the neighborhood committee, and some have never returned home for more than 40 days. Lu Yijun is a second -child mother. Dabao in the family goes to elementary school and Erbao to kindergarten. It is when they need to take care of it, but they have not seen each other for more than a month. ""It was very difficult at first. During that time, I couldn't video with my children. When I saw their tears, I couldn't stop. Afterwards, I slowly adjusted my mentality."" Lu Yijun said, ""Other friends in the neighborhood committee also have no time to take care of it. Many children, many people are both husband and wife are fighting against the front line. We encourage each other and everyone cheers together. """" 7 people serve more than 7,000 residents, and one person can be ""thousands of troops and horses'."" Lu Yijun said They will rule out all difficulties and lead Xiangxin's residents to adhere to the position until they defeat the epidemic.

Space,The place where we stand is Shanghai,Space,"On April 5th, the ""Nightlight Cup"" of the New People's Evening News published the short essay I wrote, ""Thousands of Normal Days"". I used the white trails without any modification, and narrated the most common nucleic acid testing, ""Bai Bai"" and the neighborhood committee's anti -epidemic scenes of the Shanghai people who had seen it. Unexpectedly, the word 1500 stirred up the unexpected social response. First, the ""Chinese Art Headline"" of the Ministry of Culture carefully used red words to highlight the reading effect of key words, and received 185,000 readers like it. Sohu, Sina, Tencent, Netease, Shangguan, People's Information, Interface News ... major websites have reprinted. When the Xinhuanet Client Galaxy Office's studio was reproduced, the editor -in -chief of Ms. Zhang Shuyun asked the Shanghai painter Ye Xiong to carefully select the theme works of Shanghai painters such as Wang Jiafang, Zhu Xinchang, and Zhang Anpu. At the same time, Xinhua Finance and Guangming Daily The recommendation of China Military Network is recommended. On the day of the reproduction, 1.219 million readers clicked. As of my writing, 6 days after writing a total of 1.517 million. At this moment, Shanghai is not lonely, and the people of the whole country set their attention to Shanghai. Over the years, most of my texts are forced by newspapers and all aspects. In these days, I witnessed the raging epidemic and worried. The chief editor of the Luminous Cup urged me from time to time in a few days after the city sealed on April 1: ""Do you want to ask you to write a home experience?"" ""Can you come here today?"" ... Give me to me An example in life, especially ""refueling to Shanghai"", touched my tears at once. I should write for this city where I raised me and what my father and fellow who were struggling. I have worked in the Shanghai Writers Association for 8 years. Every year on November 25, we will hold a bouquet of flowers to the elderly for the elderly. Bayan taught us, tell the truth, and give the readers to readers. I don't want to moan without illness nor tipping it cheaply. I just want to express that even what I see is the truth of the surface. Therefore, I write the most common and no dramatic scenes. In the end, a period of WeChat of our street cadres, Xiaocheng, did not avoid the negative emotions in their hearts. Then, in order to ""return everyone to a"" everything as usual '"", we went forward. Living in Shanghai, we pass by almost every day with the skyscrapers in the top of the sky. They draw a modern skyline in the sun. In fact, the majesty of the skyscraper is supported by the foundation that is deeply tied underground. It is the 25 million Poping Shanghai people that support this great city, Shanghai. 25 million Shanghai people, do not leave home, can think about it, what does this mean? Everyone is silently endured, persisted, fighting the invisible Omikon, testing again and again, again and again, and countless buildings. The difficulty of overcoming, and there are many new words of ""time and space companion"", writing a silent and tragic page. Different from the hero of the war, the hero fried bunkers and the eyes of the gun, the hero of the peaceful age is in adversity and crisis, watching each other. Needless to say, we heard crying and had pain, but we also shouted, more helpful ... Everyone adhered to the ""proud patience"" in Pushkin's verses with their own dignity. When the last few spring breeze passed our testing team this year, it must have heard our heartbeat. In 2020, COVID-19 raid the Jianghan Plain, and the Shanghai Medical Team went against the wind on New Year's Eve. I sent a period of WeChat that I later reposted on the entire network: ""I like two sides like a city: a little thing is afraid of death, such as lean ice; Heaven is not afraid of death, and life is righteous. The more civilized the city, the more personal the personal life value, and the more happy to the extreme of the personal life value. ""Remember that someone said that the place where you are standing is China, you are bright China is not dark. Yes, every Shanghai person stands, which is Shanghai, is the city of a great hero. We are bright, Shanghai is not dark! In the silent waiting, the back of the spring of 2022 was gradually disappearing in the fine rain of Jiangnan. From the found neighbor on April 7, a positive neighbor was allowed to be allowed to go downstairs for nucleic acid on April 19th. Now I found that all the golden ginkgo trees that were once golden. The hair is shining and sinking; there is a half -semi -maple tree stump that extends out of the corner of the building like a fire. Outside the window, the sun is just right. We are not leaving home. Looking up, the sky is more transparent than the sea water. In these days, I don't have no sadness and confusion, and WeChat WeChat that needs help and rescue from time to time. But seeing ""Dabai"", volunteers, property management, courier brother, neighborhood committee cadres, and doctors and nurses from all over the country. Their busy figures and tired face can only defeat myself weaknesses. Persevere ... I have persisted for so many days, and I have seen the virtuous light at the end of the long tunnel!

"Cai Guoqiang, Vice President of Fang Calcule Builder Shanghai Construction Engineering Group",35 days to move to three square cabin hospitals,Space,"""We must adapt to the characteristics of each project. When the workers do, when will I accompany?"" Cai Guoqiang, vice president of Shanghai Construction Engineering Group, has ""reached the axis"" for 35 days in such a high -intensity state and invested in the construction of three square cabin hospitals without returning home. The first square hospital of Cai Guoqiang was in the Minhang Stadium. He and more than 900 technicians and front -line workers struggled for 72 hours in a row day and night, transforming Minhang Stadium into a square cabin hospital with 800 mild and asymptomatic infections and sewage treatment and air purification functions. Due to the wind throughout the stadium, the reconstruction of the Minhang Cabin Hospital is very difficult, and the construction period is only three days. All the builders have almost no time to sleep. As the general commander of the project, Cai Guoqiang is basically when the workers do when they do it. Not long after, Cai Guoqiang moved to the construction of the new International Expo Center's square cabin hospital. ""The original design plan found that there were part of the unsuitable place after the project started. The design plan of the sewage and wastewater discharge system needs to be optimized. President Cai personally participated in the guidance at the scene. The project needs.

At this time, he was hoarse in his throat, and he could speak with spray drugs. After arriving at the scene of Jinshan, it is still difficult -insufficient hydropower, old mottled walls, and garbage and miscellaneous accumulation in the factory where the Kingsoft Fang Caval Hospital is located. The overall construction foundation is poor and the construction is more difficult. It is too late to rectify at all, and you can't care about fine planning. You can only build the field. When installing the water inlet system, according to the original plan, the relevant equipment materials are provided and installed by external suppliers. However, suppliers cannot meet the requirements due to Shanghai sealing control. Cai Guoqiang first transferred the support of the pressure container factory owned by the Shanghai Construction Industry Installation Group. On the same day, the relevant equipment materials personnel entered the market and completed the installation of the stainless steel water tank on time. Each square cabin construction project is tight and heavy, but Cai Guoqiang has always strictly controlled the quality, and often takes into account details. ""Involved in professional issues or engineering quality, Cai Guoqiang will become very strong. When he encounters the problem, he can give him a contradiction point and point out a solution."" Cai Guoqiang will take a serious look at each process. Before the acceptance, he saw that the corners of the separation partition were relatively sharp, so he asked to buy some corner suits to avoid scratching the patient. Recently, Cai Guoqiang has appeared at the site of Chongming Temporary Isolation Housing Projects in P1 and P2 parking lots in Chongming Flower Expo Park. This is the 56th emergency isolation facility project participating in construction in the past month in the past month.

Space,Goodwill is Light,Space,"Zhang Huimin still remembers one day before the building closed, and encountered the uncle of Room 03 in the corridor. He was holding a big green onion in his hand. I asked him if he bought so much onion? He said that he was his birthday. The daughter's family of three came to eat noodles. He was preparing to burn the scallion and bake the scallops, and he also prepared a lot of dishes they like. The uncle also said that the filial daughter ordered a big cake for him, and he will be distributed to the old partners who meet every day to enjoy with our neighbors on this floor tomorrow. Where did you think that, shortly after entering the house, the No. 8 Building received a notice of closed management. Fortunately, the residents had already been prepared for the sealing control of the epidemic district, and it was not surprising. It's just that the sealing means that it is not enough to go home. When do you do nucleic acid, when the garbage goes out, and where to accept the courier ... The transmission of many sounds must have a channel source. I first joined the large group of 300 people in the community. I always thought that with this group, I could receive information on the community. But after a while, I found that it was not right: some notifications issued by Building 8 had shouted by the granddaughter of Room 06 through the back balcony of our two, and I didn't know. She asked me if you were in the group? I said it was added. She also wondered, saying that let my daughter take a look, which group do you join? Watching the girl's fingers touched the mobile phone keyboard's fingers like the speed of abacus competition, I couldn't help but think that when the two of us moved more than ten years ago, the girl was still in her mother's belly. Make people sigh. The little girl pulled me into the newly -built Building 8 of nearly 200 people's temporary epidemic prevention groups. I always think that current students do not care about things that have nothing to do with themselves. In fact, their hearts are also full of goodwill. In this temporary group, I saw that although the girl couldn't go out of the house, she was working hard as the elders: to answer some of the confusion of the neighbors, to reply to the question of foreign neighbors in English, and I felt warm. The hardest time in closed days is undoubtedly volunteer. In order to ensure that each neighbor can successfully present the QR code during the test of nucleic acid testing, they have taken a screenshot of the family, and they do it for the elderly who cannot operate. The distribution of antigen reagents, each each of them distributed and explained the essentials. The dry and wet garbage during the sealing period was collected uniformly ... I know he and her are my neighbors, but I don't know them. When knocking on the door distributing items, I sincerely want to say a few words of gratitude, but how can the ""big blue"" have time to greet them, they have tasks, and they cannot make mistakes. Orderly testing requires reasonable arrangements. What organization floor personnel, line layout, elevator elimination and other complications are complicated. If they are not formulating the plan, it must be disorderly. This hard work and fatigue can be imagined. A group of nearly 200 people naturally has a variety of character. Some people even blame volunteers in the group because they waited for nucleic acid when they went downstairs. The group is not a place of quarrel. The residents used actions to refute: one sentence after another expressed gratitude to the volunteers and the hard -working words became a long dragon. It is clear that no perfect homework can be copied in this special period. Only in practice continuously explore and summarize the best solution. Residents cannot see people who do not stand back pain! The uncle in Room 03 was nearly seventy -year -old uncle shouted in the group: You need to call it, let's help. A few days ago, through the window, I saw these neighborhood cadres, property personnel and volunteers dripping the rain, and carried a bag of vegetables with a bag of vegetables with vegetables from outside the door. 174 households. This is definitely a physical work. They are dripping on their bodies. Can't tell whether it is rain or sweat? The epidemic reflects the hearts and feelings of humanity, and releases the goodwill in our hearts. Although I still don't know the volunteers of Building 8 so far, maybe we still pass by in the future and have not handled it, but you are the reassurance of the residents, and I deeply feel it. Uncle 03 Uncle Room could not be delivered because of seal control, but I was convinced that he must engrave the unforgettable birthday in his life. The epidemic prevented people appreciate the bright spring, but one day I opened the door, and I suddenly found that there were a few pots of green plants in the corridor. It was moved out of the 05 room couple from her own. This is the green of spring, not far from spring.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-28/7.htm,4/28/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,

On that day, when a 90 -year -old veterans were lying on the bed when he was sampled to the citizen at Leye Community. After accepting the sampling of nucleic acid, he saluted his teammates, and his wife also bowed thanks. In Hecheng Apartment, a little girl sent us the painting drawn to us. The flowers surrounded by flowers, and the ""big white"" smiled to make a victory gesture, with ""Shanghai refueling"" on the picture. From these small details, we feel the goodwill and warmth of Shanghai citizens, and we seem to have no fatigue. At 5 am on April 6th, I was still confused.

Similar situations that support corporate customers supply chain flow and Jinshan Fengjing Town Cooperative are that the industries of sugarcane planting farmers thousands of miles away from Guangxi, Yunnan and other places have also grown up under the pouring of financial live water. A subsidiary of a group company has long been engaged in sucrose production and sales for a long time, and needs to be purchased from time to time. Most of the raw materials are purchased in provinces with more sugar cane in Guangxi and Yunnan.

Space,May everyone find their own heart flow,Space,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, Sun Wen has more time to read and think. I have found it online, offline, ancient, modern, Chinese and foreign books. Reading is indeed a very pleasant thing, because there are many places, many humanities, and many times. You cannot walk one by one. These records or texts can bring you to such an environment, One is in imagination. The concept of Xinliu was heard in the training class of FIFA. At the earliest, a book ""Heart Stream"" written by American psychologists ""Heart Stream"", which is very important, is that in the process of human progress and reproduction, human beings not only have some physiological selection for nature to choose naturally. Need, that is, the so -called sensory enjoyment and the need for happiness, which is of course nothing, but that is not our ultimate goal. These happiness brought by color, taste, sound, incense, etc. must be fleeting. You will still have a sense of disorder, you will not get peace, you will feel anxious. The highest sense of people is immersed in the experience of heart flow. Of course, this experience has a clear definition, that is, there must be clear goals, timely feedback, devoted to devoting to the sense of control and skills that are continuously enhanced, and finally obtained a kind of forgetful experience. After reading it, I realized that many people said that the women's football team had no money, no rewards, and suffering, etc. Why can I persist? It was difficult to explain the ultimate experience with them at the time. Today, I can explain well. Many things are not exchanged for money, just like we can get experience in football in the process of football, as we have mentioned in the process of football. This is a process of heart flow caused by love. ""Heart Stream"" is a guide to improving happiness and efficiency. It is an experience of self -growth. Choose a goal, devote all attention, focus on nothing, no matter what you do, once we realize that this matter brings happiness, we will double the effort and form the formation of the cycle. Self -growth began. If we can be very lucky to get the heart, it is really a very happy and happy thing. I think I am very lucky. I hope everyone can find such a flow experience and get a sense of happiness of a positive life.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/7.htm,4/29/22,,
Space,The art of life lies in the match,Space,"Xu Fangjie's weather is getting warmer, suitable for flowering flowers, eating spring bamboo shoots, broad beans and spinach. However, at the moment, closure of home, materials are tense than ever, and common and easy -to -preserve foods such as potatoes and onions have become extremely precious. My mother prepares three meals a day, and the ingredients of not many at home can always match different tricks in her hands. At six o'clock in dinner, the mother started preparing at four:30. After a while, in the plates, the green and yellow were washed clean, and the cut, packed, and waiting quietly for cooking. Ready to burn a spinach soup, there is no preserved egg, and the mother puts a few shrimp. The soup is so bad. I took a sip and praised: ""This is really the taste of spring!"" She also stewed a rib The corn, just yesterday, there was one section of the ravioli left yesterday, so the pink coriander stewed pork ribs and ate two crickets. There is a plate of dried shreds. Without coriander and carrots, the mother put sesame sauce and other seasonings, and it is still eaten by us. I often feel that my mother has a pair of magician -like hands, and she is freely matched. Whether it is eating or dressing, it seems casual but unified. I remember when I was very young, I followed my mother and looked at her to buy food and go to the department store. No matter what, I could always find another match. The New Year is undoubtedly the most anticipated thing when we were young. Moms prepared new clothes for us early, and they were well -matched. We had prepared food during the Chinese New Year and celebrated the harvest of one year. In the slow home time, maybe put the time on the most common meals and dress in order to feel the beauty and simplicity of life from the inside out. We can also find the fun of life. And this ability to match it takes time to cultivate. Only by forming your own feelings and understanding of life and beauty can you match your own personality and taste. This taste that is brewed in the match may be the taste of life and the taste of the world. When there is no rich supplies, people need to be carefully calculated and coordinated. With a table of meals, it not only requires ingredients, but also a mind that is willing to pay. Mother often said: ""Keeping the stoves, keeping the happiness of the family."" Now under the epidemic, the food that is paired with a table can soothe people's anxious and panic. ""Dressing and eating is human physics."" ""Matching"" another meaning is to cherish. The mother of the mother, living in the era of relatively scarce supplies, has developed a frugal habit, and she can use it. The ingredients on the corners of the edge can be stewed into a pot, but also hook into a woolen bag. Today, the supplies are rich. If who saves some water and electricity in life and saves some leftovers and bread, it may attract some questions. Perhaps for a long time, we have become accustomed to this life. The richness of food inevitably caused a lot of waste. In the future, we will definitely encounter different forms of difficulties. In front of natural things, we must learn to save savings And cherish, learn equality and respect. The epidemic will eventually pass, and we will definitely win the final victory, but the problems left to us are worthy of many people to reflect and study. From an individual, a person who will spend his mind, match, and cherish it in life must have already penetrated the mystery of life art. If we encounter similar difficulties again, we will have more experience and wisdom, clean up our mood, protect our homes, and play a good life.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/8.htm,4/29/22,8th edition: Nightlight Cup,

Space,Also said two meals,Space,"Hu Zhanfen's friends have been arguing with me many times, and they have two meals. He claimed to be ""two meals"", and seemed to have joined any ""Xunye"", a very high -light meteorological, this book is all necessary. During the epidemic, the dining table was abundant. Talking about the health superiority of the second meal and said that ""the ancients are two meals"", the meaning of the words is ""excellent tradition"", which is not aggressive. It is like the home of the house for a long time and the hair is long. Is it interesting? However, debate has always been promoted. First of all, when the ancients ""ancient, when is the ancient"" ancient ""? After testing, the ""two meals"" are the oldest, and the ""institutional"" is still the Yin and Shang Dynasty, it is too ancient. Oracle often has ""big food"" and ""snacks"". According to the exam, it refers to the two meals of the dynasty and night in the day, which is equivalent to the current breakfast and dinner. The aristocratic activities, the nobles are still ""two meals"", and civilians cannot have more luxurious three meals. ""Mihuli Rimi is less"", at that time, the productive forces were low. The farm tools were either wood or bones, such as wood plowstone shovel bone bone, most of them were manpower. How many outputs can you expect in the place? ""Zhou Li · 膳"" is recorded in ""Wang Ri"". As a result, it is to kill the animal. Zheng Xuan in the Eastern Han Dynasty explained that Zhou Wang had to bite (kill the animal) every day, but Chinese meal and dinner no longer kill new animals, but to eat the leftovers of breakfast. At least, this at least It shows that in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, there were three meals a day. From the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the general application of iron agricultural tools made productivity more leaps, and there were more food. Then, the ""three meals system"" was established in the whole society. The later ""Warring States Policy"" ""Guan Yan offended Qi"" chapter ""Guan Yan offended Qi"" has the words ""San San Food, and Jun Goose Radio"", which means that you can not eat the goose and duck feed you raised, and your diners But I ca n’t eat three meals a day. Obviously, the ""diners"" during the Warring States Period include Feng Yan under the door of Meng Tajun, all of which were made of three meals a day, and the latter was ""eating without fish"". Check ""Zhuangzi · Xiaoyaoyou"": ""Those who are suitable for reckless Cang, three meals are reversed, and the belly is still true."" It means that if the outing is out, as long as you need to prepare three meals, you will not be hungry. It also shows that people use three meals as a practice. In the Han Dynasty, people also gave a special name to three meals a day. Breakfast was called ""饔"", lunch was called ""sHANG"", dinner was ""飧"" (sound ""Sun""), ""Said"" ""SHANG"", and the day. The pronunciation is the same as ""晌"", which refers to lunch. It can be seen that below the pre -Qin Dynasty, the Han Dynasty, the Song and Yuan dynasties, the habit of three meals a day has long been established and common. Naturally, this refers to the normal market society. It is lucky to have a meal a day, let alone ""three meals"" and ""two meals""? Friend's theory, lost in ""all two meals"", is arbitrary. As for whether the ""two meals"" have the superiority of health, it is completely different from the time. My honey knows that it is not a cream? It is rumored that in the hands of Zhu Yuanzhang, the ""two meals"" almost became a system, saying that after he was in his place, he seemed to have advocated ""not eating at noon"". It has been flat, there is nothing wrong with the country. In addition to the reward, it is suitable to save the floating costs. ""It just advocates the good atmosphere of clean government and frugality. The problem is that the poor only eat two meals for helplessness. The monks only eat two meals for practice. You can advocate integrity above you, but ""integrity"" is only two meals a day. It should be noted that the so -called early dynasty is to get up in the early morning and enter the palace class at 4 am. Because it is an empty stomach overnight, many people not only can't stand the stomach, but also ""low blood sugar"". It can be eaten after 7 ~ 8 o'clock. The concept of noon is from 11:00 to 13:00, and the more than ten hours of lunch from 12 o'clock from lunch will have an empty stomach again. There are similar rules. The Zilong Sun Ru Zhu Xi Zhu Quanzheng and the king of Zhu Xi, and the later Xuanzong Yingzong Wuzong and the like, can obey the ancestral training and not shouting, so Zhu Yuanzhang really has similar will. And the chaos should be unsuccessful. In the end of Mingming, isn't the three meals still ""three -day meals""? Between the imperial decree and the body, of course, the body is more honest. A simple reason is that the energy you take at noon can make you survive the bullshit. In the lazy afternoon, pass through the long night until the next morning? Besides, the old farmers fell asleep at 7 pm, and your ""nightlife"" started at 7 o'clock in the evening. The skin is white for a long time, and it must be repeated, just just talk about the paleness and the elegant beauty of the hair ""?

Space,Pay tribute to workers who dedicate to the country,Space,"Yu Yi today is the May Day Labor Day. My old teacher who was carrying a long -term backward congratulations to the workers and the workers who struggled to the front line of the resistance. In the new era, inheritance and promotion of the spirit of model workers, the spirit of labor, the spirit of craftsmanship is particularly important. For a century, the spirit of the model workers has been a valuable spiritual wealth created by the party's leadership for tens of millions of labor models, and hard work and hard work to build the country to benefit the people. With such a spiritual wealth, the spine bones will be straight, and their hearts will be widened. Taking the ordinary work as an important organic part of the great cause of the motherland will dedicate infinite wisdom and endless power. I am a teacher, from ignorance to maturity, that is, persistently studying a generation of labor models such as Wang Jinxi, Achigo, Huang Baomei, Bao Qiyan, etc., absorb valuable mental materials from them, strive to reflect on themselves, transform themselves, improve yourself, self -improvement , Gradually refine the power of loyalty to the party's career and strengthen the ability to serve the people. For this reason, I have been deeply respectful and grateful for Shanghai model workers and national model workers. I am pleased to see that many platforms that are provided to the model of labor today in Shanghai are not only leading the model workers to continue their studies, and in the new long journey, it is more brilliant. The spirit of model workers with Chinese characteristics, the spirit of labor, and craftsmanship not only converts the spirit into material power, but also enlighten students to educate and inspire them to grow up healthy. It is significant. Workers create material wealth and spiritual wealth, and struggle can only be powerful. Nowadays, the epidemic in Shanghai is affecting everyone's hearts. We must carry forward the spirit of struggle and hard work, and overcome temporary difficulties through hard work and work. Struggle can overcome difficulties, create fruitful learning results, and struggle will definitely create the glory of the construction cause, and pay tribute to workers who are dedicated to the country.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-01/7.htm,5/1/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,
Space,Fengde Garden,Space,"Zhang Ye is suitable for maturity with age, and should contain the attention of different things around him, and the touch and perception of the ""material level"" he has experienced. Qiuxiapu also appeared in my novels, but it was just a background ""campus"", and it did not have its own independent form. Some of the strange stone names that once -named the surname were even more impressive in my memory. Now when I see them again, in the feeling of the next generation, they seem to have nothing to do with me. They have their own appearances and their own stories. They have not tasted because of the memory of the guests around me. What I want to say is that in personal growth memory, the impression of the environment will have a significant ""error"". I am afraid it is also a characteristic of our generation. And values. After writing a number of novels about growth by myself, I will inevitably ask now, as I wrote, what I experienced is what I do and perceive? Of course, I will also ask. For example, in front of the Jiading Confucian Temple, the 72 ancient stone lions on the top of the stone railings of the three -torrent of education, Yang Gao, and Xingxian, which were once sealed by ""more than this"", are not worthwhile to believe that it is true. ? Today, when my concern often falls on the things that have been ""missed"" around me, my eyes always show some kind of movement from time to time, and it seems unbearable. I wrote a granitar Pavilion, which was built here from the ancient road outside the city more than 40 years ago in the Humblewen ""Huilongtan"" for centuries. Create a tenon -and -mortise structure, the top of Xieshan and the roof ridge carving. In front of it, I will reach out from time to time and touch it, and I can't tell anything. Not to mention the 72 little stone lions and two big stone lions in front of the Confucius Temple door. There are many texts about them, and each place will use ""lifelike and different expressions."" The big stone lion's legs and feet, I do not know how many hands were touched, and it has become light and jade. These production not only has no practicality, but also exceeds the form of concepts, becoming a magical existence: When we reach out and touch them, we are actually touching the face of history and the temperature of the ancestors. Needless to say, in the age of their birth, they are already artworks that are clever, but we don't know who their authors are. The artwork is completed, and the artists have disappeared. Flou said similar words: showing art, retreating artists. In my life experience, the place of departure and the return point are all related to Jiangnan Garden. One is the ""Qiuxia Garden"" of the old garden, and the other end is one of the round table dialogue meetings of the 2019 Second Yangtze River Delta Classical Garden Cultural Forum Round Table Dialogue Conference. New Garden Fengde Garden. Once a ignorant student, now he is a ""retreat"" passenger. The arrangement of this fate seems to give me a chance to make up for the ""missed"". However, on the other hand, I am lucky and often think secretly. How can I not miss the evening scene of this ""uniqueness here""? Especially when I have accumulated too much, I know how to sigh for the superb traditional craftsmanship. As an attempt to make a garden today, Fengde Garden also shows extraordinary accomplishments, such as complicated and exquisite craftsmanship, exquisite and gorgeous plums, the ceiling structure, such as thousands of weather and lifelike brick carving walls. Fortunately, I can easily see their producers. Needless to say, they are all ordinary ""craftsmen"", and they don't think ""artists"": when the ""name"" and ""seal"" of today's artists are important, they are still ""showing art"". Then, according to this logic, after a few years, no one will know them about this garden. I have also read some ancient gardens, and there are indeed few records about ""craftsmen"". If it is said that this is a ""negligence"" of the authors of the garden in the past, then there is no choice but it has become a viewpoint that I can't get around today. From this point of view, it is easy to see a group, with the best skills and obscurity. Its ""past life and present life"" corresponds to the long history of local culture and life.

""Some neighbors said:"" You chased the two days in the past two days, Xiao Xue didn't say a voice, do you know what he did? Do you know a major event in other communities? ""It turned out that the neighborhood committee had to control five or six communities. There is a small hotel in the noodle room of a certain Jingyuan Street. Hundreds of residents did not do this time, and they were shouting that Xiao Xue explained the situation and immediately ""unplugged"". Imagine, can it be the general department that can set up the transit station here? And Xiao Xue, the director of the neighborhood committee, is the most grass -roots cadre. Can he unplug this point? In those two days, Xiao Xue was scattered and only slept in the office for two or three hours a day. Several communities were entangled with him, and the task above pressed him again, especially the residents of a certain Jingyuan pulled him, babbling his chest, and asked him to ""solve the problem immediately."" At the end of the matter, Xiao Xue also went out, and everything tried everything to find the leadership, and it was entangled. He thought that as long as the purpose of ""people first"" and ""life first"" was recognized, it was not a sorry that the director lost. In the end, he really wished: ""Transit Station"" was withdrawn from the residential area ... When the neighbors heard this, when they met Xiao Xue, they had a sense of imposing. The ""transit station"" has been on the Internet, and it is famous in Shanghai. They did not expect that this hard bone was taken off by Xiao Xue! But in the community group, Xiao Xue's forced question continued. One day I really couldn't see it, and on WeChat: ""The owners were so tight in the transshipment of a positive patient. Would you like to help you to help you?"" He replied: ""Thank you Teacher Peng! The meeting, it's almost! ""Sure enough, the next morning, the neighbors saw that the gate of the community was rare. A ambulance flashed the police lamp and stopped to the door of the positive infection. The group immediately spread: ""The transshipment car is here! The neighborhood committee said that three patients are going to be transported away today!"" Another day, everyone received a notice saying that today's nucleic acid testing, everyone can wait at the door of the house with peace of mind, no need to come out again, no need to come out again Line in line. In the doubt, the four yellow battery cars drove out. Each car carried two doctors, and slowly drove to each door for samples one by one. These four sample vehicles were changed by Xiaoxue's organizational and overtime, and the risk of gathering nucleic acid detection suddenly reduced a lot. Several communities under the residential committee, most of them have become enviable ""preventive areas"" at the end of April. But the epidemic was undulating, the public mouth was difficult, and Xiao Xue was still at the forefront. The work of labor is here, and the anti -epidemic is working hard to climb.

Chidu Jiading Temporary Isolation House Project,85 hours completes half a month of workload,Space,"When I learned that I won the National May Day Labor Medal in 2022, Huang Huichong, the electrician head of Shanghai Mingfu Construction and Installation Engineering Co., Ltd., was a little surprised: ""I am a job, and I thought someone was joking with me. The more I believe, I believe it. ""In the eyes of the workers, Huang Huichong is a solid, willing and reliable migrant worker brother. He has participated in a large number of major municipal projects such as Shanghai Disney and Shanghai Guangyuan Phase II project. During this year's epidemic, he led more than 10 members of the team to help Jiading's temporary quarantine house project, and used hard work to solve many problems and successfully completed the task. Each moment was an emergency sprint on April 7th. Huang Huichong, who persisted in the Shanghai Disney site, received an instructions from Chi Ai Jiading's temporary isolation room. He led the assault team to rush to the scene quickly. Faced with the installation and debugging tasks of all intelligent and weak electricity in the three areas of more than 800 areolation board rooms, the original half -month workload was only 85 hours for them. Huang Hui rushed around the venue several times, and found that the outdoor pipe roads were complicated, which means that they must be careful when laying the indoor laying. He took the initiative to optimize the plan with the designer, re -organized the original pipeline of the indoor to ensure the basic living needs, and greatly improved the project efficiency. As the sharp knife team of the Shanghai Construction Work Installation Group, Huang Huichong's team participated in the deepest feeling of the Jiading project: each moment is an ""emergency sprint"", and every second is ""constant to change."" One isolated for the laying of weak electricity in the board room, you need to go through multiple steps such as installing line boxes, pipe connection, line laying, equipment terminal wiring installation, and system debugging. For Huang Huiying, these links have been done thousands of times earlier, and technical methods are familiar. ""Even so, I am still very cautious during the paving process, for fear that a small link error will cause the project to delay."" One by one, a sudden day and night, Huang Huichong, who had just completed a separate board room shop, received a team member from the team members. ""Help"". The area where the player is located has been paved, and the model room can be ""accepted"" almost. The situation can be connected to the line during debugging. Some video surveillance is out of power, and some cannot receive signals. Huang Huiyong rushed to the scene to check that because the time was tight, the line number labeling and the equipment number were not confronted, and the humid weather made the marking pen marking very blurred, and the handwriting was difficult to distinguish. ""At that time, only one root could be returned."" Huang Huichong began to check from the inner quarantine board room, and picked up the wiring instrument and the marking pen to re -marked the label. To confirm whether the connection of each line is ""smooth"". After debugging one by one, the indicator lights on the switches in the weak electric room lit up, and Huang Huiying knew that the lines were all through. He couldn't remember how many times he resolved the problem. Compared with the intensity of work, Huang Huiying also helps workers to overcome the fear and worry. ""The team members are somewhat worried during the construction process. They are worried that they are not worried that they will not be handed over on time, but they are also infected."" Huang Huichun said that he divided the team into two groups of cross -handling operations to ensure that 24 hours of interruption and let everyone have a break. At the same time, they kept telling them to wear a mask to do their own protection. In the end, 85 hours, thousands of wires, the Jiading temporary isolation room intelligent and weak electricity installation project that had been completed in half a month, under the overtime sprint led by Huang Huichong, was successfully completed. At present, Huang Huichun and the workers have entered the isolation point to rest, waiting for the next job notice.

Space ,The whole world will give you a way ,"—— ""Walking in the World"" twenty -one ","In Yu Tianbai's walking heaven and earth, he always feels that there is a sacred place that makes the whole world a way to make the road. This feeling comes from a famous saying in the ideological and literary circles of ""On Nature"" and ""Life"": ""When you strengthen your choice, the whole world will give you a way."" The most precious thing in the world is life. When you choose your love for life, the world will give way! Undoubtedly, the volcano is one of the most powerful killers in disabled. I have not witnessed its tyrannical, but I have been destroyed more than once, for example, the super volcano, the American Yellowstone Park, which is known as the largest gunpowder barrel on the planet, the ""hot sea"" of Tengchong in western Yunnan, Ma'ansling in Hainan Island, Changbai Mountain Tianchi, Wu Dadianchi in Heilongjiang and so on. The most unforgettable taught me is the five Dalianchi. It was the only living volcano group in China, the crater, which is known as the ""Old Black Mountain"", and the last eruption was in the 1930s. It erupted the rampant rampant at that moment, destroying the soul, and the brutal and crazy traces of tearing the earth, still shocked me. This mouth with a diameter of more than 300 meters and a depth of more than 140 meters is to melt with unimaginable high temperatures. Facing this inverted pits, the madness of how the fiery red magma seen from the film and television comes out of my eyes will be reproduced in front of my eyes. The eruption will end. The near -mouth magma slowly condenses without spraying. The gravel baked by the flames rolled down from the surroundings, and the honeycomb -like volcanic solution condensed, which accumulated into this steep wall. The earth, left such a ""scar"" that extended several kilometers to the surrounding area: it is a ""ink mud"" made by the accumulation of volcanic gray soil that has been burned by flames ... It is a rock condensed in the flowing lava. It is dark black, with blue light, and the flow is endless. A few bodies lakes! The most shocking is the scene presented by ""Shilong"". ""Shilong"" refers to the dragon black magma that is made of a dragon -shaped black magma from the stone dragon river from the flow of the magma. It was a large space with a few miles. The path we take is opened in the meantime. The ""stone sea"" condensed by the left and right magma is vast and vast, ripple -shaped, such as plows over the land, such as pillars, such as monuments, such as Kan, such as Mausoleum; Some are like water patterns, some are like vortexes, some like ruts, some are like twist, some are like dragon snakes, some are like beef and horses, and some are like cooking cake stoves, big tips and large, hollow like bamboo, and therefore The underground tunnel appeared, which was opened for tourists to watch the water curtain cave and the fairy palace ... Obviously, the moment the flame eruption, magma running, and destroying it wanted to destroy, thermal expansion and contraction, the surface condensed into a rock shell, but was being being stained, but it was by the rock shell, but it was by the surface. The molten molten that is still flowing below is broken, breaking through, and the accumulation has become such a messy accumulation. Today, more than 200 years later, it still refuses to absorb the sun. The people walk on it. Intersection My heart was shocked by a sacred sense at that time! This is the many greens that appear in this coke. On some rocks, there are some shrubs with small porn fern and round leaflets. Little family jasper, such as bonsai; some lava, covered with cyan -white moss, dotted with small and beautiful stone flowers. Display vitality. The most amazing thing is the cricket trees, birch trees, especially the cricket trees. They actually chose to grow vigorously in the galloped gaps that experienced such a catastrophe. It can be imagined that at first, the seeds that came with the wind were in the depression of the magma condensate or in the narrow rock gap. Efforts to pull up, get the rain dew and sunlight, step by step, unyieldingly cover the scorch soil, hoping to give the world a vibrant green, just like the saddles that erupted 10,000 years ago, the ""wound"" was repaired with lush life! You see, in this big land, she suffers from all kinds of unimaginable insults and destruction. In order not to lose the perfection and dignity of the mother of all things, regardless of the power of the volcanic, the devastation of the destruction, and resolutely moved to a grain of dust and sand with the help of the wind. The month, the dynasty, the perseverance to repair itself, silently occupy each seam, every pit that can be kept in dust, and each of the seeds with life like a tree with a tree that follows. The world uses green and hope to resist the rules of irresistible, so the whole world gives her way for her choice! Isn't it all in front of you? This can't help but teach me that the COVID-19 virus is raging this reality. For more than two years, countless stories in this disaster to fight against this disaster, isn't it because of choosing to love life. Does the whole world make the perfect way? Each variant of the virus, every time it is crazy, is nothing more than a new interpretation of this law of survival, new confirmation, new test! Firmly do everything he can, for others, for yourself, for the whole human beings, love life, and love life, the virus and epidemic will definitely give way for the sacred choice of human beings!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/7.htm,5/2/22,Edition 7: Nightlight Cup ,
Space,Do you know we are thinking of you,Space,"Tong Zirong April 25, 1992, this is a day when the translator will never forget. Thirty years ago on this day, a legendary old man who led a group of voice actors to create more than forty years -Mr. Chen Xuyi, the head of the head of the ""behind the scenes"", resigned. Old man Chen, who has graduated from St. John's University and has been working hard at Master Zuo Lin. ""But he still came to the factory in the face, and he fascinated with his handwriting to help the translation as a Taiwanese book. This situation is a touching scene left by the elderly. When the old man was more unforgettable, his eyes were unable to open, and the hearing was almost lost, but his left finger still moved subconsciously. Later! Thirty years have passed, even in the usual days, we will emerge from time to time from time to time, and our old man is dedicated to work. This innocent, bright and bright man, neither cares about the name nor the benefit. The only thing that cares about is to get the greatest happiness and happiness in the creative labor of the book. Today, not to mention his extraordinary accomplishments, but focus on his character. It is funny to say that the actors who came from Shangying from Shangying really loved and hate our factory. What you love is to get out of the cattle and sheep shed, you can also watch foreign films and engage in the dubbing business; what hates is that, like a military camp, when you arrive at eight o'clock, you must enter the shed with a play and throat. And some of them are free to scattered. Where can I suffer such sins? However, they were as used to the same as us, but they felt very proud. Behind this, first because our old man, the old man Chen, made an example. He is like a iron man. At least half an hour in advance ride the ""old tank"" into the factory every day in advance, and then he starts the inspections of various departments. It is not difficult a day or two days, so 365 days, can you do it? Compared with the strict discipline, the stricter is the requirements for work quality. The most impressive is the word ""work"". In the reception hall, ""Everyday I want to work hard"" a few shining words, reminding us at all times, urging us. I have been in the translation factory for thirty years, and have never been praised by him, and others are almost the same. The phrase ""That's it"" is a disguised praise, because his understanding, perception, and judgment can be described as Superman, and our dubbing cannot reach a full score at all. I am ""unprecedented"". The stupid bird first flys, and even the running dragon set also uses it. In five years, I have worked hard for five years. This is not an exaggeration. He looked at it, just appreciated, so as soon as the heat arrived, let me try to match the main role and continuously give me the opportunity. The old man Chen himself took the lead in work. We all saw him as a book day and night. Those classic films, such as the wonderful dialogue in ""Prince's Revenge"", ""Jane · Love"", ""Voice of Music"", etc., can be said to be exchanged for his talents with his talents and his life. Speaking of this, I immediately associate the famous paragraph that happened to him. If this small detail is not a joke, we can still imagine that the old man Chen was absent from his heart because he tapped a stunts. Wash your feet in the foot basin, and more than once. A small limb movement reflects what a great lack of arms! In the translation factory, our old factory director has mastered the ""killing power"", and the list of the dubbing characters is determined by him. The actor arranged properly, and the dubbing was half successful. We are convinced and admired his artistic judgment. Of course, for the purpose of cultivation, sometimes it is also risky, such as letting me go with Colonel Bochl in ""Princess Sissi"" and the narration of ""The Story of the Fox"". And the bad villain in the bones in ""Wild Mai Ridge"", he would not let me try it easily. It is said that there is no need to use the right and expires to be invalidated. Putting on the old factory director scoffed at it. He is like giving the business off, and the control of leadership management is equally strict, even more strict, and a small specialization will not be stained. He has the most beloved daughter, and looks very similar to him. We are strange why she has always been at home. Arrange her into the factory, where to find a job, there is no need to speak like this, just nodded. But he just didn't express his statement, and he was not allowed to be blind. Until the policy, she could be arranged legally, so she came to the translation factory to report, and she went to an ordinary workshop that had nothing to do with fat. ""Everything starts from work"" is his unshakable creed, so he dares to ""commit"". It is easy to talk about it, not only to make us students sincerely admire, but also squeeze a sweat for him. Here is a story. The old factory was older every day. Who will pick up his class, he naturally has considerations and strategies, and the scope of consideration is also in the factory. Who knew that the instructions had been rigid, and the old factory director had to clarify the showdown. From then on, his business was as usual, and the administrative aspect would never cooperate. Fortunately, it didn't take long for things to change. A storm was ended in a stunned manner. This selfless and fearless old man is not afraid of anything, but it turns out that his seeing and employment is completely right. Now the translator is still thinking hard, hard work, and hopes that the translation business will reproduce the prosperous situation. When we are a student, we are willing to follow Mr. Chen Xuyi with the eagerness and support of the fans and friends, and will never fight on the position of the translation.

In May, it is a rare peak sales season for the zongzi industry. At this time in previous years, it was already produced in the day and night. At the highest peak, 30,000 dumplings could be produced a day. Last year, nearly 1 million were produced.

(hereinafter referred to as ""Schneider Industrial Control"") Practical. Along with Shanghai's implementation of the ""three districts"" partitional grading differentiation prevention and control management, the company has recently resumed the production line.

Qiao Weixin said The outer warehouse has long been in the closed management period. ""On the one hand, production cannot be stopped, and on the other hand, there is no enough storage space for goods."" This is the most difficult thing for Qiao Weixin before closed production.

The residents exploded and stared at Zhu Qiuxia. ""We ask for disinfecting three times a day, it takes professional!"" ""We have more elderly people, few young volunteers, and no one should do what to do?"" She appeased the residents and wanted to have a video of a senior high school daughter who hadn't connected for two days. At first glance, she could only stop at 1 am the next day.

Although she couldn't rest assured, the prevention work in the residential area was inseparable from her. She said: ""My own difficulties solve it by myself. Over the problem, my daughter still has a meal to eat for her, at least I can't be hungry, but there are many elderly people who live in alone. There are no children around. There are 9 communities in the residential area of Zhangjiazhai, nearly 3,000, and the office of the neighborhood committee is located in Yanwu Electromechanical Building. Insufficient manpower is the biggest problem that Zhu Qiuxia is facing. After two social workers in the neighborhood committee were confirmed, the rest of the people were isolated in the Yanwu Electrical and Electrical Building.

The peripherals of the neighborhood committee mainly depend on the sinking cadres and volunteers of the street. Everyone is very hard."" Zhu Qiuxia said.

Some residents sent her supplies to find her in the middle of the night. The pregnant woman's amniotic fluid broke her. She would also find her if she was resentful ... The resident said that she would have to call 12345 complaints. It is reasonable to be a professional and disinfect, and the neighborhood committee finds a way to solve it. Secondly, for the problem of not reaching the number of group purchases, she suggested that she would consolidate the purchase with a community next to her. Third, for express delivery, the residents can be sent to a nearby shop owner, and then the neighborhood committee mobilize the boss to help solve the ""last 100 meters"". She said: ""I can understand the mood of the residents, and I always try to help them, but sometimes I really can't be too busy, and I hope the residents can understand it."" Every night, Zhu Qiuxia try to arrange everyone to sleep as much as possible. In the activity room, she sleeps in the office and can answer the phone at any time. ""I am the oldest. Others have done a lot of physical work during the day and take care of me. I try to rest as much as possible at night. matter"". She said that she basically notified the nucleic acid time during the day at 2 or three in the morning. After receiving the notice, she would have to notify the volunteer group before she could sleep. At 7 o'clock in the morning, you have to get up for preparations. At 7:30, you must start to measure acid. You often have no time to eat breakfast, or you can only cope with it. If you want to video with your daughter, you always forget to forget, think too late ""! Zhu Qiuxia usually does not have time to grab food at home. A few days ago, she just saw that a resident grabbed McDonald's online, and also took out her mobile phone and tried it. She did not expect to grab her daughter a order. She was very happy.

Space,Old driver of tram -free tram,Space,"A little girl from Ma Shanglong graduated from middle school and distributed three times to the tram. He became a 26 -way tram driver. He passed from the Bund to Xujiahui every day, passed by Huaihai Road, opened seven and a half laps, and got off work. It is really a good job in the ceiling when the forehead. ""Graduation and distribution of middle schools"", these words are matched together, which is a scene 50 years ago. The little girl was very happy. The neighbors also said that she was lucky, but there was an uncle in the hall and the uncle in the hall came in: Isonly a trackless tram? Ah, the trackless tram has no track, and can be disrupted, called as a randomly -driving tram ... The uncle is energy, and the little girl tears will fall down: what to do! Who is driving a trackless tram! Undoubtedly, ""turning on a trackless tram"" is not a good thing. Driving the trackless tram is to be criticized -things that are widely criticized must also be widespread things. It is often time to discuss meetings and discuss it. Unconsciously, it is said that it has nothing to do with the theme. Talking about the avenue, passing the trails, joking, granting the tricks of picking flowers, secretly rumoring the husband's way of taming the husband ... The non -orbit tram drives up. Everyone is an old driver, and the track -free tram is always farther and farther. Until the team leader patted the table: Good brakes! Back to the theme of destroying the four harms! Many years later, I pondered the cause of ""randomly driving tram"". The most wrongdoing is not a little girl who is a driver on the trackless tram, but a trackless tram. Who does the tram offender be offended? If a tram is spiritual, it should be strongly required to restore reputation. No tram -free tram students can also be said in turn. In the era of random driving trams, it coincided with the era when track -free trams began to replace trams in Shanghai. On June 1, 1960, the tram on the Huaihai Road also drove to the end. It was replaced by the 26 -way tram. The cost of non -rail -free trams was low and the fare was cheaper than the car. The starting price was 4 points. This ""one time"" is the most dense period of the conference. Lane was going to meet, the group had to meet, the workshop had to meet, and Tian Tou had to meet ... It is impossible to verify, who gives a meeting to discuss the extremely vivid life -driving a trackless tram. This ""one time"" is also a period of heat in the society. Many things are not superstitious about social conclusions, determined to break the old rules and regulations, and make their heads. However, as soon as I did it, I went out of the ocean. In this way, the significance of sublimating tram: In Shanghai, everything is feasible, and everything is available. The trackless tram is track, but two long braids are long and connected to overhead wires. On the road, I saw that the trackless tram turned around and turned off. The braid slipped off and ""tilted the braid"". After a while, my uncle snorted again, what level! Driving the trackless tram -randomly driving the trackless tram is about this. After the disappearance of trams in the urban area, the concept of ""rail"" extended. Such as ""derailment"". The word is now widely used, and it is appropriate to describe the extension line of marriage regulations with ""derailment"". In the past, when trams were in all directions, there was such a thing. It was called ""rolling heads"". It was ugly. The word is extremely derogatory, but at the time, there were more tolerance than now. At that time, many people followed the marital values of the age. Even if they were derailed, most of them were derailed after education, and they were derailed very little. Now I rarely hear the saying of ""random tram"". ""Group discussion"" still has it, and there are still no ways to do things. Whenever discussions, those who do not talk nonsense at the venue will hold their mobile phones on the screen. The mobile phone is not a trackless tram, but also a trackless tram. It is a spacecraft. Internationally affairs, rumors of gossip, gossip rumors, gender entertainment ... mobile phones are track -free trams in the Internet era. You do n’t need to drive by yourself. Take a trackless tram to be a crowd of melon. The little girl who opened the 26 -way tram who opened the road in that year, retired decades later, and is still a person who is good at closing the theme. What happened between friends, who would stop it if she was inserted into a department, and she would stop it: Don't drive a trackless tram. But the other party laughed, and she laughed herself -she was a professional -driven tram.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/7.htm,5/3/22,No. 7 Edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space,This hug is a forever,-Recall Teacher Huang Shuqin,"Wang Yueyang Renyin has not yet passed, but he never thought of parting again and again. On the night of April 21, the famous director Huang Shuqin left at the age of 83. The bad news came, endless grief! Missing this beloved artistan, as an outstanding representative of the fourth -generation director, the number of works left by Teacher Shu Qin's life is not the most, and it can affect huge. Many of them are classics in movies and TV history. Essence Teacher Shu Qin is sincere, kind, hard -working, and simple, be improving with art, indifferent to life, enthusiasm for friends, and never forgetting her sincere and bright smile. In terms of fate, both our family and Mr. Huang Zuolin have intersecting in three generations. Mr. Huang Zuolin appreciated my father's stage art. Once watching a comedy show, after the end, the family introduced my father: ""This is the young funny actor Wang Rugang"", Mr. Zuo Lin nodded: ""Well, I know, the most currently Good funny actors. ""My father was very moved by hearing the words. You must know that building Chinese comedy has always been Mr. Huang Zuo Lin's artistic dream. He not only personally directed the filming of the funny movie"" Three Mao Students "", but also led Yao Mu Shuang, Zhou Baichun, Yuan Yiling The Shanghai Funny Drama Troupe was once compiled into the Shanghai People's Art Theater led by him. Yan Shunkai was the comedy he discovered and cultivated. It was undoubtedly a very high honor to be affirmed by Mr. Zuo Lin. Therefore, when Mr. Zuo Lin served as the director of the Shanghai Drama White Magnolia Awards, his father won the protagonist award with the role of the matchmaker ""Yang Yucui"" in the starring ""Ming Media"". As a result, he approached Mr. Zuo Lin, he had to teach, and met with Teacher Shu Qin. After Mr. Zuo Lin's death, his family edited and published the book ""Master of Art Huang Zuolin"", which included a photo of his father and Mr. Zuo Lin. Because of this fate, Teacher Shu Qin and my father also appreciated each other and became friends. Although they did not cooperate with film and television works, they cooperated together with a Kunshi drama ""Pipa"". ""Bags"". Because Mr. Zuo Lin has been adapted from the Kunqu Opera ""Blood Hand"" adapted from the Shake ""Macbeth"", Teacher Liang thought of inviting Teacher Shu Qin to be the director of the show. The freehand, virtual, and programming performance of the Kun opera body is not moved at all, and resolutely centered on actor performance. Second, classical drama must have a classical performance environment, so this drama must be performed on the ancient drama of the ""Sanshan Guild Hall"". Third, the play has a ugly horn. Tea dealer Wu Yilang hopes to invite Wang Rugang to perform. This is also the first time that my father has performed the Kun opera. Later, it turned out that the three requirements of Huang Shuqin all laid the foundation for the success of the Pipa Walk. Especially when the show performed in Germany, the stage imitated the ""Sanshan Guild Hall"" and set up an ancient Chinese aaters, which caused a sensation and praise in the Western art world. In recent years, Director Shu Qin has been old and has almost no longer directed art works, and gradually faded out of everyone's attention. In 2007, Jin Qiu, because Mr. Yang Yan's drama ""Ruyi"" was restored in Shanghai. I deliberately interviewed her and wrote the article ""Two Generations of the Cast City"". Knowing that I was going to interview, she was very happy. She waited early at home and prepared a photo of herself with Qian Yanshu and Yang Yan. The interview of an hour was very happy. Although she was already sick at that time, when she recalled the past, she was still very energetic. The only thing that surprised me was that she often said that she would say something repeatedly and said many times. I remembered that her mother Danny also had a similar situation in his later years, and somehow was sad. And hug me intimately, and touched my head with my hands, completely treating me as a younger child. In the impression, this is also the last time I met her. This hug has also become an unforgettable memory. Later, I also cooperated with her son Zheng Dasheng. It was still the Kunqu -Qixi version of ""Longevity Hall"". My literature was organized, director Zheng Dasheng, starring Zhang Jun and Shen Yanli. Shen Yanli later became a good relationship with Dasheng and became the daughter -in -law of Teacher Shu Qin. It is said that Teacher Shu Qin's physical condition was not good in the last few years. Dasheng was busy with work. Basically, Shen Yili took care of her in detail, bringing warmth and tenderness to her old age ... Unforgettable is so indifferent but sincere, and maintains the deep friendship of the three generations. Now it seems that it is so precious and rare! Now, Mr. Huang Shuqin is gone, recalling the past, and biting his heart, it is particularly sad. My father heard the news and wrote a mourning: ""Returning to the bliss world from the chaotic world, I hope she will go all the way!"" Teacher Shu Qin, never say parting! Unforgettable your sincerity and kindness, and always remember that your director's ""Siege"", ""Human · Ghost · Love"", ""Sin Debt"" ... The years are ruthless, classic immortal!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/8.htm,5/3/22,,

There are 251 re -production and resumption companies in Lingang New Termid area,This semiconductor company has a innovative high shipment in April,Space,"Since April, key enterprises in Lingang New Area have ushered in a ""re -work wave"". The vehicle is running offline one after another; the overall re -work rate of the Shanghai Lingang Industrial Park of Sanyi Heavy Machinery is nearly 20%, and the production volume of domestic orders has been returned to about 30%of the normal period; the Shanghai Electric Port Factory has The personnel of personnel have gradually returned, and the operating rate of national key projects exceeds 50%... As of yesterday, there were 251 re -production and re -production enterprises (including continuous production enterprises) within the Lingang New Area area, all of which were 40,651 in the factory closed production and management personnel. Cumulative acceptance of the city -level white list enterprise applications for the ""re -work certificate"" for returning to the job. At a polished workshop in the factory of Xinli Semiconductor Technology Company Innovation Center, the equipment is fully automatic, which can ensure uninterrupted production for 24 hours. More than 60 employees take the normal operation of the equipment at the scene. Since this round of epidemic, the integrated circuit manufacturing, sealing and testing, and equipment material manufacturers in Shanghai have adopted a variety of closed -loop management measures to ensure the normal production of production. New Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd., located in Lingang New Area, mainly provides key raw materials such as 12 -inch large silicon wafers for downstream chip manufacturing companies. Since the epidemic, production equipment and production lines have been constantly 24 hours. After March 28, nearly 700 employees in key positions such as R & D and production carried out closed -loop operations in the factory area. In order to ensure normal production, the Municipal Economic and Information Commission and other departments have given strong support for the important raws required for production, and various types of ""important materials guarantee permits"" have been handled. In April, the shipments of the 300mm large silicon wafer of the new semiconductor reached the highest point in history, with a cumulative shipment of nearly 5 million pieces. In addition, the memory of the memory continues to maintain the highest historical shipment record. In May, production and sales will reach a new high. ""After 32 days of stopping work, the Management Committee of the Lingang New Area has pulled us back from the dilemma!"" Said Wu Xiaojian, general manager of Shanghai Ai Ai Semiconductor Co., Ltd.. Ai Ai Semiconductor is a company specializing in IC testing. It mainly provides supporting services for the various leading IC design companies in the city. The impact caused by stopping work mainly includes cash flow pressure and loss of loan cooperation. The biggest crisis is customer transfer. In other words, such a transfer is often ""irreversible"". On April 28th, the ""Shanghai Second Batch of Batch in Shanghai"" and the re -work certificate of Lingang New Area were approved at the same time; on the 29th, 21 employees in Ai Ai entered the factory and officially resumed production. On May 1st, the employees of the Ai Ai plant increased to more than 40 employees, and were included in the ""Whitening List"" mechanism of the Lingang New Area area that day. Recently, the Management Committee of Lingang New Trip in the New Trip in Hong Kong has timely adjusted the requirements of resumption of production and resumption of production and prevention and control measures in a timely manner, formulated a ""one enterprise, one plan"", and equipped with ""one enterprise, one commissioner"" or even ""one enterprise and multiple commissioners"" to carry out group services Support enterprises to coordinate and solve problems such as personnel arrival, material transportation, and epidemic prevention and control.

Space,Tiantai View,Space,"When Wang Jiren saw this title, some people thought I was in Tiantai Mountain Scenic Spot in Taizhou, Zhejiang. This is indeed a dream of mine. In this life, he was fortunate to be on this mountain, and even walked dozens of meters like a slow movement on the screen at the Tanggula Mountain Exit. He passed on the top of the mountain through the long ice cave on Tieshan Mountain. But there is a sky outside the sky, there are mountains outside the mountains, and Tiantai Mountain belongs to one of the famous mountains that I have not been to but look forward to the lack of remedy. However, in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Pudong and Puxi have retracted more than 20 days. Shanghai is like a siege, so I can't go out of the world. Instead of becoming a flower in the countryside, it is better to spend difficulties with the local residents of the same city. The rooftop I said here refers to the open -air platform on the top floor of the apartment. I was relocated to this family more than thirty years ago to this tallest building that used to be Xiafei Road. In fact, it was only six floors. The platform was on the seven floors, about one hundred square meters. clothing. On one side is a row of storage rooms, and the other sides are the guardrails of the city wall stacking. The structure of Dingkou is integrated with the facade body structure of the apartment, forming a decorative -style French castle building. In the 30 years of living in this ""castle"", I rarely patronize the rooftop at the top, and I and my family and I have been here three or four times since the city. Although in repeated nucleic acid testing, residents of this building have always maintained a record of negative championships, but they can only walk around the community aisle, lawn and corridor. Because it was boring and boring, our family opened the rooftop trip. The elevator can have been directly reached to the top floor, but I do n’t know why the button is only set to the sixth floor, and then climb a dozen -level stairs to go to the rooftop. On the southeast side of the Tiantai, look all the way along the middle of the Huaihai Sea. There are old houses in Wutong District hovering back and forth near the middle of the Huaihai Sea. Unfortunately, the pigeon whistle sound is not heard. Zhongjing is the Wukang building, but you can only see the above floors. I remember on Christmas Eve last year, a fellow cages of Santa Claus climbed on the balcony, attracting the attention of many passers -by; and in the past, the Shanghai Library was quite huge, but the sculpture of the thinker was covered. The vision is the center of Shanghai, which is straight into the sky, and can be seen from the distance because of the towering towering. The long sound and echo of the whistle on the Huangpu River have not been heard for a long time. In the past, I could pass to dozens of miles away. I have been listening to it as a voice from or going to the distance. Looking at the stacks on the southwest side, the buildings are like undulating mountains. To the Huashan Road of Xujiahui, there is a small arc in the middle, but it does not affect the corner of the Xujiahui business district. If the iron ladder from the platform on the platform is on the top floor, there is the location and computer room of the building's water tank. Thirty years ago, standing on it, the southeast and northwest can be overlooking. Unfortunately, the current vision is blocked by about a half. Huashan Road, Huahai Middle Road and the widening, are the main roads with very busy transportation. After the night, you can also hear the friction of cars on the asphalt road. Essence There is not only the Xujiahui commercial circle nearby, but also the Wukang Building, located in the Wucha intersection, has come and go through the car because of becoming an Internet celebrity landmark building. Conservative estimation. Its wandering function in spirit is far exceeding the shopping consumption function. But holidays are too dense and become a slot. However, when I overlooking and overlooking Huaihai Middle Road and Huashan Road on the platform a few days ago, the Tonglu Avenue, which came and went daily, became empty like a magic, and no one and the car passed. Even the courier brother who was riding a helping car in Changman Street suddenly disappeared. The sense of silence brought by this sudden deserted is amazing. I know that this original international metropolis, which was originally endless, began to be different at the moment of control. I often set up the building to make me think of Wang Yan's ""Denglou Fu"" of the seven sons of Jian'an. In 204 AD, Wang Yijiu thought, boarded the Maicheng Tower of Dangyang, Jingzhou, and looked around, and he wrote the name of this thousand years. This Fu opened Zong Mingyi: ""Dengzilou is looking at four looking at it, and speaking on holidays to sell worries."" It can be seen that the establishment of the building can also be sold, and the sincerity is saying!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/7.htm,5/4/22,No. 7 Edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space,Neighborhood is back again,Space,"Chen Jianxing's epidemic raging in Shanghai, everyone is a house, and a group of mutual assistance has been built in the building. You lack of vegetables, I send it, who has no mask, the neighbors have sent them one after another, and the group dishes are connected together. For more than two decades, the upstairs and downstairs, the left neighbors have never been so harmonious and close, and the neighborhood came back again. Most of the childhood people lived in civilians. Life was not rich, and the living conditions were poor. Lane is like a big family, full of humanity. In summer, some old men and old ladies in the alley often move a small stool to sit in the mouth of Nongtang, but they are not idle in their hands. Once a stranger enters the hall, he will stare at and ask, ""What kind of people are looking for it?"" He had to make a clarifying the door number and name before letting him go in. The family situation of each other in the neighborhood is also fingering. The son of the Zhang family will cut it, and the Li family's daughter -in -law embroidered flowers and embroidered; Uncle Shen's uncle will repair a bicycle, and the daughter of the Wang family is an electrician in the factory ... who has difficulties to come to the door for help, and the neighbors will never shirk. If you meet the old man in the middle of the night, you will go out to help: Some people go to push the yellow croaker, some people move the chair and put it on the car to let the patient lie down. Flying towards the hospital. On the New Year's Eve, the small stove is the busiest place. If you wash the vegetables and cook, I choose the vegetables and let me choose each other. Try to make room for each other. Wang Jiaba rice burned out on the coal ball stove, but Aunt Wang went out to pour the garbage. Aunt Jiang, the neighbor, helped her to open the lid, put it with only chopsticks, and let the rice from pour out the rice. It is also common for the stoves to borrow the green onion and borrow a piece of ginger with a squeeze soy sauce salt oil. Whoever wants to stir -fry the chili caterpillars will say hello in advance, so that people who are afraid of spicy avoided it. Whoever wants to do a happy event, neighbors have a round platform, they will take the initiative to borrow, even tables, stools, pots and pans, and help picking vegetables, wash vegetables, bowls, brushing pots ... children who go to school have lost their children. The key, sitting at the door of the house and waiting for the parents to go home, will be called by the neighbors into the house to eat snacks, do homework, and even eat nighttins. If there are any delicious foods, it will be shared together in the neighborhood. Whoever wraps up, always wants a bowl of a bowl to taste the taste; who has a birthday to give the ribs to the neighbors one by one. The Dragon Boat Festival is wrapped in dumplings, your family gives red bean dumplings, my family gives white rice dumplings, your family gives the rice dumplings, my family gives fresh meat rice dumplings, and shared the varieties and craftsmanship of each family. Before the Spring Festival, the seeds, peanuts, and dried potato brought back by the farm and the children who settled back to the farm and cut back will be sent to each other. Brother is shaving his head in Chongming Farm. Every time he visits relatives and returns to Shanghai, he always does not forget to bring the haircut tools back and take time to shave his head for neighbors. Especially before the Spring Festival, many people in the hall will come to shave their heads and hair cuts. For a while, my house is like a city. Some people also carried hot water bottle and basin, shaved their heads and had to wash their hair for him. The brother also served everyone with no complaints. Neighbors are good relatives who help each other, but sometimes disputes and disputes on some trivial matters. The neighbors did not say hello, and filled the road at the door of the house, and the rain was accumulated at the door of the Sun family. The next day the next day, Sun Jiamu intentionally put the brushed toilet in a place close to the door to show ""protest"". At a glance, the Mom Mom was not happy, and put her toilet next to the Sun's toilet. Originally, both toilets were placed on their door, and now they have reached the boundary line of the two. One day, Sun Jiamu saw that the toilet of the family went to his own place, and he was angry from his heart, and he picked up the toilet to kick the toilet. The Mom Mom, who was buying the fried dough sticks home from the big cake stall, was also angry when he saw this. He picked up the Sun family toilet to the road, and the toilet lid was cracked into two crickets. From then on, the two sizes that looked up and looked down were like strangers. On a sunny day, Sun Jiamu went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables, leaving her son to look at the moldy clothing. Unexpectedly, a rainstorm fell, and the son of the Sun family moved in a hurry to move things. At this time, the first mothers of the family came over to help the Sun family's clothes to dry on the bamboo poles, and then the eldest daughters and younger sons came to help. When Sun Jiamu hurried back, he was stunned by the scene in front of him. The ""enemy"" has become ""loved ones"". The mother of Sun Jiamu murmured, ""Thank you for a family."" In this regard, the two barrels gradually eliminated, and both toilets also withdrew from the position. Although Nongtang has been demolished for many years, I am still thinking about the neighborhood of Nongtang. I hope that the neighborhood after the epidemic will continue and continue ...",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/8.htm,5/4/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup: Nightlight Cup,

Space,Light,Space,"Mei Zihan, I am extraordinarily in love and dependence. During the rainy day, without the sun, I must turn on the lights, and the table lamp on the table must be on. It's not just for reading and writing, even if you are in a circle in the room, sitting there in a daze, you have to light up. With a light light, there was ripples in my heart. Ordinary people are not large and big, joy and depression are only between a pond -like square. There are small fish and shrimp around around, arched with tender memories. In the past, just like small fish and shrimp, it is much more active, and it is up and down. In addition to the day and day, the content of the calendar can also be filled by yourself, adding a bright mood to let yourself fly. After graduating from college, when I left my childhood home, when I went to the university dormitory area to build my own home, my mother asked me what I wanted to take away. I pointed to the long -awaited red cover table lamp and said, ""It."" On the new home's car, I kept holding it from the east to west of the city. It was later on my desk, night and gloomy during the day. When I was a kid, I did homework under its light, and later it was screened by writing literature, preparing for lectures for lessons. For a long time, the lampshade was old, Joe Qi was crispy and looked down. I looked around for changing, and I couldn't find it. It is a classic Chinese design, and it is stuck out of the mouth of the high -end Yangmuurong body, and the exquisite landing hangs. Even a few places have to be reflected by the crispy loopholes. But I still have to be bright. It is bright, and many of them are on. Fortunately, one of my loving uncle helped find the master, and almost made a brand new one exactly the same. This uncle was me who had been in the infant. He often came home as a guest. He was familiar with the red one on the table. It must have inevitability, and my earliest memory is also related to lighting. It was a time when it was very small. The enemy aircraft flying from the island bombed the power plant. They have come to explode, fix, and come again. They don't want the people here to have lights, hoping to be dark. It was the night, and my grandmother hugged me and said to me, Mao Mao, don't be afraid. The sky outside the window has a staggered visit. The long lamp column cuts through the sky, shaking, a small child can also feel that it is so powerful and safe. A young child may have deep memories of black and bright. The shocking in the night, the calmness and power of the dark light of the darkness, it is impossible to describe it when he was young, but it would become a memory. Such memories may not be charming, but it has it, but it is also charming. It is rich in my pond and swimming. Later, those planes were chased away by the lighting lights, and later, I probably fell asleep. Detective lights defend our life, my right to grow up. At that time, the home was very close to the power generation plant, and it was very close to the gas factory and the water plant. These are all those planes who want to explode, very vicious! Light and lights are in me, and there is an automatic induction, and it will be bright. If the shadow follows, it will also sprinkle my literary text. The boy in the masterpiece of French literature ""Little Prince"" traveled to several other little asteroids after leaving his asteroid. He felt puzzled, incredible, and even disgusted. The only thing I think can be appreciated, and even the planet who wants to stay there. Although the lighting people do not have their own ""thoughts"" and behavioral mechanical, after all, his lighting profession is bright, as if raising the stars and illuminating the world beautifully. Although his planet is small, it is also the world. This person who lights up is the most certain meaningful person encountered by the little prince in the asteroid travel. He has the logic of life, and the little prince wants to be friends with him. Everyone has their own small ponds and asteroids, staying in their own small square, and contact the world again. People who are counted as writers, others think you are very level. In fact, you have written some stories, telling some experiences, and talking about mood. Whether it is completely true or purely fiction, it will pass to the eyes and ears of others and ears. Scenery and sound. It's a bit bright, darker, and it will make different ripples of others. I only chose to talk about a little bright person and things. It is my philosophy and aesthetics, so it is obviously a very difficult years. There are heavy and scars. I try to pass by as much as possible between the text. There are clear weather, secret joy, and kindness in any year and month. I don't like to stand under the dark clouds, anger and the road I have passed by, and the footprints that have been stepped out, and others have read the staple. What I decided is: it is true, but it is warmer, beautiful, and more poetic ... It ’s hard to have a big truth, but there is a small light! Light can also be written. Like the melody, painting in the color. I used to go to the small town in Paris, stepped into the small building where Van Gogh lived, the secret stairs, the small room, a small sunroof, the poor days, the money to buy bread was not enough, there was not much bright. But he was fascinated and painted in McDonald, and he was overwhelming! Is that the impression that he saw his eyes golden, or did he have a golden growth in his heart? Looking for a bright angle, writing and drawing the life and world of light and shadow are another great significance of literature and art. It encourages life and years to make the mood bright. In the years when the farm was educated, the days were a little dazzling. There is a small bungalow dormitory and lived in six or seven people. A dull bulb was hung in the middle of the roof, sprinkled into each person through the tent, and the rest was faint. A few people brought a small table lamp to steal the wires and light up on the bedside. It violated the regulations, but the leaders did not confiscate forcibly, and their eyes closed with their eyes closed. The word in the song that was very mighty but sang again: ""365 miles, 365 days of spending every day, one day, one journey,"" I don’t know what to do Time is head. The young people want to be careful to be accommodated with a little light on the bedside. It's just a little good, how many nights are bright and warm. The person with litting the bed is light, and the people with open eyes and closed eyes also have light in their hearts. Goodwill is light. It is bright and bright, and they are all bright people. Anyone who is in love is more than any one! They wrote to their parents under the light, read the book newspaper, and won't work hard during the day to work hard ... I am not brave and dare not take it, but I always look at it when I walk through. At a glance, his heart was slightly beating. Now I think of that slightly beating, still beautiful and sad. Because I read and write a small pair in the tallest light every night in the faint light in my account, I unintentionally prepared the future. The faint light is also light. So I also prepared to write tonight. The light is written under the light of the old desk lamp.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/7.htm,5/5/22,,
Space,Greetings Da Chang Teacher,Space,"Wang Zhengyu picked a beam of sunlight, and it would look brighter in the bright room. It was placed in a melancholy corner, always with melancholy. During the anti -epidemic, the openness or gloom of everyone at home must be related to whether it is sunny in their hearts. The famous actor Da Shi Chang, must be full of sunshine in his heart. After retiring, the actor troupe needs the help of the predecessors in the entertainment industry. He and his old partners go without any conditions. Now that the epidemic prevention and control, he cannot go out. He still cares about social news, cares about colleagues in the troupe, and sometimes looks out of the window, picking up the camera to shoot the hard -working scene of the ""big white"". Yes, at the eighth year of the year, he could not direct as much as Tian Wenzhong in ""Unforgettable Battle"", but still concerned and firmly believed in the final victory. Da Shi is often older than me, but we are the contemporary people. When he graduated from college, the ""Young Generation"" starred in him stirred up my boiling blood, and Xiao Jiye and Lin Yusheng in the film gave me great inspiration. After that, I also paid much attention to his works. The deep, stable, accurate and delicate performance and elegant style are worth learning and admiration. What I am happy is that later, I have cooperated with him in two TV series. In art, he learned a lot from him. He was my teacher. The TV series ""Shanghai Family"" is a huge book that reflects the beginning of Shanghai's reform and opening up and the reform of the system. Liu Qiong, Ling Zhihao, Zhongxinghuo and other film and television giants are starred. I am among them, the deputy factory director Cao Jun. I rarely play villains. In the first scene, Cao Jun went to Jiaojia to send turtles, fart, and explore the news for the official hat. Director Yao Shoukang stopped me when the audition: ""Do you want to perform bad guys?"" I nodded. He shook his head: ""Really bad guy, the surface never looks like a bad guy. The plot development, the contradictions will show that he is so bad in the conflict."" He also said: ""You will experience it after you play the opponent's drama."" The scene, I went to Jiaohongji's office, saying that it was also to be pleased to transfer his little sister -in -law to work in the factory. In the play, Jiao Hongji did not understand Cao Jun, so Da Shi often spoke peacefully, and Chun Chun asked. The opponent's drama often inspires each other and creates the atmosphere of the plot. I was infected by him, and performed a chic, understanding, reasonable, and covering my heart. Undoubtedly, the film is the artistic art, but it is inseparable from the creation of actors. During the filming of ""Ziye"", Director Fu Jinggong asked me to watch on the spot. A actor asked Sang Ancan: ""How about my shot performance?"" Director Sang replied: ""I am a director, I can't act!"" Its wonderful words. The film ""Tan Yitong"", due to the failure of the change, Tan Yitong was killed. Before the sister -in -law's sword cut off, Da Shi often designed a shot in this play: a small worm flew on the cutter platform. Tan Yitong smiled and waved gently to let the worm fly away. This detail, the inner world of Tan Yong and the inner world of being fearless, and being kind and straightforward, showed vividly. This creation is very inspiring to me. The plot of ""Shanghai Family"" developed later, and the Metallurgical Bureau was formed. Although Cao Jun entered the leadership team, it still made trouble. Jiao Hongji made a decision to severely expose Cao's true appearance and revoke all his positions. At this moment, Cao Jun was at a loss and panic. How to perform? According to the rhythm of the play, it is impossible to give many shots. I designed a smoking movement, the sponge head cigarette poured, a little cigarette, coughing, and the sponge head was watching the fire ... A medieval scene revealed the character's heart. There was also a play. Cao Jun and the former director of the Oriental Factory Gong (played by He Lin) were embarrassed to be treacherous, and the director Gong was arrested for corruption. When the scene of catching Gong was filmed, I asked the director to give Cao a shot. Under the building was Gong Dai handcuffed into the police car, and then picked up a shot to push the close -up. Cao Jun looked at the window upstairs. There is no need to do any expression. In a combination of Monteci, the audience immediately understood what kind of person Cao was. After this episode was broadcast, my neighbors met me, and they all scolded: ""I can't think of the individual played by Nong, it is bad!"" And Da Shi often cooperated for the second time. Hong Kong merchants. He played the Captain of the Public Security Bureau, and finally detected the case and seized the interrogation of Hong Kong business. The interrogation drama is really in the interrogation room in a detention center in Shanghai, and I really wear handcuffs. Before the filming, he laughed: ""You are a bad guy again, we are an old opponent!"" I said, ""This time is an acting criminal."" I felt deeply, and I learned a lot. Later, when directed the TV series ""The Lanhua of Late"", Zhu Manfang came to praise me. I replied: ""Thank you elder sister."" I said in my heart, I learned from my predecessors giants and you, learned or stole study! Da -style work is superb, and he is enthusiastic. In the past few years, the film reform was rough for the first time. Many people were not satisfied and dared not to observe. He dared to stand up for everyone, and finally changed the plan. Everyone remembers this, and my friends who have told me. Last year, he played Zhang Lan in the TV series ""Glory and Dreams"". Zhang Lan Zengyun: ""People must not be self -love, they must not be self -study, they must not be self -esteem, they must not be self -reliant, but they can't deceive themselves."" Sincerity, Say! Now we face unprecedented hardships, but always full of beliefs. History will remember today, the best thing is the time you spent. How many years have passed, the years have passed, and the old one is memories.

Space,She has always existed deeply,—— Remembering Teacher Wang Yumei,"During my elementary school, Xi Meijuan once watched a widely disseminated film comic ""After the Harvest"". I knew a actor named Wang Yumei. Before the ""After the Harvest"" was made into a movie, a stage play was performed by the Shandong Provincial Talking Troupe in the 1960s. In the stage drama and story film of the same name, Teacher Wang Yumei played the main character Zhao Wuxi in the play, with excellent reputation. In the 1980s, I was already a young actor in Shanghai Renyi. At that time, the film factory produced a sensational movie ""Flower Rings under the Mountains"". Teacher Wang Yumei played the mother of a hero warrior in the film, leaving a deep impression on people. At that time, I read a report of a movie symposium. In the article, Director Xie Jin specifically praised Teacher Wang Yumei's performance status. He introduced that Wang Yumei talked to him before shooting. When talking about the role of ""mother"", she said When she heard the news of her son's sacrifice at the front line, she immediately felt that the whole portrait was ""short"". Teacher Wang Yumei is very unique. It is soaked in the actor's deep experience and perception of the role. It is completely unique to use his own heart to tightly stick to a flesh and blood body. This sentence left me a deep impression: the real real performance artist was used to make a character born with such an attitude. In my young heart, I felt a word with myself, and I knew what was called ""whole body and mind"". I really interact with Wang Yumei in the 1990s. We participated in the TV series ""Children's Love"" together, playing a pair of mothers and daughters in the play. ""Children's Love"" is a realistic urban family drama. It depicts the oscillation of the urban renovation project in the process of reform and opening up involving the vital interests of ordinary people, as well as the work of housing relocation to each ordinary family. The mother of the Shanghai Shikumen Hall of Shikumen, played by Teacher Wang Yumei, has six children. The wife was lying on the bed shortly after the plot. As we all know, the citizen culture of Shikumen has a distinctive characteristics of Shanghai. The main actor of the crew of ""Children's Love"", except Mr. Wang Yumei, is almost all Shanghai actors, and the role of mother is the soul figure in the play. In the ""like"" sensitive topic of Shanghai mother, I do not know that year Does Teacher Wang Yumei feel pressure? But from the perspective of a peer, I think there must be stress. But everything has its laws and individual interpretations. Speaking of which, I think of what the famous screenwriter Liu Heng said: ""Everyone who is dedicated, there is one, who is a master who is accustomed to putting pressure on himself ..."" Teacher Wang is undoubtedly a dedicated actor, When she came to the crew of Shanghai from the Shandong Theater, she immediately merged with the members of the crew. In her life, she was close to us with six actors who played her children. I remember that the main scene of that year was built in a studio of the Shangying Factory. After starting to enter the shooting, Teacher Yumei made an extraordinary shot. Family labor. For my wife lying on the bed, it is more meticulous. I remember that she also specially made a thick and long rope with a broken cloth strip, which was used as the props in the play, tied to the bedside of the wife, and tied to her waist. Anyone, when my wife told her to hear, she could call her with a pull rope. This special and ""one"" character characteristic prop design has remembered it so far. I think this is a typical artistic model worthy of attention. Because the image of Shanghai women, especially elderly women in film and television works, often exaggerate some of the characteristics of some places. The performance of Teacher Wang Yumei did not have this consideration at all. I think there is only one standard for Teacher Wang to create artistic characters, that is, professional standards. She never allows herself to interpret it. Exaggeratedly showing one or two dialects, or conceptual expression of some secular habits, thinking that doing so can solve the problem of the so -called ""like"" Shanghai people; she presented a wisdom and kindness for the audience from a higher level. , The image of the simple oriental mother. The Shanghai mother interpreted by Teacher Wang Yumei let the audience who had watched the TV series ""Children's Love"" had a stomachache, and praised the public, but completely ignored that she was an actor from the north. I often think, as a professionals, what do we have to learn from seniors artists? There is something worthy of our younger generations to learn. Obviously, I saw the professional spirit of a professional actor in Teacher Wang Yumei. The professional spirit I said is actually a professionalism. Every time she meets me and chats, no matter the time or short time, I can feel this literacy lightly. One is the consciousness of learning. When she realized that the times were developing rapidly, she wanted to know everything and wanted to learn everything. We usually live in a city, and of course there are not many opportunities to meet with Teacher Wang, but every time I see Teacher Wang Yumei, I do n’t hear that she is broken and wounded. He is a performing artist who consciously integrated into the torrent of life. The second is her obsession and modest attitude towards performance. Teacher Wang told me many times that we are the same workers as practitioners of other occupations, but we are different in occupations. Our difference is that we are engaged in art labor. Look at the broad and deep real world in front of you. At this point, I also take it seriously. I think that in ordinary life, you can only see the essence through the phenomenon with the vision of the vision. For art workers, it is extremely important to treat life with a horrible perspective instead of a high perspective. This world has been flowing since ancient times, and we don't know how many people have passed by in our life. However, what should be kept in her heart has always existed deeply: it can't be kept, it is just a cloud of smoke, don't care. Teacher Wang Yumei has been engaged in the career of her life and is an artist in performing arts, but she will have the artistic image left by the audience with her heart, and she will definitely be in the hearts of the audience for a long time!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/7.htm,5/6/22,The 7th edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space,About borrowing money,Space,"Generally speaking, the person who presss you step by step is yourself. When you take care of your decentness and tell those who may help you, although you are ready to be rejected, it is still optimistic. Often, once borrowing is proposed to private persons, there will be a short still field, and then the sharp atmosphere will come abruptly. Things used to cover up on weekdays will fall off, leaving only the meaning of mystery. Just like the handle of the copper pot, except the layer of cloth wrapped in, it is no longer like that; again, hold it, scream to scream. Those who reject you have been arranged one after another. Generally speaking, the person who really helps you will also appear in an unexpected way if you exist. It should not be like this in imagination, but this is normal. The reason is simple. When you apply for borrowing money from your individual, you are mostly not concerned about it. Others pay attention to property security, far from what you expected to think so lightly. You are shocked, people are so afraid of losing you, but just afraid of losing money. You find that you are already a problem with a problem, approaching you, just like the sword of the Damoris who is close to it, which is uncomfortable. As for your nobleness and decentness, only one round is ignored. Some people have speculated that your request seems to have 1%of bad suspicion. In order to protect his IQ and property, he would rather not have concern for the fact that 99%of the facts that you need to help you need to support it, so he will reject it. Some people think that your state is inferior and defiled the reputation of his social level. You have lost your mutual benefit and deleted you in the address book. There will be no negative ripples in interests. Some people are worried that you lack the ability to repay, and claim debt is more headache than borrowing debts. Why your trouble, if you want to transform into others' uneasiness, you will reject it. Some people know that they are not able to help each other now, but they are not willing to make you know so clearly, so they will reject it. Some people think that you are a little deeper, and such dilemma should not appear. Some people think that if you don't work hard enough, how can you easily share the harvest of others with hard -sweat? Those who think about the problem in the past may also help others, but the time has moved. Someone is secretly embarrassed. If you reject you for a real reason A, which hinders him to look at him further, find a reason for B to refuse you back and coax himself. Of course, because of various considerations, even if you respond to you, you are omitted, and there are not a few. Since it is a request, all the rejection should be accepted rationally. If you are not hateful in the past, I hope you still. The fact is that compared with the friendship between you, the money of others is on the side of the balance, you are like a balloon floating, and it is embarrassed. You can't do it, you are upset, shame, and panic. This is a punishment for a mistake, defeat, and loser. Around us, why many people are not willing to be considerate, and even help those who need money, including those who have experienced money from others, and later do not necessarily want to look at the current borrowers. People always think that borrowing money people, either they are spending, or where they have faults, and they are unhappy to embarrass others. They should be cold. It is certain where the borrowing people have a problem, but they may not be a good person. Many people think of, why do you want to fall voluntarily to this point? Shouldn't you let you get a strict lesson in the group? Due to lack of money, the continuous steps when you retreat, and the more ugly cases of the world are everywhere. The world is everywhere. Many lack of money are pursued by the urgent situation, and their hearts are horizontal, and they go in the direction of Lai and deception. No wonder people's disgusted borrowing money, the probability of subsequent unpleasant unpleasantness is too large, simply avoided, almost fixed. There is an old saying in the Shanghai dialect that it should be a proverbs refined from the market. It is called: when encountering things, do not mess with your feet. Most people will experience the crisis of hitting difficulty. If the people are adversed, whether the pace can be unable to keep the pace, and go to the wild here. Some people have fallen, and some people have a deep look at their precious opportunities, and it is unknown to take off. Some people say that in foreign countries, everyone rarely borrow money from each other, which mainly refers to the middle class. Besides, developed countries use social methods to solve reasonable overdrafts and borrowing needs, such as the shortage of funds such as studying and seeking medical treatment. These are generally implemented in developing countries and also need long or short hours. I have been a blue -collar worker in Sydney for many years. He has a colleague Jackson. He is an assembly line worker and the chairman of the factory union. Chairman Jackson borrows 20 Australian dollars from my friend almost every Monday, and pays the salary every Thursday afternoon. I think this kind of borrowing is not too big. The reputation of Chairman Jackson made him use the opportunity to use resources. Friends also said that there was a shareholder in his factory, a Jews who came to Sydney from Hungary in the early years. Jewish shareholders once told my friends that he had three daughters, and the younger daughter bought a house to borrow money from herself, and the shareholders funded her. He said that this part of this part will be deducted in my inheritance allocation. His grasp of fairness and clearness; at the same time, let the child's living conditions improve in advance. I even think that rich people lend money to those who need urgent need, which is not bad. The hoarding wealth resources have become alive and flowing into urgent need. Some trivial people's livelihood problems also solve the channels. It is just that the reputation and contract spirit of people will be tested more. On the one hand, as soon as there is a loan that occurs, it is not good enough to pay back; on the other hand, people who need money are not considerate and respectful. There is no need to see borrowing money so scary and not dignified. What really should pay attention to is the adherence to the spirit of contracts, fairness, reputation and mutual assistance. Financial integration is not an outdated sign. Borrowing money from private personnel is not popular in foreign society, which is related to the relatively complete and mature foreign social service system, and incompleteness is related to the spiritual heritage of people. In recent years, with the increase in the gap between the rich and the poor in our society, the rich selection of material enjoyment, the increase in profit and loss of financial activities, the urgent needs that are unpredictable, and the unpredictable need is frequent. The demand for lending from privately has increased significantly. A phenomenon that is not difficult to find is that people are not compassionate to the use of models, and are accustomed to only paying attention to or blaming their failure, advanced or incompetent. In the era of heroes, there will be a large frustrated base group, which will be the handsome of the morning star. The concerns of temporarily inconsistent people such as business activities and encouragement to their second charge should be counted as a kind of warmth. Organic people may say that being a kind of good person who borrows money to people will start with you. Frankly speaking, I have done two roles in borrowing and lending, and it is not a big deal. Respect those who wish to be good, and get better.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/8.htm,5/6/22,8th edition: Nightlight Cup,

COVID-19 Epidemium Prevention and Control Press Conference,"Shanghai College Entrance Examination Examination College Entrance Examination July 7th to 9th, July 11th to 12th",Kindergarten enrollment and compulsory education enrollment rules released in late month,"At 10 am this morning, the 176th COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference was held in Shanghai. Deputy Mayor Chen Qun introduced that this year, more than 50,000 candidates in the city will participate in the autumn college entrance examination, and 110,000 candidates will take the entrance examination. For candidates and parents this year's college entrance examination and middle school entrance examination arrangements, on the basis of listening to the opinions of relevant departments, relevant experts, principals of middle schools, teachers and students of the third grade of high school, and students from the third grade, and the parents of the students, according to the opinions of all parties, according to the current epidemic defense The situation of control, after careful research and reporting to the Ministry of Education's consent, made the following adjustments: The city's autumn college entrance examination examination will be extended from July 7th to 9th, and the level of high school academic level examination is postponed to June 18-19; the entrance examination The extension of the post-July 11th-12th, the cancellation of the junior high school experimental examination, the foreign language listening and speaking test, the relevant examination results are scored in the middle school entrance examination with the full score. Because the epidemic has made the above adjustment, it is mainly based on three aspects of consideration: First, before the big test, it is necessary to leave the necessary time for the senior high school students to go to the school to study as possible. After the epidemic, the students walked directly into the examination room from the house, and the state of the exam may be difficult to guarantee. Principal and teachers generally believe that on the premise of meeting the premise of preventing and controlling the epidemic, it is necessary to leave a period of time for candidates to study at school, consolidate the results of the review, stabilize the mentality before the test, and adapt to the examination environment, so as to be better in a better state. Welcome to the exam. The second is to leave a certain time interval between the level test and the autumn unified examination. The autumn unified examination comparison level test rights are important, and a certain time interval is left between the two exams, so that the candidates will concentrate on reviewing for a period of time after completing the level test to meet the tests of the three subjects of the language, numbers, and foreign countries. More reasonable and in line with past practice. The third is to make the examination arrangements more operable. The physical and chemical experiments of the middle school entrance examination and foreign language hearing and speaking tests have high requirements for epidemic prevention in the examination room, and the organization is more difficult. It accounts for a low weight in the total scores, especially because of the epidemic cause. The third grade students are actually unable to receive rationalized experimental training. After comprehensive consideration, these two tests were decided to cancel these two tests this year, and the relevant scores were included in the total score of the middle school entrance examination. Wang Ping, director of the Municipal Education Commission, said that the Municipal Education Commission will earnestly achieve ""fairness, security, orderly, and warmth in various links of propositions, scrolls, group examinations, evaluations, enrollment, and admission. In response to special circumstances such as centralized isolation treatment or nucleic acid abnormalities that candidates may occur at that time, emergency test sites, centralized isolation test sites will be set up, different types of special test rooms will be set up, and closed -loop transfer teams will be established in advance to ensure that ""the test should be taken."" Next, we will mobilize the power inside and outside the education system to do a good job of concern and help with candidates, especially for candidates who are infected with COVID-19 and the experience of close isolation. ""One person and one policy"" do a good job of work carefully; optimize and improve the emergency plan, and create the conditions for ""testing should be exams"". Based on the establishment of conventional test sites and test rooms, emergency test sites and test rooms are set up according to the need for epidemic prevention. In response to the entrance and enrollment enrollment of kindergartens that everyone cares about, compared with last year, the policy is stable this year, and the rules will be released in the end of the month.

Space,"Railway Signal Works Change to the Community ""Air Courier""",Space,"A small drone with the door number of the building, slowly landing at the door of the community. After the takeoff checked the address, put a box of antihypertensive drugs on the drone airdrop. After a distance of 200 meters, the drone successfully landed. After getting the medicine in the 70s, the neighbor Grandma could use ""surprise"" to describe her mood- ""Hi"" finally got the medicine. For the first time in my life, I witnessed the delivery of drones. This scene occurred in the Baoshan North Bank County Court of Baoshan District, Shanghai, which was closed, and staged more than once. Young people who operate drones, named Yu Dongping, are a signal worker in the EMU carrier workshop of Shanghai Electricity Section of China Railway Shanghai Bureau Group Co., Ltd. The idea of practical drones to transport materials originated from accident. Yu Dongping's community began to be closed on April 1, and it still belongs to the control zone. One day, he received a call from the courier brother early in the morning, saying that the egg he bought had been placed on the shelves in front of the community. Who knew that when it was dark, the panting volunteer sent the supplies to his house. ""When I talked to the volunteers who sent the supplies, I could feel that they were too hard to see him wearing heavy protective clothes."" There was a positive case of the building where Yu Dongping was located, watching the whole body ""armed"", goggles, goggles. It is all volunteers with sweat and fog. He thinks, can he do something, which can reduce the risk of cross -infection, reduce the labor intensity of volunteers, and improve the distribution efficiency? He set his sights on his drone. It was a portable drone that he purchased last year for aerial photography. The weight can be about 3 kilograms. In addition, his community is a ""non -prohibited area"", and an idea of using drones on behalf of ""running legs"" was formed immediately. After a few days, Yu Dongping bought the toothpaste and arrived, so he began to try to pick up the goods with drones. The drone flew to the gate of the community smoothly. After communicating with the courier brother, the toothpaste was fixed on the airdrop, and he manipulated the drone to start the ""return mission"". Soon, ""Shoufei"" was successful! Later, there were more and more things he had transported with drones, vegetables, medicines, toilet paper ... Yu Dongping said: ""Every flight returns, as long as the aircraft and supplies are disinfected, it will really be in contact with After ""flying experience"", he made this drone ""running a little brother"" and served the neighbors around him for free. He and his drone became the ""celebrity"" in the community. Who has emergency supplies such as medicines to be delivered and the weight is within the atmosphere of the drone, and it will tell Yu Dongping in the WeChat group that after he ""receives the order"" online Essence Gradually, the ""drone delivery"" incident has become the ""new top flow"" in the community with more than 3,000 residents. There is a constant stream of people looking for him. The machine is ""resting"". Yu Dongping used to be a naval warrior. After entering the railway department, he has completed the security mission at Shanghai South Railway Station many times. His WeChat personality signature is ""My heart is always hot"". In the war epidemic, he also used a hot heart to help others: ""Facing the epidemic, you must bite your teeth, unite, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight Victory. In a special period, as long as it is convenient for everyone and help everyone, I am willing to try it. ""This reporter Jin Zhigang",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/5.htm,5/7/22,,

Space,The title of Merrill Calligraphy and Calligraphy,Space,"Feng Jicai's pen and ink gift is a relationship between literati. There is no entertainment here, and there is no reluctance. Once, Meilin gave me two small paintings, one cow and a horse, all used with a thick Mark pen to draw on a kind of like -like rice paper. The paper is quite strange. It is a kind of antique paper. The color is like the red -yellow old silk or old paper commonly common in the Tang and Song paintings, which are covered with mottled old marks. Meilin's painting ""Mark Painting"" is very simple, with a penny to the extreme. He is old, and his vitality is all over. This horse and this cow painting is good. It is a boutique. I laughed: ""Some postscripts and stamps are painted by the Tang or Song people."" He said, ""Let's go to the topic again."" I then wrote. The title in ""Horse"" said: ""Why are the animals who are the Korean family? Han Qian painted horses, Han Yan painted cows, and the cow and horse Han Meilin also. Could it be that the previous life is a cattle and a horse? You ask me, I don’t know, I don’t know , Still ask Merrill Lynch. Ding Yingqiu Zhi. Talent.

""Meilin's paintings are too individual, the cow is strong, and the bullishness is strong. Alas, horses are unrestrained, Han Meilin is unrestrained and strong, so his favorite painting is also.

He said that the scroll was invited to the post, two volumes of the same content, and then he volume, I volume. I took it back to the studio and opened it on the painting case. A strong style came.

Space,Master,Space,"In the summer vacation of Jiang Zi, I was boring at home in the middle school entrance examination, and was not sure about the high school in high school. As a rural teenager in the Ganzhong area, the so -called road other than reading is nothing more than learning a craft and a craftsman. There are a lot of craftsmanship in the central Ganzhong area, and the more common are the muders, carpenters, craftsmen, shaved artists, and pigsters. The muddy craftsman must endure the wind and the sun, the carpenters want to make it strong, shave their heads and always stand, and kill pigs. It is not too laborious to be a craftsman, the wind can't be dripped, and it is not worried about eating and drinking. Moreover, I have a uncle who brought back a beautiful, exotic dialect, and the whole village was sensational. When I met a master of a craftsman, I was worried that I couldn't find an apprentice, so I recommended it to him. He hesitated for a while and finally brought me. The reason why the master hesitated was because he had a different relationship with me. Just say, he is my father. My father's craftsman did well. The mats he made will not be bad for seven or eight years. The bamboo bed he made, and other master of craftsmen may have been scattered early, and his iron hoop is still as strong. His dustpan, basket, and sunburn are durable and beautiful. With this craft, his father became a well -known master of craftsmanship, and he had many apprentices. Many apprentices followed him after they came to the teacher, leaning on his victim (that is, customer) resource life. It was a night of moonlight. We and his party with five people -my father and my father, Confucius and Liu Zhuzai, who became the master of the master, and one of the apprentices of the pig -from his hometown. Departing, a tractor was stopped on the barge of Ganjiang River in Xishabu Wharf, Sanli Road. Listening to the sound of the car, watching the shadow under the moonlight is like a beast, and we rushed east of the Jiangjiang River with the destination of our trip and the field resources. From our village west of Gan to our destination, the Shuangcun east of the Ganjiang River is more than thirty miles. We got the car in a town, and then walked for about half an hour. Our arrival caused a commotion in the villagers, and we could see that their father was very popular here. My father talked with people, saying that pesticides and fertilizers, talking about crop farming, or speaking a few local dialects between them, it was completely a clear and enthusiastic, enthusiastic and alive, and it was not the same as the clumsy tongue in my hometown. Essence Someone saw strange me and asked my father if she was a new apprentice. My father nodded, which was default. Other people of us were unwilling, and we did not tell my real relationship with my father. We started to work early the next morning. I started the life of a real apprentice. Our lives are all communicated with people from the door, and then it is easy to arrange time and personnel based on how difficult it is to live. His father and his two apprentices have a division of labor according to the skills of craftsmanship. For example, if Confucius weaving pads or mats are good, he is often arranged for weaving pads and mats. Liu Zhuzai is a bit higher to make a basket dustpan level, and he is mainly responsible for the work of the basket dustpan. The father always or picks the most difficult job, such as making bamboo beds and bamboo chairs. The raw materials of the bambooware are bamboo. After the bamboo is opened, bamboo slices are formed. Bamboo slices are divided into two layers of blue and yellow. Masters must decompose the blue and yellow layers into a picnic of weaving bambooware as needed. Ten meters long bamboo must be decomposed into a number of crickets with ten meters long. To make these slices smooth, in addition to the knife in the master's hands and the bars with a pupae (equivalent to the planer that makes the wood smoother in the hand of the carpenter), the apprentices also want to pull back and forth. The most common scene of this industry is the master sitting and scraping, and a little apprentice in the back ran back and forth with a ten -meter -tadpole. Every day I go to a new master's house, waiting for the master to break the bamboo, and then run back and forth. After one or two hours, I am often tired of sweating. After pulling up, the masters were busy weaving, and I would squat or sit, facing the broken pads, mats, and baskets, and used new slices to repair the flaws above. To be honest, I feel novel in the beginning. I think I may do this in my lifetime. I can't help but feel a ritual in my opponent's work. Every day I pull it seriously, repair, and entangle the masters to teach me to talk to the rivers and lakes. It is both mysterious and interesting if some owners who do not want to listen to the owner at the scene. In order to make myself quickly look like an apprentice, I learned the tone of the masters in a rough tone, and also learned to drink. I looked at the masters and shook my head straight. Chinese food and dinner, I drink a little rice wine prepared by the masters. I will be a little dizzy at the beginning of drinking, but after a few days, I get used to it. But it didn't take long for this day, and I started to be deeply tired. ——I am the news of my father's son. I do n’t know how to be known by the locals. His father was healed by the locals. Yes, in people's concepts, my father is a stingy, and his son is also a rampant. How much is this family? I think my father must be very angry. Because when I watched his craftsmanship smoking, his brows frowned even worse than before, and it was even more ignorant about me. And I still hang it. Why should I look at his face. But his father finally couldn't help it. At that time, all five of us worked in the family. After I pulled up, I went to repair a basket that broke the corner. That is actually a difficult work. The pyramids used for repair come out of this surface from the corner of the basket. You must find the corresponding path on another side. The puppets in my hand repeatedly stunned, and then I thought I inserted into a wrong track. When a piece of puppet was wrong, it was wrong. In the end, the corner of this basket was made up by the vulnerability. My father found my mistake from a distance (I suspect that he has been watching me secretly), and began to scold. Finally, the anger was getting bigger and bigger. I have endured it for a long time. I threw the basket aside and said that I would not do it. My father is even more angry. The range of movements in his hand was getting bigger and bigger, and he scolded in his mouth: ""You will roll now!"" I walked out of the tool without talking about it. My tears flowed down. In order to prevent others from seeing my tears, I started running. Then I heard the shouting. ""Come back. Don't run! We will return in two days!"" It was my master and my father. His voice was far from the jumping like a thunder, but as if he was asking for mercy. I finally returned to the class and became a re -study student in the third grade. I was only fifteen years old, but after that period of life, I changed my past to the stubbornness and became old -fashioned and unsmiling. One year later, my efforts had a return. I was admitted to the teacher, and became a person who had a national rice bowl and let my father's face in front of the sidelines east of his Ganjiang River. During that time, it has already become a thing of the past. Now I am already a person who is in the age of heaven. My father is also an old man in the old age. But that experience is still embedded in our lives. Over the years, every New Year's Eve dinner, there is a ritual on my dining table: I poured a glass of wine, shouting ""Master"" to my father, and then drank. The father always lifted his cup with a face, and pursed two sips, as if when he was doing a lot, he was calm when he was sitting in his chief expression, and everyone consciously bowed to him.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/8.htm,5/7/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup,

There are green fat red and thin scenes everywhere, but during the May Day holiday, I was still in the rental house, and I couldn't go anywhere. Listening to Lin Ying crying silently, my thoughts floated into the distance. I want to go to the peony garden to see the flowers, I want to lie on the grass slopes in the countryside, want to pick the tender and seductive strawberries, and want to doze off the warm sun ... Just when I thought so, my mother called. ""Girl, what are you doing?"" Hearing, his mother was bored. I rolled my hair and said it was dazed. My mother smiled, saying that I was a dumb girl, and then laughed again, the grandfather was dull. It turned out that his father woke up in the morning and was okay. After looking at the cats downstairs all the time, he couldn't help but guess the cat's mind. He and his mother said that cats must want to grab the fish in the pond, otherwise why do they go on the water, don't be afraid to fall? It is also said that maybe cats are not to eat fish, they are boring, they want to tease the fish, and from time to time, put their paws into the water, scared the fish and dare not surface ... The mother said too much to her father these days, Chen Sesame was finished, and he couldn't find any new topics, so he called me. I understand my mother's intention. She needs someone to speak to her, and she wants to hear some new things. So, I was happy to tell her about the supplies issued by the nearest neighborhood committee. There is a whole chicken, and there is a box of milk, lettuce, eggplant, cucumber, green pepper, and there are many categories! When it comes to these foods, the mother is here with interest. She asked, how do you plan to burn that chicken? Do you know which one these dishes are eaten first? Do you want to cook according to the time you stored the dishes, do you understand? Mother, she surrounded the stoves all her life, shuttled in the field, and she was too familiar to cooking about cooking, and she was also endless. I am happy with her so energetic. Because the epidemic was stranded in Shanghai, she suffered a lot of suffering. If she could talk like this, she would feel much more comfortable. ——It a few months ago, I lay in bed and read a book at night, and suddenly received a video call from my mother. She was very excited on the other side of the phone. She held her mobile phone and kept turning in the room, and asked me eagerly: ""Sigh it? See where I am?"" I saw it. The cement wall, the wooden boards horizontal and erect, and the father wearing a brick in work ... She came to Shanghai, and I was surprised for a moment. With her shot, I watched their current work. The rough room is very simple, there are four walls, waiting for workers such as dad. In a place to eat and sleep, the toilet is also temporarily installed, all of which are cement ash. Mom raised a plastic cloth and pointed at the two beds of bedding, saying that she and her father had a bed cushion and a bed cover last night. Although she slept on the ground, she didn't feel cold. The two paint buckets are covered with a hard cardboard, a plate of pickles fried tofu, a bowl of broad bean egg flower soup, and two bowls of rice. Their dinner is so simple. My heart hurts, and I couldn't help asking her: ""Do you think it is hard to work or plant the field in my hometown?"" My mother drank the soup and thought about it, ""It is not easy, but I am all of them. Don't feel tired. I don't worry about your dad's injured foot. Heel comes over to help him cook, and don't do anything physical work. I rarely come out in my life. The city ... ""In the eyes of her mother, this was the closest journey of her husband and daughter. After the call, I remembered that when she was young, her mother worked alone at home. Once she picked two barrels of water to pour the crops in the field. The sky was very hot. She walked in a hurry and was tripped by the stone without notice. I played at the side of the field, watching my mother falling with a bucket, and quickly ran over. My mother's hands and knees were scratched by stones and exuded blood. I cried suddenly, as if the injured person was me. Mom hugged me with a smile, patted my back and said, ""Don't cry, don't cry, mother doesn't hurt, mother is not tired ..."" Today's mother is not as young and powerful, her hair has been pale, she leaves her farming field. When I came to the city to be a dad's helper, smiled in the hard steel cement, and the clouds told me lightly: Mom is not tired, and does not hurt ... In the night, tears slipped in the corner of my eyes. ——Is thinking about this, I am depressed. The mother suddenly stopped talking and sighed. I was busy asking what happened. She couldn't help but say, ""Girl, when do you say this epidemic is over? I can't rest assured that she can't rest assured."" She can't rest assured? It is the longer and taller coriander; it is the germinated corn seeds unmanned; it is the too mature rapeseed ""snap la la"" to blew the ground ... The mother said, if people are in their hometown, it must definitely The ground was flipped a few times, and the rapeseed seeds were exposed to the field. The corn seedlings were very energetic, and people kept rest. I understand that my mother is a farmer, and at this moment it is a good time to plant the spring. She loves the cultivation, and she grows her hope on that land. People are happy with the growth of the crops. But now, in the rough room, in addition to making three meals a day in addition to the food distributed food, it is to listen to the arrangement for testing. She was anxious, but helpless. Only wait, wait for the unblocking, and when the transportation of Shanghai returning to her hometown is normal, she will go back immediately. Everyone is looking forward to. Some people are looking forward to resumption, some people look forward to going out to play, some people look forward to eating and drinking, some people look forward to reunion ... and my mother, she hopes to return to her hometown as soon as possible, return to her crops, stand in a large number of In front of the wheat field, watching the wind blowing the wheat waves, and the birds were busy than others.

Space,"Read a good book, you can understand a lot of truth","-about Dan Qinke's memoir ""Literary and Art Drama · Life""","Yang Yang turned around in the study these days, and wanted to find a good-looking book to recover. The memories that attracted me was the memoir ""Literature and Drama · Life"", the translator, It is the famous Mr. Jiao Juyin. Dan Qinke's name is no stranger to those who are familiar with drama. He is a great director of Russia from the end of the 19th century to the early 20th century. The biggest contribution of his life is to create the Moscow Art Theater with Stanisislavsky , Successfully moved to the stage of Chekhov's ""Seagull"", ""Three Sisters"" and ""Cherry Garden"". Stanni enhanced the stage experience of these drama performances into a systematic drama theory and established the Stanni system that swept the world. From the perspective of the drama, Dan Qinke did a very amazing thing. He first realized the potential value of Chekhov's drama, convinced Chekhov who lost confidence in drama creation, and agreed to rehearse ""Seagull"" rehearsing. It is also Dan Qinke persuaded Stanni and asked him to pay attention to the special features of Chekhov's drama different from any previous playwright works. I remember that in an article about drama in his later years, Mr. Wang Yuanhua had criticized the stiffness of Stanni's theoretical system, and attributed some valuable drama to Dan Qinke. From the memories of Dan Qinke, what I feel is not just inspiration in the art of drama, but the experience and essential literacy that all literary growth processes must experience. Before Dan Qinke succeeded, he experienced frustration and failure like many people, but he was not discouraged. He has his own artistic ideals and has come all the way. Because of his different ideas, he has to part ways with his former colleagues and friends. Until he met Stanislavski, the two of them co -authored and created the Moscow Art Theater to create a belonging to the Art Theater that belongs to the Art Theater of the Art Theater. The unique performance of the show eventually succeeded. The reason why Steini was able to cooperate with Dan Qinke, in addition to his mind that can accommodate Dan Qinke, is also related to the artistic concept. They are dissatisfied with the popular drama performances at the time. Art Theater. To establish an art theater, in addition to money, in addition to acting, the most important thing is to provide high -quality drama. According to the thoughts of the average person, find a fame, and rehearse some of the play in the history of the drama. However, the many directors of Dan Qinke who are higher than the same age lies in that he has abandoned the industry rules and chose a new road of drama performers unique to the Art Theater. He was the earliest aware of Chekhov's drama ""Seagull"" in line with the innovative concept of the Art Theater, and has huge artistic potential. This exploration process is also an extremely famous innovation case in the history of world art: ""Seagull"" was originally rehearsed by the St. Petersburg Theater, which is much larger than Moscow Art Theater. When staged in St. Petersburg, it failed completely. At that time, the spirit of the playwright Chekhov could be seen from Chekhov's letter. He was extremely frustrated and felt huge humiliation; he even doubted his drama writing talent, saying that he would never write a script again. When the Seagulls performed ""Seagull"" for the first time in the Moscow Art Theater, Chekhov hid in the field and did not dare to watch the performance. When the first act of the performance was just closed, the theater was silent for a long time, and the actors were almost desperate to cry. Suddenly, applause broke out in the audience. Success. In this process, the most stressful is director Dan Qinke. He not only persuaded Chekhov to agree to the rehearsal ""Seagull"", but also constantly reminded all the players including Stanni. ""Seagull"" is not an ordinary drama, and it is a great great drama in history. drama. I think this requires not only great courage, but also very high artistic appreciation. In the memoir, Dan Qinke recorded how he approached Chekhov in detail. In short, in the long -term drama watch director practice and drama teaching training, Dan Qinke saw the existing drama performance All kinds of deficiencies, germinating the idea of looking for a new way out, and finally found a breakthrough in Chekhov's drama. For the Moscow Art Theater, the rehearsal ""Seagull"" is a symbol. In the memoir, Dan Qinke said that the Moscow Art Theater has previously rehearsed other drama writers, but Russian critics agree that the Moscow Art Theater is from ""Seagull At the beginning of the rehearsal, it has its own logo and brand. It is not only the rehearsal of the repertoire, but also to implement its own set of drama standards to each specific rehearsal and performance link. Compared with some famous performance theater troupes in the world, it has formed a distinctive feature. This characteristic shows that this characteristic shows that The innovation and leadership of the Moscow Art Theater in artistic concepts has attracted many theater troupes worldwide to follow the world, which has extensive impact on world drama. The Moscow Art Theater is a model learned by Chinese drama artists. When it comes to the Art Theater, people will unconsciously think of Chekhov's drama. Mr. Jiao Juyin translated Dan Qinke's memoirs during the difficulty of the Anti -Japanese War in the 1940s. This choice reflects the ideal character and artistic knowledge of Chinese drama artists. Jiao Juyin is a graduate of Yanjing University. He studied in the University of Paris, France in 1935. He received a doctorate in 1938. After returning to China, he served as a professional teacher of many art schools. He left the college because he was dissatisfied with the bad habits in the teaching process and translated and introduced foreign drama works. In addition to the translation of Dan Qinke's memoirs, Jiao Juyin also translated Chekhov's ""Ivanov"", ""Seagull"", ""Vannia"", ""Three Sisters"" and ""Cherry Garden"" and introduced it to Chinese readers. He is a loyal practitioner of the theory of Danislavsky, China, but it is Jiao Juyin. He first raised national and national style issues in the field of Chinese drama. As the first director of the Beijing People's Art Theater, Mr. Jiao Juyin uses the Moscow Art Theater as an ideal benchmark in his mind. He hopes that the Beijing Renren Arts will have a series of outstanding performances that belong to their own unique brand like Moscow Art Theater. Guo Moruo's historical drama ""Tiger Faculty"" and ""Cai Wenji"", Lao She's ""Dragon Sutra"" has a good performance, but the most iconic drama is his ""Tea House"" directed by his director. ""Tea House"" is in Beijing's artistic art, like ""Seagull"" to the Moscow Art Theater. Since then, Chinese drama people have used such a play standards to demand Chinese drama art. A series of links related to drama have clear standards and specifications. Therefore, some commentators believe that ""Tea House"" is not only an excellent drama, but also the highest model of the ""national drama"" in New China. However, this ""national drama"" is not the result of the instilling will of the state, but the results of a group of outstanding drama artists like Jiao Juyin and Lao She's long -term efforts. The memoirs are constantly drawing strength. In the post -translation post, Mr. Jiao Juyin has a long text explaining her intimate relationship with this translation. In the most difficult trough of life, he rely on translating this book to seek spiritual support. From this book, he saw the future and value of engaging in the drama. Reading such enthusiastic text and looking back at Dan Qinke's memory content, you will think that translation is not just a language conversion, but also like the soul communication between different cultures, just like Fu Lei translated Roman Roland's """" John Klisdov ""and"" Biography of Beethoven ""really played a spiritual role of inspiring people.

Space,Leek Jiuxiang,Space,"Xiaoyu did not like to eat vegetables when I was a child, especially hate vegetables with strange flavors, such as celery, garlic, coriander, leeks, etc. I realized that all kinds of vegetables have their own unique nutritional value, forcing themselves to accept strange taste, and gradually gradually gradually accepted the strange taste. Passive becomes active, grievances become enjoyment, and even love. And the one I love the most should be counted as chives. But ordinary vegetables that can be bought everywhere in China have become rare in Germany. When I first arrived in Germany in 1999, I saw a small Chinese leek in the Asian supermarket in the city. The price was 20 marks per kilogram, which scared me this ""good leek"". Essence Later, I went to Frankfurt to see a Chinese restaurant ""Leek pork steamed dumplings"". The combination of these three words immediately killed my nostalgia and hurry up. But steamed dumplings were put on the table, and it was disappointed after bite: Leeks are like green onions, sparse sporadic embellishment, and pork is full of the protagonist. Only in a simple and even old Shanghai restaurant in a Hamburg family, I have tasted the most appreciated and most authentic and delicious leek steamed dumplings I have experienced in Germany. A piece of green green, the mouth is full of fragrance. In a certain year at the Frankfurt's girlfriend Hong family, she tasted the leek pork dumplings she tailing in the forest. I was so excited that I had the same dumplings that had the same taste as my dad in Germany. At this point, I thought that German wild leek is similar to Chinese leek. Walking or cycling in the wild, always searching in the forest and grass, but never found it. More than ten years ago, on Sunday, May, the Chinese school in Nuremberg in the neighboring city wanted to organize wild leeks to make dumplings. My half -old child was also excited, but the road conditions were not familiar. Parents and students who waited for leeks in the restaurant returned, and I was surprised to see that German wild leeks were like Mayland! It grows tall and plump without losing softness! But it tastes stronger than planting leeks. Therefore, the Chinese called the German called ""Bärlauch"", which is called ""wild leek"", which is easy to remember. At that time, the children who grew up with bread cheese (Asians who grew up in the West) were also attracted to the seductive temptation like me, a half -road immigrant. Boil dumplings at the same time at the same time are too late to supply dumplings. There are always friends who hold empty disks to wait in line to wait for the stove. In order to compensate myself to catch up with the shortcomings of picking leeks, in that year of my celebration, I cheekily put forward the ""non -score requirements"" that I was embarrassed to mention to the two friends: take me to pick chives. Although it was in late May, it was overpaid according to the Germans, but I waited for the ""leek lunatic"" to not listen to this, and my interest was still full of interest. A Ping, who took the leeks last time, volunteered to be a guide; Yingying drove the Audi car with full oil. We drove to Lauf 50 kilometers, but A Ping couldn't remember the exact hillside, and we couldn't see the leeks. Fortunately, the sun was bright that day, although I couldn't pick up the wild leek, I was in a mood. Later, after moving to Beiwei Prefecture, I still couldn't find wild leek. I could only buy 100 grams of 1.69 euros in the German supermarket. (This year has risen to 1.99 euros per 100 grams)! Send it once. I also went to other cities to find Wenyou, and made a special tour for friends and picking vegetables. A local Chinese couple Tao and Juan, knowing that I like leeks, I often send me their own Chinese leeks, comfort my Chinese stomach and warm my Chinese heart. Before the epidemic, he moved back to his husband in the small village in Bavaria. This spring, because of my persistence and luck, I found a green color in the forest and felt like wild leek. But I was afraid that the similar toxic May lily of the valley was missed again, and then rubbed the leaves and rubbed the leaves. When a strong flavor of fragrant chives hit the nasal cavity, it was really ecstatic: I found ""Leek for 20 years. ""Lu, discovered with his own eyes, the pride of the nearest end was ended. Leek, it is also a ""long"" dish, which contains long -lasting and lush nostalgia, affection, and friendship. Father born in Shandong likes to eat leek pork dumplings during his lifetime. At the age of 19, he crossed Jiangnan, and later he could go to his hometown to visit his elderly because he settled in Jiangnan and busy work. But as long as he made and eaten chives and pork dumplings, it was as if he tasted the delicious cooked by his mother, and the scene with his parents reproduced through the scene of the taste buds, and his body and soul were doubled. Now in Germany, I enjoy the Chinese style made by the wild leek given by nature, as if the thousands of thousands of kilometers of thousands of kilometers away from the domestic loved ones are also shortened to ""zero"" at once.

Many citizens are concerned that if a positive infection appears in a building, will the residents of this building be separated? How to scientifically determine the secret and sub -dense crowds? Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, gave a detailed answer. The judgment of the confidential and secondary dense connection (that is, the closely connected tightly) is the requirements of epidemiological investigative professionals in accordance with the requirements of the state and the city's relevant prevention and control work plan, combined with the suggestions of the national expert group and the results of epidemiological surveys and big data. Check the information to make a comprehensive judgment. Among them, secret connection refers to the beginning of 4 days before the symptoms of suspected cases and confirmed cases, or asymptomatic infected specimens from 4 days before the sample sample samples, instead of those who have close contact but have not taken effective protection, or are exposed to the possible pollution environment. Personnel and so on. Second -secret refers to frequent contact with the above -mentioned close -to -residence, work and learning. If the positive infection is strict static managers (that is, non -liquidity under strict management, including those who do not leave home), if their home has independent kitchen and house conditions, the person who lives with them is closely connected, and instead of them, instead of them, instead of themselves The same floor and the residents on the upper and lower floors are secondary secret; if their residence does not have independent kitchen care conditions, then in addition to the person who lives together with them, the kitchen and bathrooms live on the same floor or the same village house on the same floor or the same village houses. The daily contact persons must also be judged to be secretly connected, and other residents of the building/village house where their buildings are located are secondary.

Space,Waiting for the snow overnight,Space,"For nearly two months of Peng Rui, there are often things in the community. This is the one that happened in the southern district. A man who had a legitimate year of heyday had just sent his father into the peacefulness in the hospital, but received a call and control call, saying that he was abnormal in nucleic acid. What is his state of mind at this time? How would you choose to go? He drove the car, and his father's legacy appeared in front of him. The pale face stared at the bed for two weeks, and he had been deeply engraved in his heart. His father suffered from acute leukemia. The hospital entered on April 9 was suffering from the epidemic. The hospital did not have relevant outpatient clinics and surgery. He called his father countless times, and at this moment he was still calling ... In the past half a month, he took care of his father at the hospital alone, and no one had replaced him. He now wants to see two women -mothers and wives. He wanted to tell them that his father had everything before leaving; he had to discuss with them, and the epidemic was about to do the funeral of his father. He is also eager to see his baby. My father wanted to see your baby before his death. If it wasn't for the control, he would hold his baby into the bed and let his father look at it at the end. The child is still ignorant. If he stepped into the house, he asked him in the first sentence: ""Dad, what about my grandpa?"" At that time, how did he answer? The left neighbor and right, and then he will come to ask him, ""How about Grandpa?"" What should he answer? Thinking of so many neighbors, he rose a warm feeling in his heart. He remembered the scene of his father hurriedly left the community on the day of his illness. In those days, he was just selected by the neighbors as the ""lord"" of Nongtang. There are nearly a thousand residents in the community. There are dozens of ""lords"" like him, which belongs to the leader of volunteers. Every time the nucleic acid test, he has to arrange the time to applaud the residents to prevent the people from the pre -vehicle gathered; each time the antigen detection, he has to distribute the reagent, collect the results, and report to the doctor; , Offline receipt, also take the lead in donation (this time he just donated 1,500 yuan). The busiest and most tired and most lively is the distribution of government ""big gift packages"". That day he would drive to the gate, put all the gift packages, and send them to each door. When distributing this gift package, Lane is like a holiday. Behind a glass door and above a mask, there is a pair of smiling eyes ... The community, Nongtang, neighbor next door ... Thinking of this, he suddenly tightened. He didn't go home for more than half a month, but he watched the WeChat group in the community every day. The immune-up of the North District has basically controlled it, and the southern district continues to maintain a pure land; the community has not been unblocked, but the voice of ""Zero-Covid"" has been faintly heard. How nice the pronunciation of these two words is. For these two words, the North District of the South District was almost split, and more than 2,000 Fang neighbors stayed hard ... He turned on the right turn and stopped slowly on the side of the road. He felt that he couldn't go forward. Don't say that the disease control notifying him nucleic acid abnormalities is normal, and he feels that he cannot enter the community. After all, I spent so long in the hospital. What if I bring the virus? Infecting his wife and children is not counted, it also needs to harm the neighbors. Is this what people do? He drove the car into the parking lot and found a parking space. He used his mobile phone to tell the Center for the Center for Disease Control, then put down his seat, lay his body flat, and waited for a doctor to do a nucleic acid review. A few hours later, the doctor came to sample and told him, please wait patiently to wait for the review result. He still waited in the car and drank a little mineral water. He premones correctly: I later notified him that the nucleic acid reviewed results were positive. He froze for a moment, and his body was exhausted for many days, but he was relaxed at once. He is still waiting in the car. The doctor said that he would send an ambulance and transfer him to the square hospital. This waited for a long time, until the ambulance with a police lamp drove beside him, he pushed the door. At this time he had waited for a day and one night. After getting out of the car, he glanced at the east, and the morning light in the sky was slightly bright. This is what people call dawn? Wait overnight to stop the snow.

Space,Simple and sincere Liu Zifeng,Space,"Wang Zhengyu really couldn't believe it, Liu Zifeng left. He walked so hastily, so suddenly, it was too late to write an article when he got together with him, and he would not say goodbye. I once wanted to visit him, talk about performances with him, talk about movies, and talk about calligraphy, but because of an unpredictable epidemic, everything can't be like it, everything can only leave pain and regrets in the time of disappearance. Zi Feng and I met in the movie ""Fake Girl True Love"". The film director Wu Zhen chose a group of good actors. Zhong Xinghuo, Wei Zongwan, Xi Meijuan, Liu Zifeng, etc. were already famous. Zi Feng and Xi Meijuan played a couple, Lao Ding and Wang Yujuan. This is a very ordinary family. Because of ordinary, the performance of the two of them is also very ""ordinary"" and very life. Both people at home were cooking, while saying lines, they were not acting at all. I didn't shoot much in the camera. One day, the photography Qu Jiazhen said to Mei Meijuan: ""Your movie may get the Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Awards."" I pushed Jian Zhen: ""You see Zifeng's scene, and he is very life."" Qu Jiazhen said in a word. Among them, Sure enough, Xi Meijuan won the double prize with this film. I was a friend with the photographer. Afterwards, we also talked about Liu Zifeng. He said that Zifeng had not played much in the film, but he was the excellent green leaves of the red flowers. Liu Zifeng is not tall, and there is no handsome guy. The thin head of his hair cannot be comparable to those beautiful handsome guys today. But he is his acting skills, and the superb acting skills can be uncomfortable. When I was a student, I saved a small pocket money, I went to see Lenin he played, and was amazed. I believed that Lenin, who was acting with Gao Chong, a human art, had its own characteristics. His fame is the ""Black Cannon Incident"", which is a classic in the history of Chinese film. In the crew, Zifeng and I talked about the movie. He told me that before the filming, he cried and made a lot of preparations before shooting. He had many ideas for acting as an ordinary person. An ordinary engineer lost a chess piece ""black cannon"", which led to a great event. This black humor was completely performed through a simple performance. I expressed sighing, Ke Zifeng used the Shanghai dialect, ""My forehead is tall!"" ""I met such a good director and such a good creative team ..."" I was the deputy director in ""The True Love of the Fake Girl"". Assist the director's work. Once, starring Mei Meijuan went out from the house to call his husband's shot. As soon as he was about to start, I hurriedly stopped. The director asked, why? I said that her camera outside the door was wearing a bib during shooting a few days ago. Now this lens does not have a bibbon, and she will not be able to pick it up in the future. The lens of the film and television drama is not in the order of the plot, but in the scene. The director immediately called for a review. Sure enough, the clothing was quickly modified, and then shot it. Afterwards, Zifeng smiled and asked: ""You can see it early, are you waiting for the director to shout and stop it?"" I was busy: ""How dare you dare, really started to find it!"" He patted my shoulder: ""You are really serious."" I said, ""It's all learned with you!"" He laughed ... the past was like a smoke, and he was in your calendar. The Sri Lanka had gone, and his voice was still in his ears. Liu Zifeng and I have common hobbies and calligraphy. However, he wrote cursive script, and I practiced Lishu and Xingshu. I am very strange that his person is not tall, he can write such a high scripture and proud cursive script, and he is a close friend with Yang Zaizheng in cursive calligraphy. I asked, he laughed without answering. In the old saying, people cannot look at each other, and the seawater cannot fight. This is too! In the summer season, Chun Lei, who was booming, had rolled away. Shanghai, our mother's city has undergone unwavering tribls. I wanted to visit Zifeng after the epidemic ended, talked about art, and talked about calligraphy, but all this became a dream. Touching the years, crossing the long river, we look for memories in time, and in the time, we retrograde and crossed the old old. Maybe you dominate life, might let your life dominate you.

""The basic situation of all the elderly people in the community has actually found in our hearts, but we still have to call regularly every day to understand their latest state. If they have special needs and difficulties, we can master After the phone, the neighborhood committee decided to send the newly -to -life materials to the hands of the elderly living alone. Soon, after checking and distributed the supplies, several staff members put on the protective clothing and took good materials, and set off from the neighborhood committee. The community in the sealing and silent community seemed to be extraordinarily silent at this moment, and we can only see the busy figures of community workers and volunteers. They walked back and forth between the buildings, and some were busy inspecting the order of each building; some riding a tricycle and a battery car to distribute materials from house to house; near lunch time, there were also busy old food aid old meals. Send to the old man's house. ""Grandma Lin, we brought some vegetables over, including cauliflower, white radish, zucchini, Shanghai green, and peach crisp, milk powder, honey, canned food ..."" Seeing various materials occupied the table, 73 -year -old Lin Ai Ling Said surprise: ""Thank you so much, it's really rainy in time. The vegetables I bought a few days ago are about to eat it. What should I do? Still the phone number? What happened to us as soon as possible! ""In less than 1 hour, all 36 elderly people living alone received the supplies of the material. Under the patience of the staff, the psychological anxiety of the old people in the sealing and silent period also faded away. ""If you have anything, find the cadres and volunteers of the neighborhood committee. Like family members, they are at ease. I feel that the epidemic will pass soon."" Lin Songlin, 83, told reporters. ""During the closed and silent management of the community, the care and service guarantee of special groups such as the elderly living alone is the top priority of our community work."" It is understood that the elderly over 60 or more in the residential area of Wanrong Xinyuan, Pengpu Town, Jing'an District There are 2,358 people (67 elderly people over 90 years old), accounting for more than 38%of the population, including 143 households in the elderly and 338 pure old families. For elderly people who live alone, live alone, and have inconvenient actions, the community will contact the situation through telephone and other methods to understand and master the situation in a timely manner, help the elderly carry out nucleic acid test registration, and assist in delivery and delivery of living materials. At the same time, many ""old partner programs"" volunteers and pairing care objects pass a phone call every day to provide care and care through ""remote companion"", and accept the call from the elderly and their families for 24 hours. For some rigid demands of the elderly in the community during the sealing and control management period, such as food assistance, home care, and pills, the neighborhood committees do their best to provide one -on -one door -to -door services on the premise of strictly implementing protective measures. Work to make the elderly feel at ease and rest assured to be home. Our correspondent Huang Xiaoqing reporter Jiang Yuezhong Emergency 120 sent to the hospital for the third class to take care of it for 24 hours and 70s. Seeing this scene, the cadres of the Fudan neighborhood committee of the Five Corporation Street in the district, quickly dial 120, and contacted the elderly's daughter. Unexpectedly, the old man's daughter was unwilling to rush to take care of his father and even turned off his mobile phone. what to do? With the support of the street office, the cadres of the neighborhood committee decided to come forward to the ""filial piety"", not only paid the medical expenses of thousands of yuan after being sent to the hospital, but also for 24 hours to take care of it for 24 hours. Old man with infusion tube. Fortunately, after the joint efforts of the Fudan neighborhood committee and the residence of the elderly daughter's residence, one and a half later, the elderly's daughter finally appeared in the hospital. However, the cadres of the neighborhood committees did not have an end to the elderly. The old man was a lonely man, and his physical condition was not very good. The cadres of the neighborhood committee kept worrying. Before the control on April 1, he contacted his daughter to arrange for the old meal to send the door. Although his daughter had only paid a day for his meal, the cadres of the neighborhood committee still insisted on saving the elderly from their work meals every day. On May 7th, when the cadres of the residents came to the door, the state of the elderly could already be described as weak when they opened the door. The body was soft and her conscious. There were several box lunches that had not been eaten on the table, which was very critical. The cadres of the neighborhood committee quickly dial 120, and at the same time contacted the daughter who lived in Baoshan District. In fact, since the sealing and control, the cadres of the neighborhood committee have dialed 120 for the elderly several times, and the ambulance has also come to the entrance of the community several times, but because her daughter refused to come forward. This time, the attitude of the old man's daughter still did not change, and he still repeatedly asked, ""Why don't I come here?"" ""You send me a car to pick me up to the hospital, then what do I go back?"" ... but only the word does not mention the father's condition. The cadres of the neighborhood committees knew that their daughter had a heart -knotting with her father because of their parents' divorce, but the life -saving moment could not wait or hesitate. Under the anxiety, several people moved their heads, and some were ready to go to the hospital to take care of the elderly with the car; ; However, after more than an hour, she turned off. The cadres of the residential committee sank: What should I do? At this time, the blood pressure of the elderly was rapidly declining, and it was urgent. Li Xiaping, the secretary of the cadre of the street station in the street, and the secretary of the Fudan residents' district party branch, briefly discussed a few words, and the camera was interrupted: ""The life of life is closed, and the cadres of the neighborhood committee go up!"" Deputy Director Tao Jingxi and a street sinking cadre put on a protective suit, drilled into an ambulance, and drove to Changhai Hospital in the sound of whistle. When they arrived at the hospital, the blood pressure of the old man rose to 220mmHg! Fortunately, after a circle of inspection, coupled with the treatment of infusion, the elderly's spirit was better. When Tao Jingxi's nervous nerves wanted to relax, the elderly who resumed a certain ability to move suddenly suddenly reached out and tried to pull out the infusion tube on her body. Tao Jingxi hurriedly calmed the emotions of the elderly while controlling the behavior of the elderly. When the emotions of the elderly stabilized, the two had already been sweating, but because of the special environment and wearing protective clothing, the two took the ambulance in the evening until they left the hospital at midnight to leave the hospital at midnight , I haven't even drunk it. At noon on the 8th, the cadres of the neighborhood committee finally opened the call of the elderly daughter again. In the evening, she took a special car arranged by the Pentai Street. She took care of the elderly for more than 24 hours. Three days have passed, and the life indicators of the elderly are still unstable. So far, they can only eat through the nose. The cadres of the neighborhood committees are still thinking about the weak old man: not only arranged the cleaning staff to clean up the elderly's original and smelling home, and cleaned it up, and arranged a one -to -one caregiver for him in the hospital. I also found a nursing home, and suggested that her daughter sent the elderly who could not take care of their own life to specialized institutions in the future ... A possible tragedy was resolved, and this ""top up"" was actually the front -line staff of the community. Everyday.

Space ,The mystery in my heart ended ,Space ,"Ye Xin entered March, and the epidemic gradually became severe. A thick book ""Tea and Empires"" I read with my energy is 500,000 words. This is not a novel, but a work related to tea -related works by History Professor Elica Lap Port. In the era of educated youth, I planted tea, picked tea, and fried tea with farmers. After becoming a writer, the only companion during writing is a cup of tea. The dating between the literati is sent to the sending two things: books and tea. In 2015, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government hired me to serve as the Guizhou Tea Culture Ambassador. In addition to the tea in the mountains and townships from all over Guizhou, I went to various places to collect the customs with writers. I have been to the producing areas of Liu'an Gua tablets, to the core production area of ​​Xinyang Maojian, Guzhang Maojian, and Duyong Maojian, and several Fujian tea led by Anxi Tieguanyin, Longjing, Biluochun, and Huangshan Maofeng near Shanghai The rising shows such as Zunyi Hong, Pu'anhong, Meitan Li Xiang Tea, Wind Zinc Dan Tea, Cuiya, Tea in Liping Township, etc., are not only one by one, but also talk about it more or less. I have written more than a dozen articles related to tea, read books and theory related to tea written by tea experts in China, but I have not read tea books written by foreigners. This ""Tea and Empires"" turned out to be a monograph. The reason why I read it in detail with a chapter and one chapter in detail. In my case, I hope to open up my horizons and answer my mystery in my heart. The ancestors of tea are China, but why did foreigners make tea culture so as? Ren Tea Culture Ambassador, I will attend the seminar every year, and discuss with international and domestic tea experts at the meeting. I cannot repeat a topic. In the minds of ordinary Shanghai people, as long as they talk about tea, they will naturally mention the afternoon tea of ​​the British (many British writers are involved). In fact, due to regional, climate, and history, Britain has no tea gardens. However, the British have almost the extreme of tea culture. Of course, the value of tea has also greatly increased. The province in Guizhou now has 7 million acres of tea trees, tea township, tea, and tea gardens. However, in the process of poverty alleviation and rural rejuvenation in all ethnic groups, most of them only know that the tea is planted, collected, and processed well. Although benefits and quality are obvious, there is still quite room for improvement. In mid -March, I took advantage of the gap of the meeting to go back to the hometown of Dongxiang, Miao Village, and Buyi Zhai Zhaizhai to re -travel. They encountered a lot of Zhejiang tea merchants. They all came to the mountains to purchase tea, and they praised them. Guizhou Tea in remote countryside is good and cheap. The book ""Tea and Empires"" traces the rise and fall of the tea empire from western Canada to the east of India, involving many topics related to tea. Tea and women, tea and war, tea gardens, tea companies, processing and tea trading markets And various activities related to tea reveal the role of tea and tea drinking habits on the contemporary world. In the process of reading carefully, I have a lot of gains and thinking in combination with China and Guizhou tea. When I read the chapter of ""Tea Makes the World's Spirit"" in the book, I also quite agree with it. Drinking tea is good for people's health, and is almost the consensus of the world. Naturally, it is also good for Shanghai people. In July 2020, Jiangsu Literature and Art Publishing House published my novel ""Soul""; in the first half of this year, the writer publishing house was about to publish another long article ""Marriage"". I heard that I was writing ""Love"", and some publishing houses came to say that they hope to give them. Because the content of ""Love"" is not the same as the first two books, since the beginning of the spring, I read the three popular love novels. These three books are ""Lovers"", ""Love One"" and ""Love Life"", both of which are old books I have collected. I also read a few new works this year. Two books are 108 -year -old old writer, and it is also my new work for my forgetful year: one is ""such an era, such a person"", and the other is ""Horseson Tutu Southwest. Research on Oracle of the University of United University. I have met Ma Lao for 40 years. The major he studied in his youth was Oracle Study, and I never heard him talk about it. It can be seen that Ma Lao's person and character. I remember 40 years ago he took the initiative to give me a calligraphy work. After being transferred back to Shanghai, I sent his character out to mount. People saw the words of the old writer so well. Essence I have never disclosed to the outside world. By the way, I also know a small writing in the wine industry that I have written to me. Although he has died, he wrote an order for my wine book ""Decrypted Qian Terrace"", which is my pillow book. Two calligraphy, I often read with the psychology of appreciation. In order to give me the preface to the essay ""Rural Life"" of the old friend Zhang Jiachun many years ago, I also read this book from beginning to end. I really read the current status and folk customs of Sandu, the only aquarium autonomous county in the country. Especially the unmarried men, old people and children in the countryside have a new understanding. After being published by the Central Party School Press, this book was quickly recommended by the Central Propaganda Department as a must -read for cadres at all levels of rural areas.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/6.htm,5/11/22,Edition 6: Nightlight Cup ,
Space,"Everyone's ""Love Youth League""",Space,"Yin Jianling's 1404 appointed alumni: Aoyama is the same as the wind and rain. There is no need to communicate frequently. Alumni who are half a century apart can fly around for a day. Thank you, when we are in trouble, we have sent enthusiastic help ... The paper that writes the note is the 90 -year -old man Yan Fengxia and the 93 -year -old Tang Yunxiang of the 90 -year -old man. One of the members of the Tongdong Love Youth League. A epidemic, holding each other's familiar neighbors together; in just one month, the building with 97 residents of 97 households can spontaneously give birth to a special folk organization: a love youth group. Said to be a youth group, not all members are young people. The sponsor Jiang Hong and Hong Yun, one is the general manager of the former Shanghai Mengniu Dairy Co., Ltd., and the other is the classic 947 host of Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station. with love. Some members of the Youth League are the company's financial and personnel supervisors, and some are versatile music teachers who teach Guzheng while opening pet shops. In the words of Jiang Hong, youth is not in the physiological age, but the psychological forever. On April 7, Jiang Hong found that the green leaf vegetables at home were not enough to eat, and they went to the community to buy it. Hong Yun, who lived downstairs, told Jiang Hong that after a few group purchases, she found that the orders in Building No. 2 were the least in the entire community. She guessed that a large part of the reason was that there were many elderly people. If the elderly who live alone and the empty nest elderly people do not have the assistance of the same living, how will they carry this time if they will not buy them? Jiang Hong didn't dare to think. She suggested Hong Yun that we will build a group by ourselves to help the elderly who will not buy online in the building. At least, let the elderly eat milk and eggs! The two of them were closed. After that, several enthusiastic partners were invited to join, each of which performed their duties: Virgo partners who were responsible for personnel and finance in the company were responsible for making group purchases, and the guzheng teacher who opened the pet shop was responsible for making group purchase links. Lou Dong's friends are responsible for picking up the group and distributing supplies ... Soon, the Love Youth League has led to the entire building, and the No. 2 love group of ""not settled one house"" was established. , Milk, eggs, fruits, cake snacks, and disinfection supplies ... Hong Yun is ready to answer questions for the elderly groups in the love group, how to change my nickname in the group Demonstration videos of group purchase steps ... The Love Youth Group collected a list of lone and elderly people in the entire community. The residents of the Building 2 have been purchased. The residential and elderly people of other buildings also received love breakfast and fruit at the same time. Hong Yun launched an initiative in the group: donating love red envelopes, and stipulated that the amount per household does not exceed 10 yuan. Ten yuan seems to be insignificant, but the reason is enough: ""We are love groups, not to offer love for the field, and all neighbors must participate in it without comparison, but to continue the love when needed."" Thank you for serving the neighborhood committees and property staff; Dabai volunteers stationed in Building 2 will be transferred away; giving a love breakfast to the elderly in the community ... There are many opportunities for everyone to provide love. The whole building will respond. Some neighbors think that ten yuan is too little and want to donate more. The love group said: ""No, this is the rules."" Love is really not measuring money. What they value is that love can be implemented and can stretch for a long time. Isn't the neighbors holding a love? Dabbai didn't take a bath for more than ten days, and neighbors donated their own buckets, hot water bottles, kettle, shampoo, shower gel; Dabai who stationed in the controlled building was about to be adjusted, and everyone raised funds to express thank you ... … When the material needs are met, neighbors need spiritual relief and comfort. Come on the love concert on the cloud! The Love Youth League planned a unique cloud love concert on the cloud. Hong Yun, the host of the classical music show, naturally became a planner and organizer. Sure enough, the concert aroused the expectations of many elderly people. On the evening of April 22, it became the sleeping night of Building 2. The ten -year -old child played the pipa ""Jasmine"", the 85 -year -old grandmother sang ""The Solo River"", and the Beijing opera tickets sang ""Wisdom to the Tiger Mountain"", and Hong Yun himself sang a ""Little Love Song"". Hong Yun's father trained the violin for two days for the show and recorded it over and over again. ""Dad has something to do, especially attentive, very happy."" Hong Yun said. The concert last night lasted for three hours, and the neighbors were still overwhelmed. ""The emoticons are not enough."" For everyone, the neighbors who had only encountered in the elevator room had a new understanding of each other, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones. It is found that this is an unprecedented condensed. Love is energy and star fire. Nowadays, more different buildings in small differences have joined the ""Love Youth League"". ""'Love Youth League' will not end with the end of the epidemic, and it will continue and grow. The epidemic is just the beginning of us.

"I don't know your name, but I know that angels are around","Today, pay tribute to ""Goddess of Lantern""",Space,"hug. The head nurse of the emergency rescue room is the ""housekeeper"" here -not only to cooperate with doctors to participate in the treatment, but also coordinate the prevention and control of the management area. Facing the surge in the volume of consultation, Chen Jiao led the nursing team to repeatedly adjust the emergency process and strictly control various prevention and control measures. Since the epidemic, the emergency response of Xinhua Hospital has been open to the state of rescue tasks. people. Faced with huge pressure on work, Chen Jiao devoted himself to it like a ""firefire member"". She is accustomed to working for more than ten hours a day or even a continuous sleep ... When she encounters a critical patient, she always rises in front and protects young colleagues behind them. Facing the emotional family members, she can always be professional. Care and patiently appear to explain ... There are more than 30 nurses in the rescue room, and more than 20 nurses in emergency severe care rooms. Chen Jiao told reporters that there are many young people here, including many young mothers. The nurses are not surprised. They must be saved, safe, and love. She said that she thanked her family, especially her son's understanding and recognition of his job. At 8 am, Li Ping, the nurse of the blood purification center of Renji Hospital, put on protective clothing, entered the hemodrochemical, pretend to be an analysis instrument, prepare the machine, and treat it for patients ... For patients with uremia The hemodialysis machine and the pipelines connected to the continuation of the lifeline. Not long ago, the 68 -year -old Zhao Lao had a sudden acute left heart failure. He had difficulty breathing and cough. If he did not immediately treat hemodialysis, he would be in danger of life. After receiving the call, Li Ping couldn't take a rest and immediately rushed to the ward. Put on the protective clothing to measure the signs of life, blood pressure, heart rate and weight, and perform blood transparency. Two hours later, the symptoms of heart failure of Laobo were relieved. ""Later, we learned that Lao Zhao recently had a somewhat relaxed self -management, he had not controlled his diet, and he had a sudden heart failure."" Although it was a small thing, Li Ping also remembered. Li Ping hasn't returned home for nearly two months. He joined the work in 2000 and became a nurse in the hemodium -optic room in 2010. Li Ping is about to usher in the 23rd Nurses' Day in his career. ""Since engaging in this occupation, it will inevitably encounter such difficulties. But saving the professional pride of career during life is unable to provide other occupations. Whenever we successfully rescue a patient, save a life, or help help When a family, all the hard work and tiredness, including grievances, is worth it. ""Li Ping said. The residents of nucleic acid samples are worthy of ""looking up, opening their mouths, and soon."" When the nucleic acid sampling is sampled, such soft words, I believe you and I are no stranger. Since this round of epidemic, many nurses have been struggling to fight the front line in nucleic acid detection. Compared with nurse clothes and toll -end hats, they have wrapped themselves for longer with protective clothes. Regardless of weekends and holidays, in the morning or late at night, they can see their persistence in temporary nucleic acid monitoring points and in building buildings. Zhang Yu and Luo Wenting are two of them. In their opinion, the active cooperation and understanding of each citizen is to give them the best holiday gifts. From the initial sampling sampling for the secret and secondary intercourse, to the time when the screening was screened, the three -wheeled ""stalls"" in the community, Zhang Yu, the nurse of Shanghai Oriental Hospital, could not remember how many nucleic acid samples had been involved. When the epidemic happened, he needed to review the single -managing citizen. At that time, Zhang Yu followed the sample team to sampling from house to house after contacting the neighborhood committee. From noon to the early morning of the next day. At that time, many players shook their hands so much that they could not even lift their arms, but now, Zhang Yu, who has been used to it, can easily deal with each task. The girl who has been working for less than a year remembers the most firm thing is not hard work, but the movement of harvesting at work -on the day of the sampling of Huamu Street, the storms are overwhelming. The vests are prepared to protect the cold; the old people in the old community are inconvenient to move. They need to sample at the door. Grandpa and grandma thank you sincerely. It is worthwhile. Under the epidemic, Zhang Yu's daily work is nervous and busy, you need to sample from time to time, need to be on duty in the department, and need a positive infection. The girl said that the career of the nurse is very sacred. Do it in your life. Luo Wenting is the nurse of the community health service center of Pengpu Town, Jing'an District. Recently, her main task is to ""chase the sun"" and ""check the lack of gaps"" with colleagues. ""The early screening has touched the point situation. Now it is necessary to replenish the missing crowds in some buildings. Usually, there are more old, weak, and disabled. For her, although the intensity of her work was not as big as a while ago, there were a lot of physical requirements, because many husbands had no elevators, and they kept climbing to the door. Not long ago, when she participated in the sampling work of the door -to -door nucleic acid, she accidentally fell in order to avoid the rider's brother who suddenly appeared in the intersection. She said that at that time, I thought that there were three buildings that needed to be sampled, and her heart was relatively anxious. I just checked whether the protective suit was damaged. I didn't think much about it. I immediately took the sampling materials and went upstairs. After the mission returned home, I touched the swollen calf, and found that I scratched several places, but I couldn't feel the pain completely at work. Everyone knows ""hard work"" in the sampling process. Luo Wenting said that the resident's sentence ""Thank you, hard work"" made her feel relieved. As a grass -roots health worker, Luo Wenting said: ""Raising hands again and again, the number of steps a day is the 'transcript' of grass -roots health workers. I hope to usher in the victory of resistance to epidemic early. Smile face.

Thinking back on March 2nd four years ago, I was or Teacher Qin Yi. At that time, when I met, I yelled infinitely. That day was the Lantern Festival. The Shanghai Literature and Art circles held the New Year Tea Club in the Literature and Art Hall. The artist representatives from the city's literary and art circles gathered together to congratulate the New Year. The Wuxu is the Year of the Dog. Therefore, the tea will choose a representative from each round of the dog who belongs to the dog. I was the ""dog"" on behalf of the 1950s, and the biggest ""dog"" that day was the 96 -year -old teacher Qin Yi. Before I came to power, I went to Teacher Qin Yi first -the ""dogs"" from the 1940s to the 1990s were sitting next to a round table. Being with us, not to speak on the stage. I told her ""Proponing"": ""Teacher Qin, when I went up in a while, what did you want me to say?"" She smiled and said to me, ""You shouted a few more"" Wang Wang "" ""So, my heart led the gods and called eight"" Wang Wang ""on the stage. Of course, it was not learning dog barks, but"" Wangwang "". As I called at Teacher Qin Yi, she was looking at me and patted me. In fact, the teacher Qin Yi was not very comfortable that day.

She played the white -headed maid in the movie. The role was shocking because of her final death, but some people said that she should not play such a character. Teacher Qin Yi smiled indifferently when he heard it. I thought in my heart that only real artists would understand that the decisiveness in the play is definitely a real life. This can understand why she went to Qinghai in her 90s, endured the plateau reaction, and persisted to complete the most special film in her film career- ""Qinghai Lakeside"". This film was written and starred by Mr. Qin Yi himself. With the construction of the Qinghai -Tibet Railway as the background, it tells the story of scientists represented by a female meteorological engineer to overcome difficulties on the plateau on the plateau. Teacher Qin Yi told me that she had only germinated the idea of filming the movie after hearing a real story. She really devoted her wholeheartedly because she wanted to convey her own career, the country, and the people. A loyalty. I went to watch the film, and she asked me how it felt like. I stretched out four fingers to her, ""four words."" She asked me what it was. I said: ""Qin Yi quality"". Teacher Qin Yi left, and those who loved her could not send off for her.

It has been delivered a few days ago, but the hot pot base has been postponing the delivery time ... ""I believe many citizens have the same encounters and questions. In fact, the traditional express delivery of cross-cities has to be connected. The links passing through are relatively complicated. Generally, the following ""points"" must be passed: the shipper (place) -Sapile outlets-regional distribution center-another regional distribution center -The outlets-the consignee (place), as long as one of the links encounter ""intestinal obstruction"", your express mail cannot be delivered. ""Assuming that the personal buying things suddenly displayed from the outside world, it shows that the outlets near the receiving place started."" A person in the courier industry explained that the outlets near the recipient site only applied for resumption of work, ""three sections"", ""three sections"" It can be opened, which means that the outlets can be played out. However, as for whether it can be successfully delivered to the recipients, it is also necessary to see if the courier brother who is responsible for the delivery of the area has gone out of the seal -and -control community to return to the job. Sometimes it depends on whether the community can be received smoothly. Different expressners involve different shipping sites, different transportation courier companies, and different receiving communities. Even a express can involve multiple links. It will produce different situations such as ""some communities can receive express, some of the communities can not be collected"", ""this express company's express mail can be received, and the express of another courier company cannot be received."" After re -ordering or increasing the speed of the refunds to enter the mid -May, the pace of the postal express industry's resumption of labor and re -production has accelerated significantly. At present, some courier companies have previously accumulated backlogs in Shanghai, and they will gradually resume delivery, but the main capacity is still based on ensuring key supplies. For example, the backlog of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of pieces before the sealing control is basically complete. It will start delivery based on the social epidemic situation and outlets, courier resumptions from the regional social society, and provide services for the resumed merchants and institutions; Yuantong Tongtong Some outlets in Shanghai have re -production and re -production; Ji Rabbit's current resumption of work is mainly scattered, and the previous backlogs are delivered; Debon Air Transport Line goods have begun to resume the delivery business, the transfer yard has gradually recovered, and the scattered order has resumed. Delivery. For consumers, the home house is shopping to see the logistics information that you have bought, and it has also become a must -have ""homework"" every day.

As of now, it has issued more than 10,000 traffic permits for key supplies transportation vehicle traffic and internal epidemic prevention protection (material transportation). The second is to do a good job in epidemic prevention safety and take good care of people, cars, and mail express. Yu Hongwei said that the re -production of the postal express industry involves the chain long, due to the current epidemic situation, and the influence of multiple factors such as upstream platforms, trunk transportation, and ending outlets. The outlets mainly undertake the function of preserving the front warehouse, and the delivery of epidemic prevention materials, emergency medicines and daily necessities. Users, group users, and government users need the transportation needs, and these outlets are currently unable to provide individual users with receiving services. Yu Hongwei said that in the next step, it is necessary to restore the operation of the processing center and business outlets as much as possible, comprehensively restore personal delivery business as much as possible, and provide better services for citizens.

Space,"Looking for ""Spring""",Space,"For more than a month, I have been reading History for more than a month. Outside the window, the birds were stinging, the cherry blossoms were grateful, and Ying Shan was red open ... I muttered in my heart, this spring, I am afraid that I would pass by with me? That day, I carefully looked in the book on the bookshelf, the title of ""109 Spring"" attracted me, oh oh, my ""spring"", here! The book ""109 Spring"" is the autobiography of Ms. Yan Youyun. I bought it at the Shanghai Book Fair a few years ago. I turned over a few pages and did not read it carefully. This time, the home home has time to have time and can read it. Yan Youyun is a legendary woman. Her story is both inspirational and fun. For example, she is an old alumni of Fudan University. In 1927, Fudan opened women's ban on women and women. Yan Youyun was transferred to school from Hujiang University that year, and became the first girl of Fudan. Because he was born in a wealthy business family, Yan Youyun's family was rich. Her home lives in Jing'an Temple, and every day in Fudan, she takes a private car. Her license plate number is No. 84, English is Eighty Four, and Shanghai dialect reads ""love flowers"", so her nickname is ""flower of love"" -ly, she is the ""school flower"" of Fudan. At that time, there were very few people with private cars. As soon as Yan Youyun arrived at the school, it would arouse students' curiosity and onlookers. As a result, there were also many romantic affairs. Interestingly, Yan Youyun was born in the same month as Fudan in the same month. Born in September 1905 (founded in September 1905), she died in 2017 and lived 112 years old. She heard that the old China and New China yesterday and the New China were performers and witnesses of the century -old China. Her life has both hardship and suffering, and happiness and sweetness. Her two husbands are well -known Chinese diplomats. The first is Yang Guangzheng, the Consul General of China in the Philippines. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Yang Guangzheng was secretly killed by the Japanese army in the Philippines. The second place was the refusal agreement at the Paris and the meeting in Paris in 1919. In 1945, China signed the ""UN Charter"" on behalf of China to serve Gu Weijun for decades for Chinese diplomacy. The characters and stories of the Yan Youyun family are intertwined with the historical history of China. She wrote in the ""Foreword"" of this book, ""... I hope young people can like this book. They can learn about China a hundred years ago, and I bravely adapt to the story of the new century."" Nine Spring """", revealing several historical inside story and twists and turns, which is a autobiography with strong readability, pictures and texts. I was impressed by me, and there was a line of words printed on the title page: ""Every day is a good day."" This is what Yan Youyun said in the English version of the 105 -year -old in the English version of ""Readers"". Its original text is: ""I am very satisfied with my life, healthy body, happiness, when people ask me,"" How are you today? ""I always answer"" Every day is a good day '. "" I admire this sentence very much. I think this is probably one of the reasons for Yan Youyun's longevity. Today, the COVID-19 epidemic is raging and closed at home. We will inevitably have helplessness and grievances. However, as long as we study carefully, we can have a mentality like Yan Youyun, so that spring flowers are opened in our hearts-the book ""Spring ""There will be"" spring ""in my heart.

Space,Qing Ru Shui White Description,Space,"During the epidemic of Li Dawei, he was held at home for two months. He stood himself and slowly slowed down and calmed down. Boring moment, the best pastime: reading. After reading a stack of books, Xiaoyi Yiying couldn't help but want to spray. Let's talk about Hu Shi's ""Forty Self -Read"". Forty years ago, I read it, read a paragraph, satisfied curiosity, and only obtained the impression of bone. Forty years later, read, read in one word, peeping at cell text. The text is brick, which is built into a wall. The text is wonderful, and the article is decided, especially prose. The first time I discovered: Hu Shi's vernacular text is so pure, like a girl's black hair, without a trace of ancient white hair. This book is very thin. If you appreciate the text, the best one is the first chapter. The most moving part is the young mother. Hu Shi's mother is 33 years old than Hu Shi's father, seven years younger than Hu Shi's eldest sister, and two years younger than the elder brother. Hiromato, her status is very embarrassing. Six years after marriage, her husband died, leaving her will: Mi (Hu Shi's nickname) was very smart and should make him read. At that time, the mother was only 23 years old. This period of pavement is simple structure and clear. Below is Hu Shi's original text: ""When I was eleven years old, my second brother and third brother were at home. One day my mother said to them,"" I am eleven years old. You Lao Tzu calls him to study. ? ""The third brother sneered:‘ Hum, read. ’The second brother never said anything. My mother endured it for a while, and she dared to cry when she returned to the room. She dared not offend them, because the family's finances were all in the hands of the second brother. So she could only cry and dare not cry. ""You Lao Tzu"": One of you highlights the distance between them, because they are not born to her, but the son of her husband. ""My mother"": One me shows that he and his brothers are different. Mother, can't help but call ""my mother"". ""Dare not cry"": The Hui faction buildings in southern Anhui are all wooden board walls, and the sound insulation is poor, so I dare not cry. Deep, tingling and tingling. Hu Shi's white paintings only have narratives, without the calmness, no judgment, no explanation, the attitude comes out, the dark psychology also jumps out, the face of the characters present is vivid, so that the reader is close to it. Realm. Hu Shi's vernacular skills printed with water in the water. There is no dried dried vegetables in the old books of private books. Such a compliment: ""Pure vernacular of clear water. ""Hu Shi's biggest contribution, the first new cultural movement of"" vernacular "", his own pen and ink are the format. Hu Shi also has a memoir, Hu Shi orally, Tang Degang's English record,"" Hu Shi Zhi Zhuan "", which is Ying Columbia University"" The covenant of the Chinese Ministry of History ""is for English readers. At that time, Tang Degang was studying for a PhD in history at Brother University. Twenty years later, Tang Degang was translated according to English, thinking of a smooth way:"" Snow in the sky does not rain, snow comes to the ground to the ground It turns into rain, it is more troublesome to become rain, it is better to rain at the beginning. ""The exit is transferred to domestic sales, and the circle is quite large, but this Chinese memoir, in terms of text, is born in English, which is equivalent to second -hand goods. The characteristics of Hu Clan. The novel is attracted by the plot, so the translation does not affect the reading experience. With the text of the text that built the wall of the text, the translation is a chewed ravioli, the original taste is gone. It is much better than the Chinese book of this second -hand goods. It shows the Tang style: from time to time in vernacular, there are one or two ancient texts, such as writing Hu Shi to participate in a doctoral interview at Columbia University in 1917. The title is Chinese philosophy. His six foreign professors have only one who understands Chinese, but he cannot read the original classical works. Tang Degang couldn't help but laugh at: ""The six campaign of his test"", the image is straightforward and has no flavor. The sea wide sky, the knowledge of the stomach is unable to hold it. The annotation of a small problem is an article that wrote a preface to ""The Autobiography of Hu Shiba"". Please write this preface to a ""bullish"" Donald Duck! (Blog: The top meaning of the Shanghai language. In the Shanghai and Northern and Northern people dialogue: ""Pull a hook? My mother. Good body? Scream!). With a travel bag, I get off the car without getting on the car. "" Listening to Shandong's fast book, first of all, the opening remarks, so gimmicky! One cannon is to be regarded as a skill! Read the big mouth of the Tang Dynasty articles, and the floral porcelain is trivial. Hu Shi's article is steamed broadband fish, and Tang Desang is a braised head and tail. From time to time, a few drops of ancient texts are dripped. Taste! Reading ""The Autobiography of Hu Shi"", be sure to read Tang's notes. The bridesmaids look better than brides! To appreciate Hu Shi's vernacular view, there is no refreshing appearance of the stone under the stream. Let's look at the current text: stupid white and verbure, because there is no ancient text, the skeleton is scattered. There are two streams in the current superior prose: one text, Liang Shiqiu's ""Ya Shi Betsu"" published on the eve of the founding of New China.

In addition to the main living materials, people were embarrassed, belonging to non -essential products, cakes that increased their burdens to volunteers, cola, fried chicken, and homemade bread, and so on. When a wave of non -essentials was sent to a wave of buyers, the joyful breath on the mobile phone was completely virtual party scale. In the dilemma, a little good situation changes, stimulating people's sense of humor and happiness. All kinds of small hobbies were respected and praised. ""Hezhi frost, my roses."" After the basic needs are realized, roses also bloom. The 52 -pack brand of hanging ear -hanging coffee is lined up in the living room like a row of beautiful bullets. The dining photos in the Qunqun, with the increasingly richer group purchase, have a good soup on the table, and a meal of five or six dishes, all of which have the atmosphere of the New Year. The information issued continuously by the five or six group purchase groups is also very good for a day. The quarrel, reconciliation, complaint, gratitude, casual screen, all vitality. Some people told the owner to eat edamame, and some told him that the picture was broad beans. ""Who bought broad beans? I really want to eat."" ""Auntie, do you want? I don't eat beans, I have been purchased in the refrigerator for two days. I will send you, don't want money, take it. Don't tangle. I put it at the door! """" Can't stop the temptation. Love you. There is something like a small thing at the door! Thank you for solving the feelings of our husband and wife. "" The meat, the knife is not good, who has the knife stone?

Maybe the old lady knew that I had retired, and she asked me to recommend it to be the leader of the building, and she could only be ashamed to return to her: because she hadn't had a vaccine needle, even volunteers could not be regarded! The old lady continued her hard work. And ""What can I do?"" Of course it bothered me. ""Mi, I don't want it."" When I said that, I felt very arrogant. Sometimes don't speak better than sound.

""There is no name for the settlement office, only a little girl looks like a little girl. When I saw this letter, my heart was melted. I imagined that the child was standing in front of the window and facing the sky to ""send a letter"". I imagined that she was standing behind her love her, understanding her, and understanding her. The elder who accompanies her, is not anxious, irritable, not annoyed, no one step faster than the child, no one step slower than the child, looking out of the window with the child, the paper plane slowly scratched the sky, gently falls softly on the street A corner. For the little girl, ""Omikon"" is no longer important, because no matter how much trouble it brings, it is only a long dog floating cloud in a long life; and the willingness to accompany her to write a letter to write a letter The elders who sent the letter are the ""Sun Moonlight and Fudan"" in her life -it can give her the warmth and guidance of her life length. Not every elder can be so calm. In the days of home, adults have the pressure of adults. Under stress, everyone may have a stress response, such as irritability, such as indifference, such as completely lost patience to children -especially when there is more than one child in the house, no matter how big the room is, they can not support their vigorous energy and endless noise. hour. But many elders want to be calm. Some parents often said in the ""Shanghai"" hotline in Lin Zi's psychological psychology: ""Every time they finish the fire, they will regret it. In fact, it was a bit more patient at the time ..."" Or: ""I also know that villains need to be accompanied, but adults have some people. There are so many things to be busy, annoying and annoying, where are you leisurely? ""In fact, no matter whether or not or not,"" patience and idleness ""are luxury things in this era, because the value of the adult world has been paid by"" ""It is useful"" and ""busy"" to define.

They are expected to keep up with the pace of adults as soon as possible, do not ""chaos"" -Although they have been affected by changes in the rhythm of life in the days of home pressure. However, for young children, even if they cannot explain what they are happening in words, their emotional experience is the same real and profound. And the emotional memory formed by such experience is the key to determining whether the child is happy in life. When the elders realize this, they will find that the more patience and leisure they use the more treasures -the more willing to accompany the children, the more they can get the most true power from the child; the more powerful Patience in parent -child relationship, because no longer needs to find self -worth from continuous busyness; the more patient, the more ""leisure"" to play the greatest imagination. The imagination is not only restricted by home or not, but also extend the parent -child relationship from the square inch to the moon ...

Space,"In the early morning, the night guard in front of Shikumen",Space,"The middle road lights of Yan'an in the midnight are still lit, reflecting the empty and tranquility of the night. A simple pavilion on the side of the road is eye -catching. The waterproof cloth of the pavilion is along a row of words printed with A4 paper -Kenan Temporary Police Station, which looks a bit messy under the erosion of wind and rain. A police motorcycle, four ""big white"" seemed particularly eye -catching in front of a row of dark Shimen database. The direct association is that they are in the dream of guarding Shikumen. It was 0:00 on the 15th at this time. After being ordered to check the identity, the two policemen accepted the interview. Feng Juwei and Yang Jingcheng, the pair of policemen ""master and apprentices"" have been on duty for 28 days in this area. The Shengping residential area west of Shimen, the Zhongkai residential area east, and both sides of Maoming North Road are their positions. In this area, the outbreak was rapid in mid -April, and hundreds of positive cases were successively detected. At the same time, two neighborhood committees in charge of this area were spared only one person, and one ""Yang"" was half. The two masters and apprentices were ""airdrop"" here, and the relay ""fluttered"". Feng Juwei introduced that there was a serious epidemic here, which was closely related to the living environment of the residents in Shikumen. Most of the residents of these old houses are still used in coal and guards. Some people in Shengping's residential area are even using toilets, resulting in the rapid spread of the virus. Transfer, elimination, nucleic acid and antigen detection, supplies of supplies and medical treatment of materials ... Feng Juwei and Yang Jingcheng, ""leadership"" two young volunteers of Li Caiyun and Zhang Lidi, cooperated with the remaining staff of the neighborhood committee to do their best to extinguish the epidemic and guard the virus in the virus People who are particularly fragile in front of them. In 28 days, the two masters and apprentices ate and lived in a office in Shengping Shikumen. Sleeping floor, eating box lunch, water heater broken, you can only take a cold bath. One day when the online meeting was opened, Feng Juwei had been coughing. The leader asked worriedly: ""Are you a recruitment?"" In fact, he didn't drink water all day. Regardless of the transshipment in the middle of the night or the nucleic acid detection in the early morning, you can see the figures of Feng Juwei and Yang Jingcheng. There was a woman who had refused to do nucleic acid testing in the Zhong Kenan community. Only Yang Jingcheng called to ""invite"" her and stood on the scene to ""supervise"". She was willing to come down. Yang Jingcheng said that as long as she is willing to do nucleic acid testing, this is a trivial matter. Looking at the two women standing in the dawn railing. Although wearing a protective suit, a mask and a mask, you can still feel youthfulness. The two volunteers of Li Caiyun and Zhang Lixian are the night guards of the old house of Zhong Kainan. After 0, one of them can sleep slightly for two or three hours. At 6:30 in the morning, they will both appear in their posts. Licai Yun was born in 1994. Before the epidemic, he was a salesperson of the Qipu Road wholesale market, and his hometown was Wuhu, Anhui. Zhang Liqian, born in 1998, his hometown is Nanchang, Jiangxi, his previous work was a customer service of a Tmall merchant. After the company suspended its business, they all chose to be volunteers. ""It's also idle and want to do something meaningful."" Li Caiyun and Zhang Lian were sent here on March 30 and April 10, respectively, and this may also be their hardest life experience so far. Falling off every day at noon, they only sleep for 3-5 hours a day. The ""bedroom"" is an abandoned nucleic acid detection tent on the roadside, and ""Xi Mengsi"" is a few cardboard picked up. They sleep in protective clothes every day and take off the mask. Nevertheless, wake up the forehead and the eyelids in the morning with a mosquito bag. The most ""tragedy"" was that on the evening of April 23, Zhang Liqian woke up and found that he was sleeping in ""water"", and his clothes, quilts, and cardboard were wet. That night, the two did not sleep overnight, watching the sky slowly lit up. I love Shanghai to check the ""riding"" electronic pass, arrange foreign items to eliminate and disinfect, settlement, and organize supply of supplies to transport materials, transfer, nucleic acid testing ... Every day Feng Juwei and Yang Jingcheng have endless things. Due to the special circumstances of the old district of the street, residents often go out to ""walk"" and even walk the dogs to persuade them to do what they do every day. Li Yuhong and Zhang Liqian, transported express, each time the nucleic acid and antigen detection do auxiliary work, persuade the residents, and check the entry and exit ... every day is not allowed. With the advantages of customer service, Zhang Lixi patiently convinced the elderly here to pay attention to protective details, and the effect was obvious. No matter how hard, as long as the residents say ""Bai Bai, thank you"", they feel warm in their hearts, everything is worth it. The two girls said that they were volunteers, both ""cut first and then play"". Although the parents are worried, they are still very supportive. The most thing is to want them to pay attention to safety. Both said that when they were volunteers, I never thought of whether there was any remuneration, but I just felt that someone had to stand up at this time to do something for the city. Li Caiyun said she liked the ""passion"" of Shanghai, and Zhang Lixi said she liked Shanghai's ""fast pace"". Feng Juwei said that since May 12th, this area has not been ""yang"" for three days. There are no transfer tasks in the past two days, the frequency of nucleic acid detection has also decreased, and the work seems to be ""idle"". He was happy for this, not because the work was relatively easy, but because the old community finally returned to peace and peace after experiencing storms.

Space,Girl and Master,Space,"Shen Jialu once watched a celebrity interview show on TV. A world -renowned golf star recalled that when he was four years old, he was taken to the green field by his father to watch the game. Children don't understand the rules of the game, but they can really feel that aura. A large group of people follow the stars. Where he goes, applause, laughter, and cheers follow.

The granddaughter's school is the second primary school of Penglai Road with a century -old history. The school attaches great importance to quality education. The atmosphere created inside and outside the class has always encouraged students to explain the book, use hand, brain, and innovative thinking. The ""green homework"" arranged by the teacher is the most popular. One piece of A4 paper, a theme, a set of keywords or patterns, and the rest are given to the students to play freely. Focusing on the ""green homework"" of the granddaughter, it is often unwilling to get rid of dinner. There is a ""Penglai Town"" in the school that is designed to enrich the spare -school activities. There are various interest classes outside the outdoor activities, such as environmental protection, magic, color mud, small vegetable fields, post and telecommunications bureau, flight attendants, western restaurants, etc. On the day of interested class, the children ran out of the school gate like a group of chickens after school, and they were particularly happy. The school also encourages students to write books and organize publishing! Affected by the family environment, the granddaughter is more interested in the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" in the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" than the granddaughter, the idioms, and historical figures. In the second grade, the principal and teacher were encouraged to sign up to participate in the writing team. At the beginning, she also wanted to write science fiction or cross, and I suggested that she pay attention to the actual theme. The little girl blinked and blinked: ""Let me write a travel notes?""

During the interview, I recorded a recording for her and took a photo. After sorting the recording into an article, you must drag for a few days, and then get a draft on the weekend. After I modify and adjust it, it is copied on the composition book. Girls are always ""doing"", not to mention that in our house, we must first have a sense of ritual, and write it half before applying some wind oil to the head. The back itching and scratching her; the nails were long, and she was cut for her; the nib is thick and gave her; thirsty, quickly poured water; the stomach was hungry, the pastry was served; the mosquito harassed, and the siege of the siege; Sugar is here! Sometimes she also said: Grandpa, you go to a while. As soon as the eyelids were put together, I heard a shout: Grandpa, what is the ""cable"" of the cable? Sometimes she wrote tears: ""The teacher arranged the composition of three hundred words. You see that I have four pieces of paper, and the brain will explode!"" Tell her to rest for a while and refuse to.

Zhu Xinzheng is in line -what you know about this person, you can't hold anything, you have to talk about it. He said to the ""big white"" that maintains order: This queuing test is a crowd gathering, and there will be risks. The staff member looked at him, speechless. Bao Sui on the side gently pulled Zhu Xinzhang: Don't talk more. It is not easy for everyone. Or, let's consider to be volunteers? Do something for each other. The couple will smile. I know them 50 years ago. Eyes blinked. In 1973, when I graduated from middle school, I entered the Twelfth Cotton Textile Factory Technical School. Zhu Xinzheng is already the deputy secretary of the Youth League Committee of this 7,000 -People's Congress factory. Bao Sui is a cadre of the fine yarn workshop. Later, the secretary of the workshop group and the secretary of the party branch. In recent years, because of some of my factory writing, the characters and stories of the factory have been heard in the past, so they hear the ""war"" experience of those ordinary people during the epidemic -the next day, the couple of Zhu Xinzhang and Bao Sui found the community neighborhood committee. Sign up to be volunteers: ""We are all Communist Party members."" But when the couple showed their identity card registration, the cadres of the neighborhood committee informed that there was no acceptance that it was not acceptable at the age of 70. ""You go home and keep your body more."" The two were over 70 years old, and the appearance really couldn't see it. Inside, there was a sincere heart -we do something that we can do. Bao Sui said that the two of them prepared 84 disinfection potions and sprayed and eliminated the corridor and elevators of the building every day. The tenant of the door is the three younger sisters who work. They will not disinfect them. They are responsible for providing their own disinfection potions. During the epidemic, Bao Suhong will make preserved egg lean porridge, with fish porridge, eight treasure hot sauce, pickled white radish, hot and sour kimchi; the fragrant lettuce leaves that usually throw them are used to cook rice and meal. I really have to save. ""I always save a little, so in case people need to help, we can get some urgent emergency. We have done mass work in the factory in the past. You know what everyone should look like at this time. We too. If you ca n’t do anything big, do something he can do. ""Hou Yewei will live. During the epidemic, he led the supplies for residents in the community and calculates the economic account for the residents of the community. The supplies are scarce, and the group purchase of the group is a bit expensive. She is determined to buy cheap vegetables online for the residents of the community; the mission must be reached. Look at her bill -10 yuan 3 pounds of small peas, 15 yuan 3 pounds of snails, 7 yuan per catty of eggplant, other such as watermelon, which is almost cheap as the market. The gatekeeper of the community, sealing for a month, sleeping in the property office at night, no bed. On the sixth day, Hou Yewei discovered that this information was taken to the Volunteer WeChat group and received attention, and the property manager sent the marching bed. That day, the security guard said to Hou Yewei -I finally got off my clothes and slept well today. What is even more moving is that the security guard has no clothes to change, and Hou Yewei brings his new underwear and socks. Women who have worked as a textile factory are enthusiastic and thoughtful, and they know how to eat warmth; men have to eat -Hou Yewei often gives security guards to send tiger egg saffron meat, crayfish, Starbucks coffee. Speaking of group purchase, former group cadre, and later served as the deputy factory director Song Huizhen, there are also stories. She said that as soon as she entered the community shopping group, she was asked to use the building number of the building to make her own WeChat name. She made a long time on the mobile phone and added a bunch of Arabic numerals after the WeChat name -the building number and the floor Number. In the evening, the daughter couldn't understand, and asked, ""How do you add a string of numbers on the WeChat name after the WeChat name, weird."" She said that it was required to fill in the group purchase request. The daughter laughed and taught her to pull off the ""chat information"" column in the shopping group to ""My nickname in the group"", and the floor number of the upstairs building was available. The shopping list came out, and Song Huizhen saw many friends who dragged a series of Arabic numerals behind. Similar to her. Supremely electricity, correction. It can also be considered a skill to use a mobile phone. Bai Huiqun is a classmate of our technical school and has also been a group cadre. What she said, I think it is more flavorful -she lives in the bottom floor, with a small courtyard, planting bamboo next door, and the spring bamboo shoots rush to her courtyard through the courtyard wall. Neighborhoods -you might as well dig bamboo shoots, make food, try to try. It is also urgent. After the old saying: ""It is better to eat without meat, do not live without bamboo."" I deliberately confirmed with Bai Huiqun -you really eat food? Answer, pickled fresh and oil bamboo shoots. Bai Huiqun's emotion -maybe I can never eat that taste and deliciousness in the future. The working class of this city was once the first generation of industrial workers in China. Most of the tribes at the bottom of the country are tightened. When the city was in crisis, they came forward and tightened their screws at the highest level of the city at the highest level of the city, reaching the hearts of people.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-16/8.htm,5/16/22,8th Edition: Nights Cup,

"The situation of resistance is getting better, and positive signals are constantly being released. New news from Lingang continued to come from Hong Kong","traffic jams, but I have never been so happy",Space,"Our reporter Yang Huan drove from the urban area to Lingang, and the traffic gradually increased. There are also traffic jams at the S2 high -speed intersection at Lianggang Avenue, and the cards and heavy truck queue to verify the electronic pass and nucleic acid code. This makes the reporter very excited, because the city is recovering, and the vitality is back. The city pressed the ""suspension key"" due to the epidemic, and countless people fought against the virus. At present, the situation is improving, and the positive signals of continuous release make people believe that the long -awaited life recovery is just as usual. In the middle of last month, the two news from Lingang attracted much attention. On April 18, SAIC Group officially launched a re -production and re -production pressure test. On April 19, 8,000 employees from the Shanghai Shanghai plant returned. The leading enterprises in these two automotive fields are of great significance. According to Wu Jinsheng, director of the Shanghai Economic Information Commission, the key industry chain in Shanghai is in an orderly manner. For example There are about 2,000 vehicles on the line every day, driving more than 1,100 component supporting enterprises upstream and downstream to restore production. These data made reporters happy, and I also decided to go to the Hong Kong to see the situation of the company's resumption of labor and production. At present, the staff of the Lingang Management Committee are divided into two batches for 24 hours. The people in the internal field are in closed -loop management and are responsible for online approval, coordination, decision -making, etc., and they are in the office. The deputy director of several major departments such as High Science and Technology, Creation of diplomatic relations, and comprehensive insurance in the field led the ""soldiers"" to supervise and coordinate on -site to help enterprises resume work and production. The reporter contacted Li Xiangcong, the person in charge of the High -tech Industry and Science and Technology Innovation Office of the Lingang Management Committee. The original interview time was 13:30, but he was always busy. He opened an online meeting with the internal staff to talk about the problems encountered in the promotion of the investment promotion project and prepare to pull the relevant departments to coordinate together. Waiting for the gap, the reporter surrounds the surroundings. A young man sat on the floor, holding the computer to sort the data, and the quilt was scattered on the sofa behind him. Obviously, during this time, he was sleeping sofa. The young man named Wang Bin, a senior student graduated from Zhejiang University. He was born in 1995. He was just selected to Lingang in January this year. At the beginning, the management committee ranked class, preparing for Class A for a week, and then changed class B. As a result, class B was missing one person. Wang Bin, who finished Class A, took the initiative to ask him to stay. As soon as he stayed, he stayed until now. In the committee, there are many young people who are willing to endure hardships and dare to take responsibility. Everyone is very busy, the reporter can only interview with a stitched needle, from 1 pm to 9 pm. Someone had a box of hot soup before entering the group. After eating for more than a month, there was the last pack. Use boiling water to exchange it, and with the cold box lunch, it is a welcome banquet. Hu spicy soup tasted, sour, salty, and spicy, but after eating, the tongue returned to sweet, and the experience of these anti -epidemic personnel just corresponds to one of them. Sour — Back pain and sleeping miscellaneous objects, put the cabinet as a busy afternoon, Li Xiangcong did not leave his seat. During dinner, I kept pressed and neck, and the old faults were committed again. In the previous on -duty, everyone went to the office to sleep in the military bed. When his spine was not good, he ran into the debris alone and put the cabinet down as a hard board bed. After arriving in the field, there was a bed, but everyone had no time to rest. Sometimes, she took a car to the park and narrowed for ten minutes. At present, 17 people in the Gaoke Department are responsible for managing the resident and returning personnel of the Hong Kong enterprises. With the advancement of re -production and re -production, the number of people is changing every day. They want to organize enterprises to do nucleic acid detection, send antigen, send materials, and sort out accounts for statistics, and solve the ""urgency and sorrow"" of employees, such as medical treatment and medicine. In terms of re -production and re -production, the enterprise first submitted the application, the management committee was approved in the internal field, and the outside field was guaranteed and coordinated. In the resumption of work, the setting of the silent area, on -site disinfecting, and preparation of epidemic prevention materials must be written clearly. The High Science and Technology Department will ""fly inspection"", find problems, and urge rectification. Ma -the task heavier engineering male epidemic prevention, the method is very ""hard -core"" enterprises scattered in different areas, and it is not difficult to manage. The 17 people at the Gaoke Department were divided into 9 groups, each with division of labor. The division is accurate, and it cannot be simply scored according to the area of the park, because there are so few corporate employees. Where is the nucleic acid dot setting, how to arrange the order, and what lines to take, it must be ""optimal solution"". The Hi -Tech Department is basically engineering students, and the logical thinking is relatively strong. When engaged in investment, they painted the industrial map. This time, experience also used the epidemic prevention and control. A young man named Wang Zhiyang was borrowed from the company. During the epidemic prevention, he made a lot of ""strategy maps"". He distributed the nucleic acid detection point, and the vehicle running line, who is responsible for each block, draws clearly. ""At the beginning, we met for a meeting overnight and discussed how to get the account. Now that the mechanism is rational, the complicated work has a clue."" Wang Zhiyang said that the ledger was to organize data for statistics. This is a complicated work. For example, the Tesla Shanghai factory 8,000 employees returned to work and scattered around. The High Science Department will issue a certificate, open a certificate and sort out the list. When statistics, name, address, mobile phone number, nucleic acid code, license plate number, etc. must be recorded. Salty -sweaty and tears moving with materials, the goddess becomes ""man"" every day, but young people are good at ""self -deprecating"" and make fun. Wang Zhiyang has a ""black photo"" of many friends on mobile phones. There are photos very eye -catching. A thin girl moved heavy materials, her face raised her blue tendons, her hair scattered with a scattered braid, and ""female man"" was full of anger. Her name is Liu Tong, a ""post -90s"" girl, and she speaks very gentle. Liu Tong reported to the management committee in March and followed the field to participate in the epidemic prevention and control. I did everything together, and I did n’t call for 1,000 boxes of materials. As a result, at a nucleic acid testing site, she cried. Everyone sleeps very late every day, and we have to wait for the specific notice of nucleic acid. I will go to the scene early the next day. Once, Liu Tong was maintaining order and guiding everyone to maintain a distance. Some workers did not wear a mask, and she stepped forward to discourage, and the other party pulled the mask down. Liu Tong burst into tears and burst into tears, silently holding the watering pot for disinfection, and then continued to communicate. ""You are almost the same as my parents, and there are children working outside. Do not want them to be wronged. Everyone has difficulty, but still needs to understand each other."" In some words, the progress of the progress was smooth. Sweet -unforgettable recalls we love her, hoping that she is getting better and better. Shang, if scattered in various places, the progress is not so fast. It is more convenient to gather in the port. ""As one of the service specialists of the Tesla Shanghai Super Factory, the three sentences of the Hi -Tech Office are inseparable from the business. At the end of the interview, I did not forget to ""advertise"" the new area of Lingang. This time will also be the unforgettable memories of everyone. Of the 17 people outside the Gaoke Department, Liu Tong was from Gansu, Liu Xianzhe was from Liaoning, Wang Haipeng was from Shandong, Wang Zhiyang and Li Xiangcong were from Henan, Liu Guoshun was from Guangxi, Shen Jiaming, Ni Cenzen, Zhang Xuqing and Cao Yang were from Jiangsu. Wang Xiao, Wang Bin, Jiang Dongxin, Zhou Zhou, Lu Hao and Xun Tao are from Shanghai. In order to participate in the construction of a new area, they became ""Hong Kong people"". ""Because I love this city deeply, I hope she will get better and better."" As of May 16, 477 industrial enterprises in the newly re -production and re -production industry of Lingang New Area. Among them, 301 industrial enterprises were regulated, accounting for 95.6%of the total enterprise volume. The total number of 477 companies returned and residents exceeded 50,000. At present, nearly 20 companies such as SAIC -Gang Hong Kong Passenger Vehicle Factory, Tesla Shanghai Factory, nearly 20 companies including Xin Sheng, Jijita, Sanyi, Shanghai Electric, Hangfa Fa, and Shanghai Flight Manufacturing have also realized closed production or research and development; Eight major projects such as grid and rewinding have been resumed.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/3.htm,5/17/22,,
Space,"Many foreign companies in the ""Shanghai"" say confidence",Space,"For many financial practitioners who work at Lujiazui, in April, the epidemic was fierce, but the ""heart"" of China Finance jumped smoothly. Shanghai is one of the most gathering cities in my country's financial element market. Since this round of epidemic, the major financial factors markets have arranged on -site office office by strengthening data backup and security management, ensuring that the transaction is not interrupted. The financial regulatory authorities have also opened for 24 hours to ensure that the major financial factors markets are running smoothly. The basic functions of the whole weather have not discounted for nearly two months, and many people's lives have been pressed for the suspension key, but the financial factors markets, including securities, futures, and foreign exchange, are open normally. Under the epidemic, ""Shanghai price"" continues to be output.

In order to ensure the smooth and safe operation of the trading business, the Shanghai Stock Exchange implements closed -loop management of the core personnel of the transaction business operation. And enable remote office and other measures. In addition, the Shanghai Stock Exchange also prepared a core transaction spare team of 50 people to work in Takahashi Outer Takahashi; reserved a 10 -person ""fire"" team among the office staff to deal with possible extreme sudden situations. In the Shanghai Futures Exchange not far away, the busy transaction is also not inferior to the past. The relevant person in charge of the Shanghai Futures Exchange Trading Department said that since the epidemic, one of the previous period was to pledge business, futures stability orders, and free collection fees through the standard warehouse receipt platform to help enterprises relieve difficulties and resolve difficulties; second It is a coordination of warehouses, tax authorities, member companies and other parties to ensure the smooth progress of the delivery related work; the third is to fully support the technical operation and maintenance of member units.

They obtained 798 million yuan in bank loans and average interest rates of loans was about 4%. To terms of extent, the company's capital pressure was eased; the ""futures stable price order"" tool continued to play. Six production and processing companies have ordered 75,500 tons of hot -rolled coils through this business, and their procurement costs have also been covered with capacity. Financial ""back -supporting groups"" help enterprises to relieve difficulties and solve difficulties. In order to help enterprises resume work and re -production, financial institutions also serve as powerful ""rear aid groups."" At present, the Shanghai Banking Regulatory Bureau monitors the bank insurance institutions' credit investment, seamless renewal and other businesses, and at the same time, timely monitor the flow of more than 4 million corporate bank accounts, pay in and out of wages, and to capture the epidemic and enterprises The impact on both ends provides a basis for re -production and re -production decisions. Many banks and insurance companies in Shanghai have also introduced a number of relief measures such as ""stable chain insurance"". Insurance companies are also ""transfusion"" in time. Although the epidemic has added difficulties to exports, the transaction continues, and overseas markets cannot give up. China Credit Insurance Shanghai Branch has the policy responsibilities of guaranteeing orders for enterprises and stable exports. On the one hand, the company increases risk tolerance, increases limited support, helps enterprises enhance their confidence in transaction, ensure stability of overseas markets; on the other hand, increase underwriting support before exports, improve the efficiency of approval, improve the effectiveness of underwriting support, and meet market demand. Since the epidemic control in March, the support enterprise in Shanghai has obtained nearly 2,400 new approvals, with a total amount of more than 2.8 billion US dollars, an increase of 48%over the same period last year. It is far ahead of the average level of the entire system. There are also some financial people's outbreaks during the period of work. Opportunities to boost the confidence of international institutional investors. International investors are firmly optimistic about the future of Shanghai, in fact, international institutional investors have not been shaken by Shanghai.

Space,One point for residents can not earn it,"""Three Money"" Party Member Volunteer Service Team Leading Jin Tao leads everyone to insist on cheap supply","There are 30 brands of eggs in the one -board egg industry. They have been selling 27 to 30 yuan for ordinary people's group buying because they are too cheap to be complained. When the logistics is not good and the supplies are scarce, how does such a temporary patch together have always insisted that the factory price does not add a penny, volunteers do not handle a penny, and the team does not seek a penny for self -interest? Yesterday, Jin Tao, the ""three -penny"" party volunteer service team, told the story to the reporter. As a party member and cadre of the municipal organs, Jin Tao's job is to connect with rural party building. In the early days of Puxi Sealing, friends asked him for help, saying that there were no supplies in the community. So he helped contact 400 packs of rice. After the first order was made, one passed on the ten and ten passed by, and others came to ask for help after knowing that he had an affordable channel. For more than two days, it provided more than 2,000 packs of rice. Because he can only sleep for 1 hour a day, he feels that he is physically weak. Material remuneration and spiritual rewards are not as divided into position levels. ""As soon as the news was sent out, many people signed up, and they formed a 21 -member party volunteer service team. Everyone has transformed into a ""small two"" who sells vegetables, sell melons, sell rice, sell eggs, sell meat, and sell soy sauce on online low -priced dishes. For example, Min Nan from Shanghai Jiaotong University, in order to do a good job in practicing farming services, transformed into agricultural experts almost overnight. Xu Yuewen, from Shanghai Aerospace Electrical and Electrical, is a vegetable under the Golden Mountain Corridor. Every day, what green leaf vegetables eat on the table for the citizens will be twisted with their brains ... The price does not increase a penny, volunteers do not have a penny, and the team does not seek a penny for personal gain. Countless times, for a broken egg, a piece of crushed vegetable leaves, a packet of flat tomatoes, a bunch of black spots with black spots, an unpleasant apple, a bottle of broken soy sauce, in order to seal They controlled the dinner of residents of the community, and they broke their hearts. They also have to talk to the guarantee manufacturer: ""Now is a very period of the epidemic, we must not only consider economic interests, and we must talk about social responsibility. We do not make a penny, and I hope you can help solve logistics and give residents aquatic high -quality materials. ""They also had to talk to the head of the regiment:"" You have to get such a good thing. The only requirement is not to add a penny. The supplies can be sent to the residents within an hour. "" There are difficulties in distribution of materials and no one. Jin Tao asked them to go to the secretary of the residential district to mobilize party members to do it together. Fresh eggs of 0.9-1 yuan/piece, 1.25 yuan/bag plus iodized salt, 2 yuan/jin of lettuce, 2.2 yuan/Baokang master ... Slowly, the word of mouth of this team has also been sold, and so far, it has been sold. 1,000 tons of living materials. Because of their quality and low price, they were also reported maliciously, saying they disrupted market order. In the team, because of the comrades of the Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, they are not afraid of malicious reports. Thanksgiving and love partners are gradually supporting, and there will be love companies to come to the door and want to donate supplies. ""They don't know that we have no warehouses or transportation. They are all groups of online volunteers, but we still push down with scalp. As long as they are supplied by the materials that people support Shanghai, we must try their best to receive it."" Jin Tao said. What moved him most was the caring entrepreneur named Xu Kai. On April 19, Xu Kai contacted him and said that he would donate 350 pigs to Shanghai. He asked: ""You need to go through a lot of procedures. What if you can't do this?"" What should I do? """" I started killing pigs tonight, you must do it! ""Xu Kai replied. That night, Xu Kai sent two large trucks from Yunnan to ship out 700 pork pigs. Several drivers took turns to drive in two days and two nights. They drove to Shanghai early on the 22nd and sent them to the first -tier anti -epidemic units in 5 districts. They were busy until the early morning of the next day. ""I called them and said thank you, donated hundreds of thousands of things, and didn't even see it."" Jin Tao said that Xu Kai, who lives in Shanghai, because of the coordination of pigs out of the community and finished finishing. After the formalities, I couldn't return again. I could only stay in the car for two days first, and then helped him find a hotel to stay. The bills of the Charity Foundation in each district can be used to deduct taxes, but Xu Kai doesn't care.

General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee provides a guide for action and injecting a action guide for winning the Big Shanghai Defense War. Powerful power. The city has always been firm in confidence and walks in the same direction. Everyone is a combatant. Our war ""epidemic"" is a people's war. Only everyone responds, everyone's participation, and self -discipline of everyone can win the ultimate victory. Many citizens can do ""epidemic"" to ""supervisors"" to find problems, volunteers who have served, and the mutual assistants who have helped each other to actively build good words and good strategies for the prevention and control of the Shanghai epidemic. He is a young post -95 grass -roots cadre. He has not returned home for more than four months. He seamlessly connects the street from the airport volunteer, and he is looking forward to the consciousness of the people around him as the consciousness of the proposal. He is a foreign -enterprise employee who takes the initiative to sign up as a community volunteer. While enthusiastically serving the masses, he observes carefully and carefully, and provides suggestions for the work of grassroots epidemic prevention. She is an old man with a white hair. Although the mobile phone is not skilled, she always pays attention to the needs of the elderly and actively speaks for the elderly. They are a group of enthusiastic proposals. They have a bit of heat and send out light. Gathering into a torch, take the lead in being a good intimate person. People at all levels in the city suggest that cadres to consider the main battlefields of listening to the people's sentiments, solving the people's worries, and collecting civil wisdom, focusing on the tasks of preventing and controlling the targets, and always paying attention to the people's anxiety and hope, and strive to turn the masses ""ideas"". They should be a good listener, set up a ""research hotline"" by phone, carefully communicate, patient and guidance, and respond to the trust and expectations of the masses ""compare their hearts to the heart."" They do a good job of investigating the investigator, in -depth communication with relevant departments and the grassroots of the community, analyzing the causes, and research countermeasures, and transforming the people's wisdom into a war ""epidemic"" golden idea. When they set up through the traffic, the people suggested that they entered the field of decision -making, transformed into work measures, and jointly built the group defense line to control the defense line, gathered the wisdom and strength of the masses for the prevention and control of the epidemic.

Space ,Walk together in the same boat ,Space ,"Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, the people have suggested that it has been an important platform for listening to the voices of the masses, bringing together the wisdom of the masses, and helping resistance to epidemic work. There are such groups of people who may have different identities, different posts, and different environments, but they are returning to the city as soon as possible, observing, thinking, and acting. They have a common name: suggestor. The following is their self -report -to contribute to the volunteer classification protection guidelines to release Xue Yali in a timely manner. I am a scientific researcher. In the prevention and control of the epidemic, the participation of power can be taken for granted. On March 16th, the community in my community was strictly “2+12” strict community health management, and community workers were in a hurry. On the 19th, the ""volunteer group"" appeared in the WeChat group of the community, and my husband and I immediately scanned the code to join. On the 20th, the first day of the volunteer went to work, the wind and rain were heavy, and the sheds were blown up. I saw that some volunteers were incomplete protection equipment, lacking clothes and hats; rainwater wet glasses, they would wipe out of the mirror; passed the items gloves, and sometimes they did not replace it ... I admire the spirit of the volunteers, But also worried about many protective hazards. Volunteers are a door of community security. If they are infected due to improper protection, the safety of the entire community is difficult to guarantee. I thought of it: I want to make suggestions for the security protection of volunteers! I suggested to the people to solicit the mailbox and submit an article ""Suggestions for preparing the"" Classification Guidance Manual of Community Anti -Volunteer Volunteers ""as soon as possible"", and put forward the need to conduct pre -job training, classify guidance, optimize job logo, and launch electronics in advance of volunteers. Suggestions such as version manuals. Soon after, I received a call from the Municipal Volunteer Association, thanked I made the suggestions and introduced their work. Immediately after, I saw a large number of knowledge articles and training videos about volunteer security protection on various information platforms. In early May, a ""Classification Protection Guide for Evolution Prevention and Control Volunteers"" was released on multiple public accounts such as ""Shanghai Release"". In our volunteers in our community, I also clearly feel that everyone has a stronger protection awareness and more standardized protection behavior. As a community volunteer, the experience of this proposal reminds me that scholars' work is not only in the house, but also to the outside of the house. I think this is the score and responsibility of being a scholar. The precisely helping the express delivery of the courier's electronic pass on the launch of Wu Yanwei. I am a member of the Democratic Party. I have collected public opinion, actively conducting investigations, and putting forward reasonable suggestions. It is not only an important way to participate in politics, but also the expression of the city. In early April, Shanghai launched nucleic acid code to directly bind the results of nucleic acid detection results with the information of the person being detected. It played an active role in improving the efficiency of nucleic acid detection registration and reducing the burden of test personnel. However, the ""nucleic acid code"" screenshot can be used repeatedly in 30 days, but to a certain extent, the risk point of the inspection inspection is added. To this end, I investigated the cadres, residents of the community, and experts and friends in the field of big data, listened to their ideas and recorded them one by one. ""Suggestions"" should be proposed to improve personnel information recognition, strengthen big data monitoring and management, and strengthen the prevention management of high -risk mobile personnel such as express delivery and takeaway riders. It is recommended to submit to the people's suggestion to collect the mailbox and get positive responses soon. Fortunately, this suggestion was finally adopted by the relevant departments. In late April, the ""electronic pass"" of the delivery and delivery personnel was launched, and a variety of technical means were adopted to strengthen the dynamic monitoring of information to effectively prevent the emergence of ""on -the -job on -the -job"" behavior. Dedicate the power to form a torrent of resistance. I believe that we can quickly set up the sun and see the rainbow after the rain! The vaccination work of the elderly has gradually promoted Ni Xiaoru. I am a retired teacher. During the epidemic, in addition to actively cooperating with the community to do various epidemic prevention work, I also have a ""enthusiastic proposal"" identity. In early April, at a press conference of the epidemic prevention and control, I learned that the elderly group was a high-risk group of High-risk and death in the infection of Omikon, and their COVID-19 vaccination rate was relatively low. This set of data made me feel deeply shocking. I contacted my friends of the same age and found that many people feel that such a big age is not necessary. In case of adverse reactions, there will be a kind of people who are lucky: they think that they are rarely traveled, and the virus cannot find the virus. Own. Therefore, I wrote a suggestion on ""strengthening the COVID-19 vaccine and strengthening needle vaccination"", pointing out that in the current critical period of epidemic prevention, we must grasp the prevention and control, grasp the vaccination in one hand, and target the elderly groups. Propaganda guidance to eliminate their concerns. After the proposal was submitted, it was valued by the Municipal People's Proposal. They communicated with me for the first time, understood the situation, improved the content, and soon submitted to the relevant competent authorities for research. The Municipal Health and Health Commission and the Municipal Disease Prevention Center are very sure of my suggestions and give positive responses. Soon, the city's press conference put forward the work requirements of strengthening the vaccination of elderly groups. The front line of resistance requires soldiers, and I can also be relieved as the proposal as a proposal. The advice allows the nucleic acid detection sampling service to be the people and the people Wu Hao. I am a grass -roots cadre. In mid -March, I have just completed the epidemic prevention and control of the first line of the village in the first line of the village. In the front line of epidemic prevention, I found that with the changes in the prevention and control situation, the demand for nucleic acid detection in groups, community residents, and urban protection operations has increased. The information update is not timely, and the convenience of serving special groups such as takeaway brothers and elderly people is insufficient. I think that the normalized nucleic acid sampling point is closely related to everyone's life travel. Everyone cares about whether the location is convenient, whether the sampling is safe, and whether the service is convenient. Therefore, I thought about writing a ""suggestion on improving normalized nucleic acid samples and the public"". , Reasonably arrange points, service time, etc.; On the other hand, we must consider emergency needs, such as the coming of summer, prepare some heatstroke and cooling materials, add a shading and rain -shining facilities, and open the green passage of the old and young. Essence After the proposal was proposed, the comrades of the Municipal Collection Office quickly got in touch with me, discussed and jointly studied together, and supplemented the suggestions. This proposal was affirmed and concerned by the undertaking department. Whether it is suggestions and suggestions or participation in prevention and control, I have no blame. I will also continue to work hard to contribute to win the battle for the Greater Shanghai. The first line of walking is a decision to make a decision on the community's epidemic prevention information. I am a foreign -owned employee. After my home office, I report to the community and devote themselves to volunteer services to contribute to everyone. During my work, I found that because residents could not obtain the epidemic information of the community in time, residents in the same community and the same building were easily suspected of each other, and it was easy to cause unnecessary panic and increased the difficulty of community work. I think, if there is a briefing and publicity in the residential area every day in the WeChat group in a timely manner, such as the summary of the nucleic acid and antigen detection results, the specific buildings where the infected personnel are located, and the separation and transfer status of the diagnostic personnel, etc., not only It can make everyone feel at ease and enhance the consciousness of residents' cooperation with the implementation of epidemic prevention policies. In order to better verify, I have exchanged with colleagues in other communities. Everyone generally feels that the information is publicly disclosed in a timely manner. As a result, in combination with field investigations and residents, I proposed to the people to solicit the messenger to submit suggestions on refining the disclosure of epidemic prevention information and better implementation of the ""four response"" work. After the discussion and improvement of the staff of the Municipal Collection Office, it is recommended to transfer it to the relevant departments in the form of a report. Later, I found that more and more residential areas began to release their own epidemic prevention work information in a timely manner, and the content and style of content and styles became richer. Nowadays, I have been devoted to the community's special voluntary operation of drugs and ran in the street community to contribute to the resistance to resistance.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/7.htm,5/17/22,Edition 7: Shanghai People's Suggestion Collection ,
Space,Avenue to Jane Mother's Love Rushan,—— Mourning Teacher Qin Yi,"On May 9th, in the early morning, I turned on my phone and saw two unbelievable calls. It was called by Mr. Qin Yi's daughter Fifi. I sank in my heart, and the two phone calls were definitely a bad situation at Teacher Qin Yi so early, and immediately called back to Sister Fei Fei, but I played a dozen in a row. I immediately called the troupe, Director Yan Lin and Secretary Xu Wen, and couldn't get through, and then called the head of Tong Ruixin, and I didn't get through. My heart began to panic. Is it ... I guess, the head of the Tong Ruixin made the phone call, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no When I asked more, I told me directly: ""Teacher Qin Yi left at 4 o'clock this morning!"" It is reasonable that Teacher Qin Yi is 100 years old and will face the desperation of life and death at any time, but today I just accept it today. Can't this reality. I was sorrowful and washed my face with tears, but I had a movie like a movie in my mind. A show, this show, I was invited to do it once, and asked who this time, the director said, ""Teacher Qin Yi, she names you as her guest."" Teacher Qin Yi and I should be two generations. People, she is my idol. When he was young, Mr. Qin Yi's name was one of the ""four famous Dans"" in the drama industry in the 1940s. After 1949, she played the young female worker Ma Lan in the movie ""Ma Lanhua"", which was very sweet. I love to watch ""Railway Guerrillas"". The role of ""Fang Linyu"" created by Teacher Qin Yi is really a household name and popular. Her old man loves to sing ""Play my beloved native pipa and sing the moving song"". "" Essence After that, Teacher Qin Yi made a series of films such as ""Women's Basketball No. 5"", ""Song of Youth"" and ""Overseas Red"", and became the most popular movie stars that year. , Received by Chairman Mao ... such a senior and famous performing artist, such a senior teacher of Deyi Shuangxin, named me the guest of her show, can I do it? So, said to the TV station, ""How can I? I can't take it."" But the other party replied: ""This was set by Mr. Qin Yi. Since she ordered you, she has her own truth. . ""This says, no matter how much I am in my heart, I can't hesitate. When I arrived at the TV station, I saw Teacher Qin Yi, who was full of silver hair, and was spiritual. As soon as she appeared, she won applause and admiration on the audience. She came with her son ""little brother"". I immediately understood that the main topic was around the ""little brother"". Mr. Qin Yi's son is called ""little brother"". In fact, he is not small, but people in their fifties look like a minor child. Teacher Qin Yi began to talk about the situation of her son when he was onset, and how did she bring her son. ""Little Brother"" named Jin Jie, his father was once a well -known film emperor Jin Yan. When Jin Jie was young, he was healthy and smart, and he learned something very fast. However, because Qin Yi and Jin Yan are both film actors, they have been filming for a long time, and they cannot always be with the child, so they have to let him enter the child. In the trustees, being bullied by the eldest child, they are often broken by people, and even scratched by small knives. He was introverted and shy since he was a child, and he dared not say when he returned home. Teacher Qin Yi could not think that her son had already suffered from depression. It wasn't until the age of seventeen that the condition broke out and developed from depression to schizophrenia that she felt serious. She was reluctant to send her son to a mental hospital. Every time she went out to shoot, she always brought her son with her and took care of his diet and living in order to make up for the arrears for so many years. It's my turn. I said, why did Teacher Qin Yi call me especially today? Because we have participated in a lot of activities together, China Film Association, Shanghai Film Association, Literary Federation, and some public welfare activities in other places, Teacher Qin Yi and I attended them together. Every time Qin Yi came out with her son, it was not easy. I felt that she was the best mother in the world. There is a problem with ""little brother"" intelligence. She doesn't care what others say, but always do everything that mother should do. How can such a mother not get the sympathy and respect of people around the people! Therefore, every time I have an activity, I step forward to help her and actively support the ""younger brother"". After getting in the car, as long as the ""little brother"" can speak, I will find some topics he can accept to chat with him, so that Mr. Qin Yi, who is working hard at home, rest. In this minor thing, Teacher Qin Yi has been in his heart. She always feels that I can understand her and go closer to her. From the perspective of a mother, I admire Teacher Qin Yi. Later, the ""little brother"" lived at Ruijin Hospital, and I went to visit after I knew it. Teacher Qin Yi wore a blue care suit in the hospital, a hat, a mask, and a full armed, like an old caregiver. When her son was doing hemorrhage, she stayed in the ward. After a while, she managed the tube, a quilt for a while, and fed her son some warm water for a while ... It's really poor parents in the world. I just feel that I have to find a place to wipe a touch of tears. My mother is not around, and I treat Teacher Qin Yi as her mother, as an old artist, a teacher, no matter how great the respect is, it is not comparable -my mother! For her, I couldn't help much, at most, I just stepped forward when I was together. I always held her up and down the steps up and down the steps. Whenever I always think in my heart, how much perseverance and strongness of such a woman have to come to this day? In the eyes of outsiders, Teacher Qin Yi is graceful and luxurious, and the scenery is unlimited. Look at her, a pair of golden glasses, with her bright smile, especially the clean breath between the eyebrows, it seems difficult to find a few for decades in the showbiz. Such a woman should be favored by people who should reach out and open their mouths. However, she is an ordinary housewife at home. She can do it by sherself, and even underwear was washed by her own. It seems to be a trivial matter, but it is amazing. I have always regarded her as a model in her own life! Her life is very frugal, but she is very positive. Remember to perform a righteous performance, to donate. You just look at her. Do not open up the money publicly, but pay it out from your own bag under the table. ""No!"" She took the bag again and took a closer look. After that, she quietly donated all the money, at least 10,000 yuan. There are many things like this. In 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake, Teacher Qin Yi donated only 200,000 yuan in cash at hand, and donated them all. Others asked her how to live, she said that she still had salary. This month was gone, and she would come next month. Teacher Qin Yi is such a person full of love, thinking of others, but always forgets himself. Being meticulous; acting is also meticulous. I often perform with Teacher Qin Yi and filming together. The impression she left to me is to be very awe of her work. We filmed the TV series ""Mother Earth World"" together. She was afraid that she would go to the toilet to delay the shooting time. Whenever recitation works, she will try to memorize the recitation manuscript from head to the end. She said that she would not look down on the manuscript, but did not communicate with the audience. If she encounters a large section of lines, she always wonders how to present the most beautiful and best image to the audience. Teacher Qin Yi often said that beauty can add points to the actors, but it is not enough to play a role. The characters are all people. First of all, the role is true! She said seriously and did it seriously. These little bit of things are really a spur and a kind of incentive for actors of our small characters. When I watched the film ""Qinghai Lake"", which was edited and performed in the extreme age of her acting career, I couldn't help crying. Her sincerity, her temperament, her attachment, infection and inspiring me from time to time. Today, Teacher Qin Yi suddenly left and left us forever. The biggest regret left to me is because the epidemic could not see her last, and sent her the last journey ... I could only tears and shouted in my heart: Farewell Once, my mother -like teacher Qin Yi! Avenue to Jane, motherly love is like mountains!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/8.htm,5/17/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup,

It is not chaotic, and the ""China -EU trains"" on Eurasia on the Eurasian continent is a microcosm of Shanghai's full efforts to ensure the supply chain and the smooth industrial chain. On September 28 last year, the ""China-Europe Train-Shanghai No."" officially opened. By using the unique advantages of international railway transportation, it has become an important channel for Shanghai to stabilize the Eurasian continent and integrate into the domestic and international dual cycles. At the end of March of this year, the COVID-19 outbreak swept Shanghai, bringing severe challenges to international trade. How to ensure ""things smooth""?

Space,Reading Lang under the Wisteria Book,Space,"Among the Jusuo plants, I like the unrestrained climbing vines. In the color, the noble and quiet purple is my favorite. During the growth of my son, the scenes of reading under the wisteria are nostalgic. I used to hiking to the world's most well -known Wisteria Garden in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. I felt the shame of the four 150 -year -old wisteria old trees when it was flowing, but I still prefer the first rattan in Tokyo. The Turtle Tianshe Shrine has implanted more humanities in plants. I remember the year when I went to the year of my son's high school college, because the Katsuo Shrine, like the Tianman Palace Shrine, is a shrine that worships the knowledge and is a spiritual place for students to pray for the title of the gold list. However, the wisteria in the home is the most favorite but not replaced. In the last year of the last century, Ai'er in Huaijie returned from Tokyo to his hometown of Shanghai. Looking for it, he finally settled in a deep courtyard and a deep -purple -purple exterior wall. The east wall of the cold house south south, from south to north, with the wisteria promenade with annual wheels, the trunk with thick wrist arms twisted on the straight wooden frame. The gesture is simple and charming, and the rattan is entangled. After year, the vine flower is purple every year. In the early spring, the new branches are green and green, and the wisteria flower stand is not as strong as the wisteria along the set path, looking for the light of the sun. Sky. In the spring, the branches on the wisteria trunk of the wall still followed the corner of the vine frame, and squeezed the vine tip into the bedroom on the second floor with their heads. The courtyard deep corridor is long, and the long vine is trapped to a far and far ahead. Under the wisteria frame, the little reading Lang who reads the picture of fairy tale books must be led far and far in the dreamy world. It's right. The beauty of the years, beauty in its quietness, and beauty in its passage. How many people are the wisteria flowers in our hearts in our hearts, it is worthy of our pace to nost. The courtyard is deep in vines. Whether it is sadness or joy, sadness, or doing nothing, it becomes a habit under the Wisteria Gallery. The flowers of the late spring, the green shade of the summer, the leaves of the late autumn, the remnants of the winter, the four -time scenery of the Wisteria Corridor is just like a dream, and every curtain of each season is on my heart, and the best -hearted curtain should be used as In the late spring, the wisteria flowers in the purple transparent blue are set off on the wall of the light purple house, and the pulse is integrated into it. It is steamed in the hazard in the east of the purple gas ... A few miles of wind and spring, and the wisteria flowers in front of the court. The most beautiful moment of the wisteria is the appearance of Ziguang Ying, Mu Mu's leisurely swaying in the wind, and in this most beautiful moment to drunk in the benches under the bentess of the wisteria flower stand, holding the children's picture album and read the Lang Langlang Essence The wisteria flowers in the courtyard are growing and complex, the more the wisteria leaves are growing, and the more and more honeydles. Every year and year, the life of the life of the purple ears is also more and more mellow. As the wisteria tree rotes rotate the year, the son gradually grows up. The courtyard, sometimes flying home. Memories are like old and warm photos, like blurred and warm books, and the background of purple petals to basement makes the past years with poetry. One day, the second grade of elementary school read the pot pottery made from the school from the school, and pulled me to see my handmade works. The blue glaze color is in front of the eyes. ""Abao, what is this stuff?"" ""Mom, guess, it’ s the joy of Nong ... "" The amount in the stream ... ""I shook my head puzzled. He reminded me again, ""On the trip, Ala also put it in the rice noodle paste and then removed it, put it in the oil pan and made petal tempura ..."" ""Oh, it is under the wisteria frame in the Ara courtyard The wisteria flowers. ""I shouted loudly. In the late spring, the wisteria flowers bloom. The petals bloom, the blue purple spray, and the time is also opened. Reading Lang under the wisteria frame of the Qingxi courtyard was full of my heart. The wisteria waterfall in front of him was fixed as an anchor, which riven the passing spring. In the clouds of time, the blue sky of consciousness hangs down from the shallow to deep flowers, and the purple purple is spreading. The spread of the spread of hand fists is gradually released, so that the wisteria flowers bloom and hold the childlike heart firmly. The spring breeze was blowing, the wisteria was full, the fragrance of the courtyard, the scenery was still, but there was a small reading Lang in the wisteria. The son's handmade pottery tank became my treasure. I put it in my study, free up enough space on the bookshelf, let it put it steadily and properly. I was sitting in front of the table, regardless of spring, summer, autumn and winter, as long as I look up, I can see purple. The autumn and winter wind is tight, the leaves are falling, leaving strong dry branches and branches. I wander in the lonely wisteria promenade, thinking of Sichuan Duancheng said that this wisteria flower knows the most sadness. Isn't Wisteria's flower language of Yiyi! Wisteria flowers bloom in the middle spring, and there are always a little sadness and nostalgia in the late spring. Lu Xun's only love novel ""Wound"", deeply looking forward to combining with wisteria outside the window, with hazy beauty. The wisteria flowers are full of courtyards, and the beauty of Zijun and Juansheng will become a trick to Zi Jun. Nostalgia forever. The courtyard full of wisteria flowers, but no wisteria flower stands under the wisteria flower stand. Spring cannot stay, and the wisteria flowers gradually dusk. ""Wisteria is windy."" I stood under the wisteria, thinking of Wang Zengqi's words. The wind in the wisteria blows from the past. Wisteria flowers are fragmented, and the wrapped vine, is not the nostalgia that cannot be put down in his heart.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/6.htm,5/18/22,,
Space,"""I don't do it for him, who does it for him?""",Miss Grandma Li Qianghua,"In Wang Yueyang's continuous rain, a generation of Peking Opera, Grandma Li Qiang, died at the age of 93. At this point, as one of the second -generation Peking Opera ""Chengpai"" art inheritor of the ""Chengpai Five Old"", all the curtains are all sad and sad. As a Peking Opera Performing Artist and a national non -inheritor, Grandma Qiang Hua can be described as famous in his life. The audience was deeply influenced by Mr. Cheng Yanqiu, a generation of masters, can be described as true. In the art of inheriting the ""Chengpai"" art, Grandma Qianghua focuses on focusing and very rigorous, especially in terms of learning the ""Chengpai"" vocalist and the artistic characteristics of the inner softness and rigidity. The coordination of the cavity is full, and it has been highly recognized by the industry experts. In addition to singing, the ""Chengpai"" art performance has high requirements for the Water Sleeve Kung Fu in Yuanchang, and Grandma Qianghua is also very exciting. It should be said that the biggest characteristics and advantages of the Peking Opera ""Chengpai"" art shown on her is the rules, specifications, and tradition. For more than 70 years, Grandma Qiang Hua has always emphasized: ""I never dare to change the art of the Qiu Qiu, even if I never dare to change the art of the Qiu Qiu, even Drop, because I don't have that ability and level. ""Therefore, her stage performance is always regular and rigorous, seeing kung fu everywhere, giving people beautiful enjoyment. In addition to the outstanding art, Grandma Qiang Hua is a good mother and a good wife in life. In her later years, another eye -catching identity was the wife of Mr. Yu Zhenfei, a generation of masters. As we all know, she has a deep relationship with Mr. Yu Zhenfei. She once told me that at that time, some of them were single to walk together in their old age. Yu Lao was looking forward to this, but because both of them were celebrities of Liyuan, they met in Guangzhou for the first time. As soon as I met, Yu Lao peeled off a sugar and handed it over, and said to Grandma Qiang Hua with a smile: ""If this is done, you're wronged."" Like a dating boy. Grandma Qianghua reported a smile, and gently took the sugar from Yu Lao ... In this way, the two artists walked into each other's life in their later years. She told me frankly that at the beginning, her feelings for Yu Lao were more sympathetic than love, thinking that such a highly respected artist was lonely in his old age, no one took care of, and could not bear it, so he was willing to let go of what he had enjoyed in Wuhan. All honors, status and treatment, and even sacrificed their artistic career, willingly came to Shanghai willingly to start with Mrs. Yu and take care of the elderly in their lives. Unexpectedly, I have been together for a long time. The relationship between the two is getting better and better, and no one can do without anyone. In his later years, thanks to the care, care and care of Grandma Qiang Hua, there was nothing to do with it. In the last few years of Yu Lao's life, she was sick in bed, and Grandma Qiang Hua took care of the elderly. Tea could not be hot. She only drank soup with chicken. Other patients rest, Grandma Qiang Hua gently stroked Yu Lao's face when he came to visit the next day, and said to him with a smile: ""I want to sing a show, wait for me, sing to me, okay?"" Looking at my love wife, looking at my wife, Yu Lao smiled. Once, Grandma Qianghua was hospitalized and was hospitalized. Yu Lao insisted on going to the hospital to visit his beloved wife. He also cut a Apple for Grandma Qiang Hua ... There are many such stories, and the two old people are embarrassed. And for these past events, Grandma Qiang Hua had only one sentence: ""Yu Lao is so amazing artists, these things, I don't do it for him, who do it for him?"" After the death of Lao Yu, Grandma Qiang Hua put a large number of precious information in the house in the house. All donated to the Shanghai Library, established a complete set of Yu Zhenfei art archives, and was very good. After that, any commemorative activity of Yu Lao can always see her busy figure, especially for the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe that Yu Lao is most concerned about. In 2019, at the celebration party at the 40th anniversary of the founding of Shangkun, Li Qianghua, the older group of the old group Cai Zhengren, appeared on the stage of the Shanghai Grand Theater. The picture makes people present! One year, some improper remarks of the book ""Fanmo Life Makeup"" caused Yu Lao's reputation to be damaged. Grandma Qiang Hua was filled with indignation. Legal weapons to maintain their reputation for Yu Lao. Yu Lao performed at the age of 109. She and Cai Zhengren co -starred in ""The Dream of Spring Girlfriends"", which was allowed to sing. At that time, in ""The Dream of Spring Girlfriend"", Cheng Yanqiu played Zhang's, Yu Zhenfei played Wang Hui, and the two art masters were the same, and the beads were combined. This time, it was played by Li Qianghua and Cai Zhengren. However, that year, she was an 83 -year -old man, and she couldn't help wondering: This one -hour ""Spring Girlfriend"", the aria, the body is difficult, can it be carried? On the day of the performance, I saw Zhang's player played and walked out quickly. After two or three steps, she turned around and immediately sounded applause. The sound is high, such as frost and sky cranes; its sound is quiet, such as empty Valley Quanming, high and low, and the control is free. What is more rare is that for the water sleeves, action and even expression, Grandma Qiang Hua is meticulous. The joy of reunion for a long time is still so good. I took a picture of a water -shaking sleeve. Grandma Qiang Hua liked it very much. She asked me to enlarge her and put it at home. The gods on the stage are amazing. However, as soon as he arrived in the background, Grandma Qianghua couldn't help vomiting, lying on the table, and it couldn't be slow for a long time. After 40 minutes, Grandma Qiang slowly raised his head and said to us with a smile: ""I came here."" When saying this, she smiled and hung her mouth. She was glad that she and Yu Zhenfei finally cooperated with Yu Zhenfei. The ""Spring Girl Dream"" has completed the best commemoration of Yu Lao ... Afterwards, I asked her, so old, all the singing sings, is it worth it? She still said: ""This is what I should do. I don't do it for him, who does it for him?"" This year is Yu Lao's 120th birthday. Grandma Qianghua died at the age of 93. The legend of the fairy family couple followed ... I hope she will go all the way! We will always miss her beauty, gentleness, strong, and the unique art of ""entering the journey"" and high standards!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/7.htm,5/18/22,The 7th edition: Nightlight Cup:,

When Zhengzhou and Wang Chungang of Shanghai Yuwan Industrial Co., Ltd. drove on the road to Shanghai, they gave them. Send a help information. Three minutes later, the ringtone of the mobile phone rang, and the answer was simply and sharp: ""This matter is given to us!"" The Buick Business car immediately detoured from Hunan to Hubei and went straight to Zhejiang Huzhou. At 18:00 on May 16th, the Huzhou section of the Shanghai -Kunming Expressway, ""Mother Yaoshen"" and ""Transit Car God"" connected their heads. Holding a large box of ""life -saving medicine"", which was wrapped tightly by the quilt from the refrigerator 20 minutes ago, Ms. Xu got on the car. 2 hours later, the transport car drove a pediatric hospital affiliated to Fudan University. After the ""Mother Yaoshen Mom"" finished the nucleic acid test and determined that after the next day, she could accompany her son to the hospital for chemotherapy. The car rushed to Ms. Xu and five other treasures near the hospital. Mom's temporary place. At this time, the secretary of the neighborhood committee had been waiting at the door of the community.

Space,Update and restart,Space,"Zhang Xin has recently seen a video very inspiring, saying that people with a little age and grades are easier for themselves to stop themselves. It is wrong to accept or assertive as long as they do not attach to their values or beyond their own cognitive range. However, this is an era of updating the concept. In addition to being adhered to many simple truths and common sense, it is difficult to improve if you do not think about all issues. In fact, people can grow and progress in their lives, which requires us to have an open mind. I am an old -fashioned person. For example, I agree with the word to avoid shortness, because the ten fingers have long and short, and the principle of doing what I am good at is very correct. But I just have a friend (not to mention the suspicion of being enthusiastic), her characteristic is that she is not afraid of the shortcomings, and some of them are ""the more difficult the more dangerous, the more forward"". For example: She is a writer, and she expresss in public in public. She has neither a leader nor a teacher. It is not easy to eat food. When we started activities at the beginning, her speech was a bit unclear, and her expression was not as clear as her article. This must be obvious shortcomings, if I am, I will choose to avoid pit. But she just chose to talk more, exercise more, and constantly revise and restart. As a result, she said very well now. Recently, she has done an event with her. Her speech has a clear theme, clear views, relaxation, and streamlined. Therefore, it is not impossible to change the long -term avoidance to the self -challenge. If you just admit your disadvantages and avoid it blindly, then of course it will always be our shortcomings. Another example is the definition of self -confidence. For example, ""seeking people is better to ask for yourself"" is also a great truth that is not broken, but today the society emphasizes that ""let professional people do professional things."" Facts have fully proved that it is not possible to solve all problems by relying on their own ambitions. Successful people in one field may be mediocre in another field. This is normal, because the division of labor is becoming more and more refined, and there are really few all talents. Therefore, as soon as I heard that real estate developers want to make electric vehicles, I feel where he comes from. And we do n’t want to ask for people, if we do n’t understand the industry we do n’t understand, ask professionals with an open mind, and respect whether their opinions and majors are great. Essence It is also good to leave the opportunity to those who may play better, or young people. Is this the update and restart of the concept? So you still have to learn for life and never close. This is not a change of ideas, but a life attitude.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/7.htm,5/19/22,,
Space,Walking Jiangwan,Space,"Zhang Yiwei recently missed the Hongkou River Bay, which often walked in March. Passing through the south road of the station along the commemorative road, you will encounter a driver's training ground, and go to the end, which is Liangcheng, which is a lively place for citizens. When there is no epidemic, there are people with square dances at night, and they can hear the sound of music from a distance. Behind the scene of the square dance, about eleven o'clock, you will see many young people walking dogs, they are their at night. This way is lonely, even if it is not an epidemic, night is empty. You can see good -looking Fuxing Senior High School. This is an old middle school. The school was formerly known as the ""Meshenik"" school. It was founded in 1886 and moved into the name ""Tom Hanbi Boys Public School"" in 1915. Sometimes I turn around on the water circuit and pass through the station North Road Kui Zhao Road, and I will reach the Wan'an Road, which is about to demolish, is also another style. There may be four to five braised beef noodles along the road, and there may be many people who like noodles around them. There are also small shops of less than one square meter. At night, they are still selling green onion cakes of two -free and two baskets of two baskets. It can be seen that Laojiang Bay is sitting in the water network and buying and selling. Wan'an Road has only known each other in the past two years. The teaching class took the Graduate Cisa of Fudan's creative writing many times. Last year, he cooperated with the media to ""Shanghai Local Writing Plan"" and walked again. Take our student guides, talk about the history of Sanguantang directly starting from the Qing Dynasty, do not recognize life at all, do not care about raining, and do not care about time. I took some videos and did not expect to go to the building for half a year. Wanan Road has almost moved now. When I knew it, it had disappeared. Sanguantang was originally a venue of Taoism. After more than two hundred years, it was changed to a Buddhist temple. At the beginning of the liberation of Shanghai, there were three Taoist temples in Jiangwan Town. The front line of Wan'an Road was on the east side of the Sanguantang, that is, the original Dongwang (Yue) Temple on the east side of Yixian Road; on the west of Wan'an Road, that is, that is, that is, The original Niu Lao Temple at Yangnan Road. We interviewed an old town mayor named Ni Weimin. He said that he was in the elementary school in the East King Temple. He went to school every day from school. On the right is Prince Yan and the left is Guan Gong. When ""March 28th River Bay"", local primary school students can take three days of vacation, and students in the city do not leave leave, so he has been looking forward to it from March 1. Now the Dongwang Temple and the Cowherd Temple are gone. Interestingly, the air -conditioning guardrail of the opposite community is the pattern of Sanguantang stick figure shape. I do n’t know if it ’s a community plan, or it’ s sponsored by Sanguantang. At the beginning of March, fresh e -commerce companies were in a hurry. Fruit shops, grain and oil shops, and vegetable shops near Chunsheng Street and Kuixing Pavilion were sufficient to buy cheap eggs, bamboo shoots and strawberries. There are as many as six or seven in barber shops, and there are more clerks than customers. Every time I passed by Longteng Community, I stopped. Because some people said that there was a comfort place there during the Anti -Japanese War. Twenty years ago, a Korean lady came here to find, but found no relics. The teacher of the China ""Comfort Women"" Research Center of Shanghai Normal University announced in 2015 to publish a group of photos of Jiangwan's comfort institutes. Later, it was included in the book ""Evidence: The Secrets of Shanghai 172 Comfort Institute"". Thinking of these photos, along the road, along the road The vicissitudes of vicissitudes deepened a lot. Then fold back to the railway and pass through Yixian Road, you can see the flowers under the elevated, there are vibrant. From Xuefu Street to the dormitory of Fudan North District, which has been living for 3 years, I hurriedly thought of time, but I never had patience and idleness as now. Stop. Last year I will continue to go towards Xinjiang Bay and go until the wetland. From ancient times to Caochuang, from heavy to light, the air will become more and more refreshing, and the sound of birds will become clearer. Although it is also called ""Jiangwan"", the style is very different. Going towards Hongkoujiang Bay, that is vicissitudes of local earthen; walking towards Jiangwan Sports Center, that is the place in Shanghai most like Taipei City; walking to Xinjiang Bay City is to me like this ""Jiangwan ""Outsiders are more likely to approach. My favorite wetland park atrium, every afternoon, there will be seven or eight saxophone musicians, and at the same time, it is amazing that they can start, end, and blow differently at the same time. I will stay there for a long time. Most of their audiences hold Shiba Inu. In the bird watching pavilion, there are uncles with complete equipment and long guns and short guns. There is another group of Jiang Tai Gong by the river. But I have never figured out which bird in the bird watching pavilion, and I did not wait for a jumping Jiangwan fish. In this way, sometimes it is dark, sometimes it is dark until late at night.

"From the excitement, embarrassment, and stress of the first day of resumption, to today's stability, firmness, and confidence","Overcoming difficulties in Shanghai foreign companies to overcome the difficulties with the ""re -""",Space,"At more than 6 o'clock in the morning, the Nivia Shanghai Manufacturing Center in Qingpu Industrial Park successively appeared. The workers had a good antigen test before entering the production area. At 7 o'clock, the production line was opened on time, and a bottle of skin care products were quickly packaged. The finished product was raised and put down with the robotic arm, and another box was placed neatly. Looking at the fast -rotating assembly line, Chen Shengxiang, general manager of the center of the center, intersects. From the excitement, stingy, and stressfulness of the first day of the resumption of work, to today's stability, firmness, and confidence. Unconsciously, it is also the toughness of foreign companies' determination to keep the ""Shanghai"". The sound of the machine, the production line was reopened in Qingpu, Shanghai, and lived in Kunshan, Jiangsu. Chen Shengxiang was a typical cross -city commuters in the Yangtze River Delta. But since March 21, he has not returned home. ""The notice received at first was Puxi sealing for 4 days. Therefore, after leaving the factory on the evening of March 31, I stayed in the hotel and waited for the construction on April 5th. Watching the press conference every day, I look forward to resumption of work every day. ""Because Nivea Shanghai Manufacturing Center is the only production base in China in China, the national sales channels are basically waiting for us to supply."" Shuguang came in mid -April. Lei Kaiting, general manager of the Chinese Enterprise Affairs of Bayeros, remembers it very clearly that it didn't take long for the resumption of work and the employee list. Qingpu Industrial Park approved the resumption of work on April 21. On the evening of April 22, Chen Shengxiang first returned to the factory area. Too late to la with emotion, he immediately devoted himself to the tension. ""We are advanced troops. We need to receive epidemic prevention materials such as masks, protective clothing, disinfection water, arrange food, tents, bedding and other living materials, and welcome employees the next day."" The whole staff has twice nucleic acids. The factory area finally sounded the sound of machine. Today, more than 100 employees have implemented closed management in the factory area, and multiple production lines operate efficiently, returning to 40%of the production capacity during the same period. Closed -loop production, foreign companies that connect the industrial chain to return to the rails are not just Best Daoff. On May 13, Wu Jinsheng, director of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, said that the city has promoted more than 3,000 ""white list"" enterprises with more than 3,000 re -production and production, of which 847 foreign -funded enterprises have reached 80%. On May 15th, Gu Jun, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Commission, said that the city has released two batches of ""white list"" of key foreign trade enterprises, including cargo trade, service trade, foreign headquarters and port service enterprises, a total of 704 Home. More than 820 lists will also be released recently. With an important supply task, Bosch China in Shanghai's two automotive parts factories and a thermal technology factories in Shanghai are in closed -loop production during the epidemic. Chen Yudong, president of Bosch China, said that the epidemic has gradually eased. We have seen the trend of active improvement. At present, Bosch's output capacity is between 30%and 75%. Siemens Healthcare Shanghai R & D and production bases have been included in the first batch of key re -work enterprises ""Whitening"". More than 300 employees have been managed in the factory closed -loop management and have achieved full load production to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. Kong Jun, senior vice president and general manager of Shanghai Ximenzi Medical Equipment Co., Ltd., said that as more and more upstream and downstream enterprises resume work, raw material supply has gradually entered the right track and can meet the manufacturing requirements. Since the start of the work, the Qingpu factory of Xianniko Holdings Co., Ltd. has settled in four batches of production personnel, and the current production capacity has basically recovered. Chairman Lu Chuanxin said that the key to resumed work is that the upstream and downstream industrial chains are gradually opened. """" "". The three major difficulties still need to work hard to resume work and production, and it is not without difficulty. Bosch China stated that the lack of production capacity of resumed work is mainly facing three major difficulties in the lack of closed -loop management employees, poor logistics, and slow production of suppliers at all levels. Due to the long industrial chain, it still needs time and common efforts. ""Car has a long industrial chain, not only suppliers like Bosch and their first -level suppliers, but also more suppliers of suppliers who need to restore production. If the supply chain does not form a 'chain', the supply chain does In the end, it is impossible to produce products. ""Chen Yudong said that he hopes that more partners on the supply chain can quickly resume work. Bayer Steve also feels the same. Chen Shengxiang told reporters, ""A kind of carnitine raw material, this raw material supplier is located in Kangqiao, Pudong, Shanghai, and has been in the early stage that it cannot be shipped in the premium control. Finally, we urgently coordinated its Northeast factory and transferred from the Northeast to Suzhou to transfer to the warehouse. Only in direct Shanghai can ensure that production continues. ""However, Shanghai is still a market that foreign investment is highly attached to, and China's confidence has always been unchanged. In February of this year, Xian Nico announced its investment of US $ 100 million to build the Asia -Pacific regional headquarters on a total of 58 acres of land in Hangzhou Bay Development Zone, Fengxian District, Shanghai. Lu Chuanxin said that the investment plan has not changed, and the goal of the year has not changed. ""China continues to maintain the largest single market in Bosch Group.""

"After experiencing difficult and danger, it is slowly recovering as usual",Straight at Huashan Hospital Emergency Department,Space,"Our reporter, Liyang Huashan Road, was covered by Indus, and the blue lights flickered on the top of the ambulance on both sides of the road were dazzled. On the stretcher bed, lying on his eyes and weakness, his wife on the side answered the flow inquiry of the pre -inspection desk ""Dai Bai"". Through the face screen and the N95 mask, the nurse shouted with the elderly who decreased to hearing. Walking in, the emergency hall is not a panic in the imagination of outsiders -the patient waiting for the patient sitting away, and the patients lying on the aisle temporary infusion level from time to time looked up to see the progress of the infusion. Someone's noses needed to absorb an oxygen masks, and others immediately cast their vigilance; occasionally people wearing face screens and wearing isolation clothes walked into the clinic, which would make people wrong: whether she was medical or patient. At least, in the opinion of Chen Mingquan, director of the Emergency Department of Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, as usual emergency department seems to be returning. Of course, in that difficult day, like the emergency department that opened the door of Shencheng, it has experienced the thrill of grabbing life for patients in the hospital in a special period. Since the outbreak of the epidemic in March, the patients with crisis are more in the emergency department of Huashan Hospital General Hospital in Jing'an District every day. At the peak, more than 500 patients are poured into more than 500 patients. ""During the epidemic, there were all kinds of fetters when they came to the hospital and home. Those who could go to the emergency department could not be dragged."" Chen Mingquan said. This year is the third year of the work of the emergency doctor Zhou Wenzheng. In his words, a ""patient who may not forget for a lifetime"" was diagnosed during the epidemic. The patient's physical function is stable, but the chest tightness and breath, the heartbeat is particularly fast, and the pant is very powerful. As soon as he entered the clinic, Zhou Wenzhen's first reaction was the crisis of hyperthyroidism -this kind of disease mortality also known as ""thyroid storm"" was very high. After the inquiry, I learned that the drugs were not enough during the epidemic, and patients were taking irregularly; patients still suffered from cholecystitis, and the infection further induced the crisis of hyperthyroidism. Although it was identified in the shortest time, the condition turned sharply and eventually failed to save it. According to usual, emergency doctors will split them for them according to the severity of the patient's condition. The first category is called endangered patients. Such patients may be dead at any time and must be sent to the rescue room immediately. The second type is called critical illness. The patients with severe symptoms and may develop into one level at any time. Symptoms of life; type 4 patients do not have the symptoms of acute onset, and are generally called ""flowing patients"". For a long time, patients of the first and second categories accounted for 8%-10%of emergency patients, but under the epidemic, Chen Mingquan found that this number almost doubled, reaching 15%-20%. ""Some time ago, whether it was sent by an ambulance or the patients who came by themselves, the condition was very serious."" The nurse of the pre -inspection desk said. Everyone understands that when the situation of prevention and control is so severe and the transportation is so inconvenient, patients also choose to come to Huashan Hospital, which is a great trust in the hospital. Emergency people must do their best to save their lives! The treatment was the first Chen Mingquan to participate in the prevention and control of the Ebola epidemic in Africa. The Huashan Emergency and Remorative Calls of the Huashan Emergency and the Development Topic Clinic Management Team played the advantage of ""1+1> 2"" under the epidemic. ""Patients in the emergency consultation area have been screened by the pre -inspection desk. Once a high -risk factors are found, they will be prescribed by a hot risk; Emergency patients get homogeneous diagnosis and treatment. ""On the pre -examination, Chen Mingquan pointed to the reporter not far away. ""But in any case, the treatment is always the first!"" He said seriously. As long as the first and second types of patients arrive at the hospital, they will be sent to the rescue room immediately. The rescue room is full and there is a buffer rescue room; no matter how full, there is an emergency rescue room! ""On the one hand, it is necessary to maintain the stability of life signs, and all kinds of treatment measures are symptomatic; on the other hand, the detection under prevention and control is also very simple. First, do the antigen and know the results in a few minutes. The reporter saw at the scene that there was an waiting area on the side of the pre -inspection desk. Chen Mingquan explained that the third and fourth types of emergency patients need to measure the temperature, do antigen, and conduct epidemiological investigations simultaneously. Generally, about 5-10 minutes, nurses of the pre-testing desk can be classified for them. The temperature is high, the antigen is positive or there are high-risk factors. During this large Shanghai defense war, a considerable part of the medical institutions of Shencheng were transferred to support designated hospitals or squares. As one of the departments of the ""principle non -stop diagnosis"", did the medical power be stretched out of the emergency department? In the face of reporters' questions, Chen Mingquan waved his hand. ""The management team of Lingang Fangchang Hospital is Huashan Hospital, and the Baoshan Hospital of Huashan Hospital has also been converted to a designated hospital. Huashan Hospital has 4 negative pressure ambulances for the emergency department and hot kidney clinics. The transfer is very smooth and will not squeeze the 120 resources in the city. ""In his opinion, after the process is smooth, it saves labor. Expert clinics have resumed on March 28, and Pudong New District began to control management. The night before, many doctors and nurses in Pudong took the suitcase and rushed back to Puxi's head hospital overnight. For more than 50 days, nearly 130 emergency people fought together in three shifts and never returned home. ""Although we are on the front line, it is still safe to do well."" Zhou Wenzhen said. It didn't take long for the medical treatment to go through such a special test that gave this young doctor a deeper understanding of the emergency department. Some people are distressed by the hard work of the emergency person, but in the eyes of the young man, this is exactly the time when the emergency doctor should be the best. The medical care of the emergency department clearly felt that in mid -May, the emergency department was slowly recovering to normalization, and the workload was close to 80 % to 90 % before the epidemic. This week, with the comprehensive opening up of various specialist clinics and inspection and inspection items of Huashan Hospital, the pressure of emergency treatment was greatly reduced. Some medical staff began to ""go to study"" and carry out ""bubble management"". With the development of good development, there are also some unexpected helplessness -not so comfortable to go home for medical staff who can ""go reading"". When the ""epidemic"" line from home is the angel in the eyes of everyone, at this time, it has become the object that needs to be guarded. ""But who would think about taking the virus home? Medical staff is the best prevention, and they will go home if they know that they will be in place."" Chen Mingquan called for the angel in white in the front line. Citizens are requested to understand and take care of them. Chen Mingquan's own expert outpatient clinic has also been restored, and some patients wearing a protective clothing and face screen made him cry and laugh. ""COVID-19 virus is still spread through the respiratory tract. When you come to the hospital, we can wear the N95 mask. If you do n’t gather, you can do it well."" Chen Mingquan is also the chief physician of the infection department of Huashan Hospital.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/4.htm,5/20/22,4th Edition: Shanghai News,

Yesterday, the telecommunications officer Ji Jiahui played more than 50 passage for more than 50 links. For such calls, the other party is the elderly who will not be proficient in using smartphones. These young talcists use intimacy with the old people to pull their families, ask their needs, and help order dishes. In the past month, a total of more than 18,000 households lived alone, of which 1377 elderly people bought living materials by phone ordering. Behind this is a group of platforms and three parties to take care of the fragile and soft group under the epidemic. How can the three parties come in? ""There are no one to come, and many elderly people will not speak for help."" Chen Xingjie is responsible for the work of the digital partner promotion center at the Shanghai Smart City Development Research Institute. One of the daily work is to help the elderly integrate into a digital life. Although she has been in contact with many elderly people who use smartphones, she still feels that it is too difficult to let the elderly buy and grab vegetables with mobile phones, especially the elderly who are more than 80 years old. They are more and more silent away from digital life. But silence does not mean forgotten. Since April, Chen Xingjie has joined the special operation of ""Digital Partners Assisting the Old Purchase"". ""We need to screen out the oldest people who need to serve the fastest way, and provide services in their most acceptable way."" After many discussions, a digital guarantee platform that links the three -party power supply platform is established: Shanghai Electric Signal 100 Company Established an old -fashioned team composed of 30 people. According to the first batch of pilot street sorting out the list of elderly assistance, calling for needs; Carrefour, Darunfa, China Resources Wanjia and other guarantees for enterprises to provide package and special delivery; street residential residence The committee organized a volunteer team to complete the ""last 100 meters"" delivery home and collect the payment on behalf of the goods. When the specific implementation is implemented, there are many problems: how to communicate can make the elderly explain the needs; how to set the package variety and price; whether the cash payment used by the elderly is feasible; what to do if the volunteers come to the ""Yanglou"" at the door; Later, the supplies arrived again and again, how to solve it ... At first, the team had several ""recovery meetings"" every day, sorting out the ""blocking point"" in the process, and the variety of light packages discussed more than a dozen plans. The residents' payment of the elderly can use cash to order from the elderly to get materials, most of which are completed within 24 hours without more than 48 hours. Under the epidemic, how does this efficient circulation do? ""At first we wanted to develop a small program, but found that there were many links in the process of"" helping the old guarantee ""in real time, no matter which digital tools were used to solve the problem. To improve the efficiency, we built each street 2. In this WeChat group, large groups have relevant leaders and contact personnel from all parties, and they are settled to people; small groups are executives and are responsible for implementation. ""Chen Xingjie introduced that at 6 o'clock every night, the 114 phone team sorted out the order for one day and sent to the small to the small. Group; keep the delivery time and delivery time, the collection method, etc., and send the photos after the distribution time, the method of receiving the payment; after the departure, send the vehicle photos and road maps to the group, which is convenient for volunteers to master the supplies as soon as possible Delivery dynamics. In Beixinjing Street, the cadres and volunteers of the neighborhood committee formed the delivery team to set up receiving points at the entrance of each community to seamlessly connect with the guarantee enterprise. Equipped with full -time personnel to help the old -fashioned package to the elderly's house in time. Many elderly people have proposed to pay with cash. After the team communicated with the street neighborhood committee, it was determined that the neighborhood committee was paid in advance. If there is a return, the neighborhood committee coordinates the internal coordination to see if it can be transferred. On April 18th, the first call call was connected to help the elderly supply platform run under the help of the three parties. It has now covered 7 Cao Yang Xincun, Beixinjing, Pengpu Xincun, Linfen Road, Xinhua Road, etc. street. Inspired the demand communication plan for more than a dozen editions ""We have selected the Shanghai dialect, the backbone members who are patient and meticulous, and have a strong communication ability to join the elderly team. It can help the elderly. Cao Ling, the person in charge of the ""Calls Team, introduced how to make the elderly clearly express the needs, and the team summarized the more than a dozen edition communication plans. Ji Jiahui remembers that he called an old man in his 80s at a time. The other party said that no one had talked to him for a long time. ""The old man did not order materials, but I talked to me for a long time. I was like his grandfather who was like his grandfather. The old man felt particularly happy."" Many elderly people have poor listening power, and they are very laborious to communicate, especially involved in involving it involved The price of the set meal must be said repeatedly several times, Xiaoji is never annoying.

Space,COVID-19 suffers,Space,"Wu Shuang Xie is a friend when I was living in the United States that year. Now I have long been Xie. Their family has lived in the United States so far. Recently, Lao Xie's whole family experienced a battle of life and death, which was a life of nine deaths. what happened? The old Xie couple is from Shanghai. At that time, I wrote an article to describe the different habits of the southern people and the northerners. The prose of the comparison of the comparison was once a joke for many people. Essence I haven't seen them for a long time since I returned to China. The day before yesterday, when my husband and I called on WeChat, he told me the experience of Xie Xie, which scared my cold sweat. Lao Xie's mother -in -law lived from Shanghai more than 30 years ago to live in the United States and Lao Xie's family. For example, after ninetys this year, the body gradually weakened, the memory was decreased, the strength of the legs and feet decreased, and the visual perception ability also decreased. At the end of November last year, I fell at home during Thanksgiving, and my legs were fractured. As a result, life becomes very inconvenient and needs to be taken care of at any time. So after discussing, the old Xie and his wife decided to send her mother to a nursing home with good conditions. Who knows in the nursing home, mother-in-law infected Covid-19. Everyone knows that the chances of the elderly infected with COVID-19 are relatively high. They have poor resistance and are easily violated by viruses, not to mention an old man who get Alzheimer's disease. Mother -in -law is from Shanghai. She still can't speak English in the United States for many years. This is really troublesome. The symptoms of the elderly are getting more and more serious. After the fever, the old man's mind is almost lost. It is manifested as irritating and unreasonable. The behavior is disordered. The nursing staff did not understand what she said. People who need to feed on weekdays are needed, and at this time, the elderly who saw that they took care of her were not family members and refused to eat. She could not eat the Western -style simplified meal, so the situation was similar to the hunger strike. Incontinue and not toilet. The old man later developed to take off his clothes, tears the quilt, and threw things around the room ... The nursing staff could not take care of her at all, because she would be violently rejected by her. So one day, when the old thanked them went to visit the old man, they saw the tragic situation of the old man who had a scattered hair and was out of control and was urinating everywhere. The Lao Xie's family collapsed quickly. At this time, their daughters and old men's grandson stood up and played a role. This girl used to be my son's childhood playmate, and I still remember who he was fighting for the game with my son when he was a child. Later, she learned the care of nursing, and now she is already a skilled nurse. The granddaughter far away in California was anxious as soon as she heard her grandmother. She picked up the phone to talk to the managers of the nursing home with the professional language and asked them how they took care of the elderly. Immediately change the situation and go to the court to sue their deficiencies, even inaction. At the same time, she told her parents that her grandmother took home as soon as possible, otherwise the elderly would live! The old Xie couple went to the nursing home to pick up her mother -in -law back home according to her daughter's instructions. The old man's emotions were comforted, the living environment was improved, and the taste on his body was gone. But then the waves of unrest and waves rose again. First, the wife of Lao Xie was quickly infected, and the symptoms of COVID-19 appeared. After that, the young daughter said, and finally Lao Xie also had the phenomenon of sore throat, cough, and fever. The whole family had to go to the hospital for examination again. As a result, his wife and daughter were positive, and the old Xie was negative. Lao Xie also wondered, how did you have various COVID-19 symptoms, but it was negative? In any case, the whole family was infected within a day, but it was an experience that I had never experienced in this life! The most terrible at present in American hospitals is not that there are no medical methods, but the lack of nursing staff. It is almost impossible for hospitalization treatment. No one takes care of you. If you delay in the hospital, I am afraid that you will have experienced the experience of the old Xie mother -in -law in the nursing home? The hospital prescribed a bunch of drugs, took it home, and self -help the sleep. When they returned home, they were separated by each house. The burden of taking care of everyone can only fall on the old Xie who is temporarily determined as negative. Lao Xie endured the pain like the throat -cutting of the throat, and was tortured by high fever and dizzy. Extraordinary. Of course, I have to endure the torment of her temperament of her mother who always likes to be clean, and she cares for her mother -in -law. I think how many times I have experienced the difficult experience when I first arrived in the United States? Fortunately, after nearly two months, the whole family of their family healed slowly, the thrills passed, and the crisis was lifted. It seems that this COVID-19 virus has been gradually mastered by the most intelligent species in the world in the world in the world after more than three years. The most profound thing I realize is that if the mother -in -law's mother -in -law is an elderly person in the American family, it is likely to not be able to live to the present. Perhaps only Chinese talents who respect and respect the older generation will devote themselves to their own interests to protect the lives of the elderly. If it is an American, it is likely to leave the life of the elderly in the nursing home and protect the survival rate of other young members in the family. Chinese, for our own national pride. Old Xie, good!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/7.htm,5/20/22,No. 7 Edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space,Voice of Silence,Space,"In the early morning of Chen Su Puxi, her mother said in WeChat that it seemed too quiet. Yeah, looking at the balcony, the familiar communities are like a static material painting. The active figure in each window seems to be interpreting a silent film. A tree cherry blossom blooms, and there is a bit of loneliness in the rotten; the birds that have rushed across the vowial arcs, and the chromato chorus was particularly crisp. The ears in the silence are particularly keen, and the wind is slightly blown by the wind. In the past few days, various sounds in the quietness have been distinguished. Those who have a loud movement may be guaranteed supplies. The small sound may be the volunteer antigen reagent. If the sound is not loud but continuous, there are ten or nine nucleic acid detection. Sure enough, ""Dai Bai"" and volunteers were strictly waiting, and residents of the community were dispatched in batches. On the day of the city, the city measured nucleic acids. I paid attention to the ""Bai Bai"" bracket, and moved instantly. Because of this epidemic, these foreign medical staff assisted Shanghai and appeared in a strange community. We can only express their gratitude with gestures. In silence, the ""Ding Ding"" sound of the mobile phone WeChat, the WeChat group of the building group is comparable to the work group. When everyone is isolated in the door, the WeChat group has become an important link connecting people and the world. The neighbors who hurriedly nodded in the elevator, now they get along with their nicknames in the group, watching each other. Although my mother's community was only separated by a bowl of soup, the sealing control made the distance between the three or four hundred meters difficult to surpass. After entering the WeChat group of the mother building group, with the sound of ""Ding Ding"", I always saw the dynamics of the mother's community, which was quite sense. However, the entanglement of this wave of epidemic far exceeds everyone's expectations, and the refrigerator of every household has gradually gone. The ""Hundred Regiments War"" in the WeChat group quickly started, and the heads of vegetables, bread, milk and other groups showed their magical powers. The members of the group were connected to the dragon. The property staff sent a copy. The sound of ""crunching"" wheels in silence sounds particularly wonderful, and the tablet car that is dormant in the corner shows his hands. In the days when logistics were extremely difficult, group buying materials were usually more sudden in the middle of the night. Volunteers' night walking team moved quickly, eliminating disinfecting, rash goods, and separation. Open the door in the morning, and the items that are thoughtful are close to my eyes. The sound of unloading in the community is becoming more and more frequent, and a batch of supplies are sent to the house. Everyone has gradually realized the freedom from vegetables to meat and eggs. The sound of ""Ding Dong"" in the group is even more lively, and the neighbors of the hand are the results of showing homemade cakes, Xiaolongbao, and gongs, and the results of sharing flower pots and hydroponic vegetables. You will hear the sound that you never hear in the silence. Despite the careful screens for many days, there are still several residents in the building. Fortunately, there are no complaints and various comforts. The neighbors of the recruitment also frankly told the process to find out the process, and also sent a square cabin life photo. The building group under the epidemic became a community of destiny. An old man was uncomfortable, and the medical worker in the building immediately visited online; the second child mother was anxious because her husband was named in the company and took two children alone. I recommended her picture book video of our publisher; A question: Seek the principle of ""breaking the mirror"", and immediately a neighbor gave the ""molecular gravity and reprimal force"" textbook -level answer. Listen quietly in your heart. When our physical distance is separated, but the spiritual distance can be so close; how much distance between people to contact is appropriate, can the real contactless contact only be realized by artificial intelligence? Everyone who experienced this epidemic, the immune system of the soul has been tested, and re -examine what is the most cherished. Especially in the Z generation, who lived in the age of material abundance, I was used to moving the fingers and the rapid items. Everything was so easy. It was rare to experience how to use N -type dishes to match the cabbage and carrots. Taste every bite of food. The epidemic will eventually pass. When the restart keys start, the urban symphony will sound again, and everyone will return to normal life. However, in the spring of 2022, it is destined not to be forgotten. You will think of the green onion that Zeng Jingui sent by the neighbors at the door of the house, and you will remember that potatoes will also bloom strange flowers.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/8.htm,5/20/22,,

He suffered from severe severe depression and accompanied by intermittent heart disease. Essence After the seal control of the community, the condition continued to increase, and life became more embarrassed. There is no income, I can't return my hometown, and the rent information of the house is constantly sending ... ""I can't eat it every day, I can't sleep when I sleep!"" In a whispering cry, Mr. Zhou said, ""I lost all the medicines for treating the disease. I don't want to survive. ""It suddenly touched the hearts of reporters and countless netizens. Through many strikes, severe depression and life! Faced with a lively life, the ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" public welfare alliance once again launched the city's ""most urgent rescue"". Li Xiaohua, a national second -level psychological counselor at Shanghai Haitao Social Workers' Service, quickly intervened, and slowly found Mr. Zhou's ""Thousands of Hearts"" -Mr. Zhou, 32, rented himself alone. 135, Shenbei Road, Minhang District, has come to Shanghai for 10 years.

However, for the mother of Anhui's hometown and a 5 -year -old daughter, from the boss to the takeaway brother, he still established himself, running around day and night, using his own hard work to support his family. But the epidemic struck, the community was closed, and Mr. Zhou was pushed into the most dilemma of life at once.

Space,Fireworks on Earth,—— Interpret Wang Wei,"Generally speaking, in the form of literary forms, the style of the novel is heavier. It seems that this kind of genre is born. Poems and prose are higher, usually there are not many fireworks. The buds in the Southern Dynasties are a kind of poem. Although this art form is a category of poetry, it is considered to have a very heavy fireworks. This is determined by its origin: it originated from the people, and it is often generated and circulated and circulated on the tile of the wine house. Later, he entered the court and the government. In order to use the idle class, it was used in large quantities, and its entertainment was further covered. It can be seen that the origin of art form is indeed important. The novel is fate with folk stories, and finally evolved into a different texture: it has become an elegant style in some of the precious intellectuals, showing a strong poeticity, otherwise it is very vulgar in the hands of others. In fact, not only novels, but also poetry, such as gorgeous poetry, shoulders, poems, certain compensation and poems. It can be seen that it is not a fundamental method to use form and genre alone. It is also necessary to see the creator's life texture. From this, you can finally determine the style and device bureau of a artwork. ""Fireworks"" comes from life, grassroots and folks, not all of them. The ""Wind Poetry"" of the Book of Songs comes from the people. Only by understanding fireworks, anger, joy and excitement, can there be outstanding art creation. How many poems will be left if you really lose ""fireworks""? Wang Wei's main works are never fireworks. This is not only its artistic characteristics and irreplaceable superiority, that is, unique aesthetic character, but also the main reason for him to reach a higher artistic level. ""The right poem is probably no fireworks, so it should be sought outside the pen and ink."" Life is difficult, hard -working and angry, exist in the background of a person's life, settle down and feel strongly. Only in this way can their pouring be touching, and they will become the main force and backbone of all art. The value of Wang Wei's value is not that or not endlessly. In him or for the excellent artistic conception and talent, other effects are generated. Of course, Wang Weishi's superficial aesthetic quality is undeniable. This is particularly manifested in some of his masterpieces, and it is also loved by readers of all ages. Some good sentences really highlight the unforgettable and beautiful charm. Although there are not enough, they can only be excellent handwriting. They are crystals, symbols, and poets that the poet cannot disappear. Such a creation will always pop up our hearts. We cannot use Li Dushi's huge aesthetic pleasure to balance Wang Wei. Because this is not the same nature and standards. This is not a comparison of confusion and abandoning artistic value, because artistic standards do exist; so we say that Wang Wei's art can not be replaced nor the same day as Li Du. When an art loses fireworks, the price paid is huge. Because the essence of life is the twists and turns. Although Wang Wei's transcendence and Qingmei need to soothe the truth, the power inspired by this sober cognition seems to be even more urgent. Everyone needs to face their lives directly, the expansion and extension of these experiences, which is the higher value of all artists and thinkers. Self -cultivation, everything is safe, optimistic and accessible, is an enviable and longing state, and it will cause many similar practice; but what is the parcel in such a realm, how much pain has been replaced, and how much joy has been replaced. We don't know. It seems to be another beautiful and harmonious life, as if entering a painless surgery, but the surgery still has to continue. All surgery is cut, bleeding, and everything will be condensed in an invisible dream. After dreaming, everything is still not blank. It happened, and it would be another situation when subjective rational cognition recovered this gap when subjective rational cognition recovered this gap. When the crystallization of the soul, when poetry and text present this gap, where does it come from? From the report and memories? Does others still remember? The latter obviously cannot. Then this emptiness is really empty, and life is a bit wasteful and sad. As a poet and artist, Wang Wei rarely feels and interesting in all his works. This is very different from many poets in history and periods in the same period. Qu Yuan, Tao Yuanming, Li Bai, Du Fu, and later Han Yu, Bai Juyi, Du Mu, Li Shangyin, Ouyang Xiu, Su Dongpo, Lu You, Xin Qiji, etc. are very prominent and effort in the expression of the love of both sexes, including romantic rumors. Clear and quiet like Wang Wei, which is the same as the content of the poem. Although it cannot be said that literary and art must have the love of heterosexuality, it can be considered that all art expression is related to the evolution and transformation of this vitality. ""Wife does not marry, lived alone for thirty years."" (""New Tang Book Wang Wei Biography"") Wang Wei and his wife lived a short time. After his wife died, he was alone until he was old. This situation is rare. This may be related to its Buddhist quietly cultivating life, but as a person and a poet, it is so indifferent and lonely in terms of emotion, especially the severity in poetry, or how much unexpected. All this will inevitably affect poetic quality.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-21/7.htm,5/21/22,,
Space,"Xiaoman, Green Leaf becomes full of bangs",Space,"Han Kesheng was full, the eighth solar terms. The second solar terms in summer. ""Man"", ""Said the Words"" interpreted as ""Ying Yao"", which means that the water is full. Later, it extended, not just water. ""Huang Si Niang's Flower Flowers"", ""Shan Rain wants to come to the wind and full building"", ""dusty gray fireworks"", ""spring color cannot be closed"" ... extending various symbolic and abstract full full. There are also two interpretations of ""Xiaoman"", one interpretation as water, because there are many rainfall, and rivers are full. Another explanation, grains and other grains began to grout. ""Monthly Seventy -two Top Set"" said, ""Things are full of size"", which refers to various fruits, not just wheat. Although it is still in Meng Xia, the spring has no trace. Everything is just ""small Man"", not ""Da Man"". However, in the twenty -four solar terms, there was no ""full"" at all. In contrast, there is a small summer in the solar terms, and there is a hot summer; when there is Xiaoxue, there is heavy snow; when there is a small cold, there is a cold. There is only a small man, no big Man. why? The reason is that the Chinese are full of vigilance with ""full"". Many familiar concepts are related to this, such as: the middle of the day is moving, the moon is losing; The ear heard the cocoon. In the life, drink six minutes drunk, eat seven full meals -everything must be just right, don't be too ""full"". Each solar term is divided into three. Xiao Man first, ""bitter vegetable show"". Bitter cuisine is a frequent visitor in ancient poems. The poet Wang Zhiwang of the Song Dynasty said: ""The index finger moves, and bitter vegetables enter the spring disk."" It can be seen that it has been in people's recipes since ancient times. In the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong also had such verses: ""Go up the mountain to use bitter dishes, and the blue and green is not full of baskets."" Bitter dishes belong to the family of chrysanthemums, and the bitter vegetables have a little bit of chrysanthemum. When I was a kid, I watched a movie ""Bitter Various Flowers"". The theme song was the classic of that era. I can still think of that melody so far. Writer Wu Boxiao said: ""The memory of the touching singing is long -term."" In the second time Xiaoman, ""the grass died."" Wucao, a slender and weak grass with the wind. ""Impact"" means falling down with the wind, such as ""popular"" and ""invincible"". The ancients believed that all things should move from time to time. This kind of grass ""felt yin"", and when the yang was strong, it would wither and die. ""The wildfire is endless, the spring breeze is blowing again."" The so -called ""life in life, the grass and trees are one autumn"", the affection of nature is reflected in its ruthlessness. In the third time, ""Mai Qiuzhi"", the wheat matured. ""Autumn"" is ""Hutter Cooked"", which means mature. Many poets of the Song Dynasty wrote ""wheat, green green barley yellow"". I don't know who is the copyright. Now rice is the first main food, and the northeast is known for its high -quality rice. But in history, Mai is the protagonist of the Yellow River Basin. ""In April, the south wind barley yellow, the jujube flowers have not fallen into the long leaves"", the small full solar terms, the most timely when the yellow and yellow are not connected. Fortunately, barley harvested. The barley harvest and rice containment are almost synchronized. When the poets appreciated ""April Fang Fei and the peach blossoms in the mountains are in full bloom"", the peasants ushered in a busy season: ""There are few idlers in the village in April. . ""Compared to touching singing, hunger's memory is more unforgettable. From the beginning of the notes, every time the solar terms, the belly is empty, and it is dissatisfied at all. Crying to eat, letting me only four years old is helpless. Fortunately, everything has passed, and the whole people have well -off. Experts have formulated many standards for well -off, and many standards have put annual income first. In my opinion, the first criterion is not money, but not worried about eating anytime, anywhere. The word ""full"", ""full"" is more important than ""warm"". The Tang Dynasty poet Lu Yan described the shepherd in an envious tone: ""After returning to a full meal, he does not take off his clothes and moonlight."" This Lu Yan is not an ordinary person. He also has a more widely known name: Lu Dongbin, yes, Lu Dongbin, one of the ""Eight Immortals"", and a master of Taoism.

Since the end of March, Chen Wenwei, who was 69 years old and was the secretary of the Organization of the residential District Party, was busy and supported in different communities. Zhongning Community is a relatively large community with a large area, which means that there will be many difficulties in closed -loop management.

Under such circumstances, ""Old Secretary"" Chen Wenwei sank into the community to support apprentices. Next, whether it is organizing residents to make nucleic acids, or a series of trivial and important things in communities such as government gift packages, she takes the lead and has no absence.

Space,Mr. Peide in my mind,Space,"Fang Weiping lived in Cambridge two years ago and met the epidemic. Most of the original exchanges and wandering plans in various places were scrapped. However, during the blockade, you can also live at home with peace of mind and write something. As a result, I read the three major volumes of ""Shu Peide's Selection"", including ""Practicing and Watch"", ""Perseverance and Excellence"", ""Fate and Responsibility"", and published in September 2019. This is the selection of nearly 20 types of literary theory and prose concentration published by Mr. Peid over the years. The earliest name ""Shu Peide"" was in the newspaper. Around the mid -1980s, I first entered the field of children's literature. That was also the first hesitation of children's literature in the new period and began to enter the stage of passion and art. I often see the name ""Shu Peide"" from related literary reports, especially in news about children's literature. I saw it a lot. I found that the name was always associated with important resolutions and deployments in the development of children's literature, and associated with certain institutional arrangements, design and important activities of children's literature at that time. For example, in May 1986, the National Children's Literature Creation Conference jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture and Culture in Yantai, Mr. Peide gave an opening speech; in January 1987, the ""Literature and Art Review"" was released, and Mr. Peide published Publishing the ""Window · Bridge · Nursery -Expectation of Children's Literature Reviews"" special editions; the first national National Outstanding Children's Literature Award in 1987, Mr. Peide is the deputy chairman of the jury. In October 1988, at the ""Children's Literature Development Trend Symposium"" held in Yantai, I first met Mr. Peid. At the meeting, he presided over his speech and controlled the overall weightlifting. At the opening ceremony, the keynote speeches of ""closer to the big era and closer to the small readers"", vision and generalization, thoughts and guidance are impressive. In November 1992, the preliminary evaluation of the second National Outstanding Children's Literature Award in the China Writing Association was carried out in Beijing. I participated in the event as a member of the primary group. I remember that the preliminary evaluation was hosted by Hong Bo and Mr. Fa Jia. Mr. Peid was the director of the jury, and there was no specific work during the initial evaluation stage. We have been closed for nearly a month at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Welfare Institute. One day, in the rest, Mr. Peid suddenly asked me: ""Who do you want to see in Beijing?"" Seeing me confused, he added, ""Is there an old writer I want to see?"" I was very surprised, ""Can you? ""In children's literature and historical research, of course I hope to have the opportunity to see my predecessors. This is not only a professional experience, but also a way we establish a certain connection with history. Speaking of the old predecessors in the children's literature world, what I want to see most is Mr. Bing Xin, Mr. Yan Wenjing. ""I'll help you arrange."" Mr. Peid said. My accident at the time was obvious. I know that the two gentlemen are old and have a simple life. Although Mr. Peid has contacted in the middle of contact, I still feel deeply disturbed. Especially Mr. Bing Xin is 92 years old, and I usually see the news of her elderly people receiving visitors. Under hesitation, I was afraid of adding too much trouble to Mr. Peid. I said, ""If it is convenient, I want to meet Mr. Yan Wenjing."" Later, under the arrangement of Mr. Peid's contact, I asked a friend who participated in the initial evaluation work together to visit Mr. Wenjing on Sunday afternoon. After graduating from Fudan University in his youth, Mr. Peid entered the work of the Chinese Writers Association. He experienced the ups and downs of the contemporary literary world. An elder who is full of wind and frost is so careful and thought about the desire of a junior. This incident has always been a specific and vivid details that support my personal understanding and interpret Mr. Peid's character and literature. Mr. Peid has repeatedly said in private and text that he has the opportunity to shout for the development of contemporary children's literature, but he knows that he has nothing to build in children's literary creation and theoretical research, and it is not appropriate to occupy this position. He expressed his self -confidence: ""There is no general in Shu, Liao Hua pioneer"", ""with my interest and enthusiasm for children's literature, he also reluctantly ran up the dragon cover and knocking on the drums."" In fact, since 1985, Fan, the secretary of the leadership of children's literature as a secretary of the Writers Association, has been in charge of the leadership of children's literature for more than 20 years. The boundary is obvious to all. An important identity of Mr. Peid is the influential critics present from the 1950s to the present. Due to the job and identity, some of his articles are written in the form of conference speeches, summary, etc. The text will inevitably have some meaning and conventional language that must be expressed. Therefore, sometimes we inevitably or have the ""document body"" picky and picky and picky and discerning and discerning. Evaluation. However, reading a large number of children's literature research and review articles written by Mr. Peid in the past 70 years, I deeply feel that he still revealed that he has revealed the pure literary mind and comment as a critic under the requirements of the job role and the role of the job role. vision. He wrote and published in 1957, ""Where does interest come from?"" —— Talking about Keyan's Children's Poems ""has become the classic chapter left to us that children's literary and artistic thinking are thin. Even his later speeches and summary articles, read carefully, have a keen and unique observation and thinking. For example, at the 1988 Yantai ""Symposium on Children's Literature Development Trends"" mentioned earlier, his keynote speeches were specifically proposed that ""examining the current situation and development trend of children's literature must be placed in my country In the background of society. ""In my memory, the influence of children's literary circles noticed that the development and publishing of the commodity economy on the creation and publishing of children's literature is what happened after the early 1990s. It should be said that Mr. Peid is a critic who put forward this perspective and topic in the children's literature community earlier. He has published articles such as ""Thinking about Children's Literature Innovation"", ""The Main Melody and Others of Children's Literature"", and ""New Landscape Trends"" and other articles have all had a wide range of influence in the children's literature community. In December 2021, at the tenth National Congress of the China Writers Association, Mr. Peid was also seen. Mr. Peide, 90, is the oldest representative of the conference. The media's attention and interviews have also become a meeting. During the meeting, I met him more from newspapers and self -media. I know that from the Second Congress of the National Association of Cultural Association (predecessor of the Chinese Writers Association) in 1953 as the secretary of the presidium of the conference, and later, as the representative of the conference, Mr. Peide also became a historian of Chinese contemporary literature including children's literature.

The name ""Shu Peide"" shows us a literary elder and a child literary guardian Gao Jie and indifferent character and literary ethics.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/7.htm,5/22/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,
Space,Wang Xifeng's two appearances,Space,"Luo Yuming's ""Dream of Red Mansions"" attaches great importance to writing characters. Through such a link, the author pushed the artistic image he carefully shaped to the stage, allowing them to show their distinctive personality characteristics, just like a piece of music with a special melody, which made people unforgettable. Wang Xifeng is a particularly important figure in ""Dream of Red Mansions"". Some people have counted that her story is second only to Jia Baoyu in the entire novel, and exceeds Lin Daiyu and Xue Baozhen. The author may be very satisfied with his creation. He asked Wang Xifeng to do two similar ""appearances"" on different occasions to show different levels of his personality. The first time was when Lin Daiyu first entered Jiafu. Daiyu met with his grandmother Jia Laojun. After a while, after passing, Jia's mother's house restored the original atmosphere, and no one dared to speak casually. In this quiet field, a loud voice came in from the back room: ""I'm late, I never welcomed Yuanke!"" The book then used Daiyu's reaction to explain that the matter was extraordinary. "" All of these people have a screep, respectfully, who is the coming, so the birthday is rude? ""This plot is like the"" screaming ""in Peking opera. Then it is ""appearance"", and the characters are displayed. The book describes this layer by layer, rendering layer by layer. First, ""I saw a group of daughter -in -law surrounded by a person and came in from the back door."" This shows that the comer is important. Wang Xifeng is the man in charge of the Rongguo Mansion. She must always instruct her to do things at any time, so there is no one around her. Then the chief said her dress, saying that ""the sisters are different: the colorful embroidery is brilliant, like the fairy of the concubine."" In the scene of the star arches, the woman who set out the gods. Then write her costume, probably, the material is extremely expensive, the color is very delicate, the production is very particular, and the beautiful and luxurious is extremely luxurious. Then write the appearance: a pair of Danfeng triangle eyes, two curved willow leaves hanging eyebrows. Dan Feng's eyes, the corners of the eyes were slightly raised, and it was particularly beautiful in the minds of the Chinese people; but slightly showing the triangle, the lines were a bit hard, still beautiful, but just reduced softness. Willow -leaf eyebrows, like willow leaves, are not too much curved, with thin eyebrows, and they are also particularly beautiful eyebrows in the minds of the Chinese people. The hanging tips mean that the eyebrows are flying upwards, so the fierce taste will show when staring frowning. Then write the body body: the body is slim, the physique is coquettish. ""Slimming"" is easy to understand, and ""physical coquettish"" is more subtle. You can imagine that there is a seductive vitality exuding this wonderful body action. In modern words, it is sexy. Then write the expression: The noodles are not revealed by Chunwei, and Dan lips are not laughing. The beautiful face is fascinating, but there is a kind of power hidden in it; although it is ""not revealed"", you can feel that you can feel good without attacking; but she always tries to express kindness. Without speaking, you first hear laughter. The exposed smile, the sharpness hidden inside. This beauty is vitality and expansion. However, Jiafu's rules are strict. In Mother Jia, Mrs. Xing and Mrs. Wang are also cautious. How dare Wang Xifeng? If you think about it a little, you will understand: This person is loved by Jia's mother and is indulged by Jia's mother. So why did she get special treatment here? Look down at us. I saw Wang Xifeng ""carrying Daiyu's hand, and forgive it up and down, and still sent it to Mother Jia to sit down."" She pulled Dai Yuli near herself, just one or two steps, why should she ""send it to the mother of Jia""? This is the consideration of consideration, thoughtful and careful! Then Wang Xifeng laughed: ""There is really such a Peugeot in the world, and I have seen it today. Besides, the style of this body is not like the granddaughter's daughter of the old ancestor. . ""This is exquisite, please everyone. Lin Daiyu is the granddaughter. This ""foreign"" makes her an outsider of Jiafu, but Daiyu came to Jiafu according to the will of the old lady. He said that Daiyu was ""the granddaughter of his relatives"", indicating that in Wang Xifeng's eyes, Daiyu had the same status as the three ladies of Jiafu. Of course, this is the heart of Jiajia's heart. From Lin Daiyu, even if she doesn't think this is the glory, from such a word, she can feel the love of her grandmother. She will not be disgusted. The three girls in Jiafu will think that the granddaughter is excellent and will be like a granddaughter. It can be seen that the granddaughter is higher than the granddaughter after all, and she is naturally happy. So I knew Wang Xifeng. She is beautiful, publicized, and she is particularly well -behaved and clever. Besides the second ""appearance"". When Liu Xun first entered the Rongguo government, the maid Zhou Rui's family took her to see Wang Xifeng. After entering the room, I saw that there was a big red felt under the south window, and the big red felt on the pupa was covered with golden and green satin large mattresses. Sister Feng was sitting there, her clothes were casual and gorgeous. At this time, Wang Xifeng's big girl Ping'er stood on the edge of the puppet, holding a small lacquer tea tray. There is a small cover in the plate. Sister Feng does not pick up tea, nor does she look up. What? Holding a pair of small copper chopsticks in his hand in the gray in the dial furnace. It is the kind of small bronze furnace used to warm hands. She just turned the gray in the furnace, so she drew it slowly, and she was quiet around. The previous time Wang Xifeng had not arrived, and the laughter spoke first, but now it is the opposite. For a long time, she didn't say anything, and others didn't dare to speak. The relationship between the surrounding characters is different, and Wang Xifeng's mood has also changed. However, if you think she deliberately waves in front of Liu Ye, it is not right. Is it worth it? She just likes this atmosphere, enjoying a pleasure in this majestic. Almost that, Wang Xifeng slowly asked: ""Why don't you come in yet?"" It seemed that she hadn't seen anyone in. At this time, she raised her tea and asked Zhou Rui's family to stand underground. As a result, his face suddenly changed, and he asked hello with a spring breeze. Why are you polite again? Because she is a lady, she is very particular about courtesy. As for changing his face, Wang Xifeng said that he changed, and there was no time. Just to Liu Ye, Sister Feng's words of talking is not diminished at all. I saw her laugh: ""Relatives don't walk much, they are alienated. You know, say that you abandon us and refuse to come often; the little man who doesn't know is like no one in our eyes ""That means that the two sides are not communicating, the responsibility is you and not us. Liu Xie came to ""fight the autumn wind"" as a poor relative, and Wang Xifeng knew that he had to help a little. But she has to take precautions in advance. She told me that Jiafu ""watching the fierce bang outside outside, I don't know if there are big and difficult places."" This means that we are not good for us. Then the words turned: ""Today, you are coming far away, and for the first time to see me open your mouth, how can you ask you to go back empty?"" The meaning in this remarks, you will open to me for the first time, you can never let it You return empty -handed, but the second time it may not be. How much can I help? Wang Xifeng said that her girl -in -law's twenty -two silver had not moved. ""I haven't moved yet. You don't think you have too little, so I will take it for the time being."" This means that we have no extra money, so we have to disassemble the East Wall to make up your west wall first. The second ""appearance"", we saw another important component in Wang Xifeng's character: like to get right and like to see people nervous under their own pressure. She is still dexterous, but this dexterous value for poor relatives like Liu Ye has more self -appreciation. After two ""appearances"", Wang Xifeng's tone of personality and character has been very clear in our minds, and we will not mix with anyone else.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/8.htm,5/22/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup,

Later, I lived in a friend's house for a while, and finally rented a house where several friends and family members were located, and moved to this place. No see. The daughter's school also closed and went to the station to pick her up. Three people get along. Fortunately, there is a large terrace in this house. There are three large food supermarkets on the side of the road downstairs. On the side of the subway, there is a Claper land. Ambulance screaming, even at night. I can see the person who grabbing food in front of the supermarket door, and I can see in front of the window. When I saw people, I rushed downstairs to buy food. Because it is a rental house, there is only one desk, for my daughter, the table for the table for the table, I want to buy a desk, but the furniture shop is closed, and when I find that the ironing board can be used as a desk, I put it in front of the window. I write, see the ambulance passed, and look at the masks of the two -meter queuing, more than a day. Every day our family goes to the park eight kilometers. The people in the park are all out of wind and exercise. They often see that children sit in the sun and hold a book to read. There are also police cars patrolling on the side. Two meters separately.

When working at the training center of Bailian Group, No. 325, South Suzhou Road, I opened the window every day to visit the Suzhou River, disappeared from the paddle lights of the folk ship, to professional ships to treat river channels, digging mud, oxygen, salvaging water gourd and reconstruction of flood prevention walls. I witnessed the black and smelly river water gradually becoming clear. On the Dragon Boat Festival, the Dragon Boat of the Suzhou River started. The grand collective wedding ceremony also chose to be held in the river. The elderly in their 90s did not believe that the smelly river was like such happy events. The Suzhou River is a beautiful daughter born in the beautiful Taihu Lake, and is a ""pretty woman"" from Jiangnan Water Village. In the past, the black and smelly years, which had been unbearable, was too dedicated. Later, the government spent tens of billions of ""plastic surgery"". I think it is worth it because she is the mother of our Shanghai people. Today, the most beautiful bridge on the Suzhou River is the dilapidated and narrow Wuning Road Bridge. After the reconstruction, the golden ""mother and child"" sculpture on the huge bridge column symbolizes the ""blood"" relationship between the Suzhou River and our Shanghai people. I like to ride a bicycle to see the Suzhou River. The 42 -kilometer -long river must be visited in sections in order to make a charm. From the Linkong Park of the outer ring line, it has played the Baidu Bridge, and Huangpu, Hongkou, Jing'an, Putuo, and Changning areas are fully connected. 6.3 kilometers of Jing'an section is too like a natural catwalk. The ""Modern Flower Street"" along the coast is unique, as well as a beautiful ""Golden Avenue"". Let the mother's river feel colorful.

The exquisite paintings showed the quiet life scene and urban style of the Jing'an from 1921 to 2021. I worked at No. 88 Huqiu Road, and I rode through the bridge for seven or eight years. I didn't expect that the dark space can be transformed so delicate, probably the ""back room"" specifically decorated for the mother river. The ""Eye of Su River"" in Huangpu section is a watery ""long eyelashes and big eyes"". It is a new platform that transforms a new water and water. The 3 kilometers long river bank can experience the immersive waterfront city life scene. I especially like the Yuanmingyuan Road of ""Bund Source"".

The Hongkou section of North Suzhou Road emerged from the Hongkou section of Beisu. In the warm sun, I leisurely sat and drank coffee, and the familiar old place turned around to be trendy world. I think that the Shanghai Building did not hesitate to transform the window at that time, that is, I was afraid that the smell of the Suzhou River rushed into the guest room. Entering the ""Most Shanghai Observation Platform"" that was converted from the original parking lot, overlooking the invincible scenery of the Lujiazui Skyline, which made me feel so much, it seemed to have a beautiful ""Phoenix Crown"", which happened to ""wear"" the Suzhou River On the head. 40 years ago, I went to work on Shibu Road Bridge every day. There was only a lonely ship signal pole on the Lujiazui of Pudong. The most exciting thing is that in the eighteenth Bay of Suhe, she is too like the sleeves in the Peking Opera suit. She dumped it so softly, shaking out of elegance and beauty, and how many people who fascinated her. Of course, the Suzhou River also has a new dress when she is dressed. The 21 -kilometer Putuo section looks like ""long legs"", and the 11.2 -kilometer Changning section seems to be a modern ""boot"" on his feet. It is bright enough to set foot on the yacht pier on the Dadu River Bridge. The mother of the mother in the night was overflowing with the galaxy.

Space,Fairy Tale,Space,"Mei Zihan, I have been reading Andersen's fairy tales. It is my perennial book. The best Chinese version is placed on the table. The green color cover, the thin 16 books are stacked into a very infinite height. This height is not seen by the eyes, but often turns through the reading room, and gradually comes out and measures in my heart. It is indeed decades. It was bought by my first grade when I was in college. At that time, this set of books was just published. It was the same as the publication of other classic literature. Ecstasy rushed in to buy. After ten years of disorderly spending, no book reading, the sentences have been stiff, and I miss literature and miss fairy tales. That night, Zi Ming, who lived on the opposite bedroom, came over and asked me softly, ""Do you want Andersen's fairy tales?"" I said, ""Yes!"" He said, ""I will bring you next week. I bought a few sets, I know the manager. ""From the second week, when I returned to school every Sunday evening, he brought me a book. There were 16 books in total, and he brought almost six weeks. The last one is ""Lucky Belle"". When I got the last book, I felt a little like lucky Belle, and finally I was all, rest assured. The price is six pieces and five cents. The banknotes at that time were really valuable and dignified. When I counted the money to pay him, he said, ""It's hard to buy, I know the manager!"" When I thank him, he said, ""I know you will like it!"" He bought it and sold it to it again. I, he also read it. After reading one book, I got it, and I got one by one, and the method was strange. I went to school with paid, and he issued subsidies in the school. My salary is 33 yuan. Farm educated youths can be paid by college. The first paragraph of ""Lucky Belle"" writes a beautiful house. The owner is very rich. He can put two barrels of gold in the living room, or put a barrel of gold coins at the door of the room as the future savings of his son. This set of fairy tales has since become the gold and gold coins in my life, and put it on the table. The green cover is printed with the name of Andersen, and Ye Junjian's name is also printed. They are two names at my table every day. They are close at hand and see it for decades. I see it every day, a brilliant, a dazzling. Write with Andersen's writing, which can be this: ""In the past, there was a person who could write. In addition to his pens and paper on his table, there were two people's names. In the past, one is later. As for this person's own name, it is written in his own book. This principle, I already know from when he did not start writing a book, this is a glorious truth. But his book It is never possible to be greater than this one, but he still works hard, because at least he can put them next to the great book, beside the great book, and will be shot by light. There is a light in my book! 'Even if no one wants to read his book, he will tell himself. This is also the meaning of living. Living must have a meaning. ""In China, Ye Junjian's name is He Andersen. The most named name, he translated Andersen's fairy tales like Andersen, and Denmark thought so, and awarded him award. Just like Balzak's novels in China, Fu Lei must appear next to his name. If not, then the enthusiasm for reading will be low. Literary translator is a person who allows you to understand another language. If he is very outstanding, it is not just about telling about the approximate stories and meanings. The two languages are held on one rein, and they are all in the hands. Literature is a perfect art, and he must be beautiful everywhere. Endlessly, so lingering is inseparable. It is a clear piece of your heart, or it wets you. It is unclear whether it is because the original text is written by an adult or the translator of the current text. Anyway In the text. The people used to write with pens. The pen was also their respective reins. Holding Malaysia in their hearts, in the one, Anderson and Balzak both used goose brushes. Balzak's novels are too thick, and Andersen's fairy tales are not thick but unlimited. Reading them are not to find the guidelines and secrets of making a fortune, whether reality, romance, are all for people's eyes and hearts ... people live in ordinary people. Strolling in the air, can be close to it, hold it up, put down the side, it will not be much meaningful, at least there will be tranquility, poetic longing, and being willing to get along with the time. Don't do bad things ... This is not a description in literary and artistic, and I am not in the class of art. ""Daughter of the Sea"" is also written to people's eyes and hearts. For those who want to be people. It is a poem -like fairy tale, and Ye Junjian translated into a fairy tale poem. The small fish in the deep sea feels noble, want to be a person, find a way to achieve, but the result is difficult to guarantee. The law of living is alive in countless people, but Xiaoyu declined to let another life die for life. She tossed the knife and was willing to turn into a foam. Is she really a bubble? She clearly became a real person! Where is she? Please look at the countless people with legs, and those who have lived out of her personality are her! Such people have not been many, so it takes a long time to evolve. Putting and reading close at hand is the meaning of evolution. The bronze statue of Andersen leaned on by standing. I have been there in Balzak's home, and I have seen that little desk. Standing at the classmate's window, I saw the window of Mr. Fu Lei's house. That's all. But Mr. Ye Junjian I have seen it. I was at the seaside twice and participated in the same meeting. The first time, I walked on the road and suddenly saw him walking in front. I am embarrassed to surpass and slow down. I want to find a stationery shop to buy a book. He is also looking for a stationery store. After finding it, I only found it, and I went in. He asked the clerk if there was a pen's pen's pen. He bought one, it seemed like a dime, right? Then he left. A few years later, at another seaside, I took a photo with him. I talked to him about the last walk and talked about the core of the pen that he bought. He said, ""That stationery store is not close, and I have gone for a long time."" I also talked about the green cover book. He said, ""It was published in 1978."" I said, ""I put it on the table every day."" He is tall, full of wisdom, clear eyes, mild smile, and handsome! Now think about it, I still admire it. When a young childhood, he stood by his hometown of his hometown and practiced his singing throat. Someone told him that there was an ancient country in the east. There was a very beautiful prince there, and he must hear his singing. When he did hear it, he translated his songs into a book that ancient countries also loved. The literary talents were particularly young and elegant, and they were full of childish and funny. He translated too well! He walked a very close way, and seriously bought a one -piece pen's core -too ordinary reins, and I was in the back of his back. My fairy tale is also written.

Space,Mountain Flowers,Space,"Zhou Huacheng ""The flowers on the mountain are almost blooming, when will you come again?"" Xiaoya sent WeChat, and the heavily flower shadow attached to the rhododendron -some red, some lighter purple, mixed in the Spring Mountains of Ruhai, like clouds It looks like a brocade, like Xixia like waves, and pure white flowers like a veil, and spread out lonely in the mountains. Xiaoye is a tour guide of the fairy house. When I went last time, it was still winter. When I entered the mountains, the mountains and the clouds were lingering, as if entering the wonderland. The situation is by no means on earth. When the ""Sky"" in the southern sky, suddenly the clouds were foggy, and the stone walls were all overwhelmed. Above the cliff, Guanyin Peak suddenly appeared. At that moment, hundreds of meters under the feet were still the sea of clouds. Guanyin Peak seemed to grow from the sea of clouds. Only for a while, the clouds of the sea gathered again, covering the mountain peaks in front of them, as if the layers of veil, as if the peak in front of me had never been opened in the world. The wonderful clouds like that are extremely shocking. I met at that time -to go to the fairy residence again. Go to see it when it is sunny, and go to see it when it rains. Thinking about it is a different scenery. Winter snow scene wants to see it, and the red leaves in late autumn also want to see it. At four o'clock, there are four o'clock. Soon after this meeting, the epidemic was repeated. For a while, it was inconvenient to travel here. I will minimize the flow in order not to add trouble. When the fairy is snowing, the mountains are wrapped in silver, which is really a wonderful scene, and they can only look at the circle of Xiaoye's WeChat circle of friends, and cannot reach the mountains. In the spring, I gradually woke up, and I also wanted to travel, but there was a situation of helplessness. Xiaoye often shares some beautiful scenery in the circle of friends. For example, the deep mountains in February are open with laughter, and the cuckoo in March is in full bloom. Starting from February, the deep mountains laughed in the green forest, which was particularly conspicuous. Xiaoye said that the flowers in the mountains are probably not particularly dazzling, but if you sit down, you will find many sporadic wild flowers. Here, there are clusters, some of them are unknown. People are surprised. The rhododendrons in March were planted by the staff of the scenic spot. The lilac is around the boardwalk; there are some wild ones on the distant cliffs. In May, there is also wild lilies that will open as scheduled in the mountains. The yellow wild lily grows between the cliffs, or next to the Liuquan Waterfall. Sometimes walking on the boardwalk, if you don't be careful, you can't find it. That kind of wild lily, in the cracks of the cliffs of thousands of crickets, suddenly grow up in a place where the soil is almost impossible to see the soil, suddenly a branch of proud flowers. At this time, if you see it, you will definitely lament the tenacity of vitality. Recently, due to the epidemic, the tourist team of the fairy house has been much less, and only sporadic passengers go up the mountain. Xiaoye still often goes up the mountain, and her colleagues still walk, work, and climb in the mountains every day. They are still in the circle of friends. In my own life, if I can't come to this mountain, I will share the beauty of the mountain with you. The fairy residence is the remaining pulse of the second peak of Cangshan. There are countless natural giant Buddhas standing on the mountain, and there are countless legends that have been unclear for thousands of years. I remembered that I stayed in the fairy house last time and knew some entrepreneurial stories of the fairy house. In the 1990s, the county was established in the county, where there were cliffs, waterfall flowing spring, dense jungle, and birds and beasts. The deep girlfriend did not know. Many staff members are not afraid of hardships, climbing the vines, climbing all the gaps and routines, and gradually opened up the path of pangolin piercing, and barely walking calmly, barely to do the tourism career. In the past two or three decades, the beauty of the fairy residence has been presented little by little. The harmony between man and nature, the artistic conception of man and heaven and earth, is gradually recognized and spread, and the popularity of the fairy residence has also been pushed up. At that time, everyone admired a Mr. Zhu, saying that he loved the mountains most. There was no one who had never walked in the gap in the mountain; the grass and trees in the mountains had never been visited. It is also with them that this beautiful scenery -however, Mr. Zhu repeatedly waved his hand and said, ""Shan is comfortable, comfortable, and the beauty of the landscape is there. In the mountains, Caol, how dare to plunder the beauty of the mountain. In spring, unknowingly, the fairy is rich. I thought to see it with Mr. Zhu, and they would climb the mountain where the fairy residence was climbed with Xiaoye. It is good to see Yunshan Misty Sea, or to see flowers and plants, all of which make me yearn for. There is also a ""depth of Luo Luo"" in the mountains, which originated from Ni Yan, ""Mosshuma seal the elk diameter, Baiyun Xinjinluo clothes"". This artistic conception is really good. He wrote to the painter friend Zhang Yu, I also want to visit the depths of Luo Luo. Guo Xi, a painter in the Song Dynasty, said: ""There are three fars in the mountains, and the top of the mountain is high from the bottom of the mountain. , Far -up overlapping, the meaning of Pingyuan is rushing and stubborn ... ""Three far away, the fairy houses are all, spring mountains are like the sea, thousands of cliffs are green, layers of mountains, and the flowers that gradually wake up, They are waiting for guests. Matsumi cooks, I want to be couples with you, friends elk, between the mountains and waters, sitting together for a drink. In this mountain, I know that it is coming vigorously. The leaflets send a message, saying that the wild lily buds in the cliffs are heavy, and the flowering period is coming. When the sun comes out, the epidemic will be dispersed like the clouds and mist in this mountain. On the day of the sunny day, the flowers of the mountains will be opened, and the flowers will welcome you in the fairy house together.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/8.htm,5/24/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup,

Space,"Teacher Qin Yi, who is the child of children",Space,"Qin Wenjun's eleventh ""National Children's Story of Children's Story"" in August 2010 was held in Yuhang, Hangzhou, and the organizer wanted to invite Teacher Qin Yi because Teacher Qin Yi has always cared about the healthy growth of young people. The organizer called and contacted Teacher Qin Yi, but her August event was full and missed the competition. The organizer also expected this situation. Teacher Qin Yi was too busy, not to mention that at that time, the 89 -year -old age was hot and the journey was hot and the journey was far away. Essence Teacher Qin Yi listened with great interest, and learned that the activity of this story competition can not only enrich the children's amateur life, promote the boom of storytelling of children across the country, but also to exercise and improve the eloquence of children, so that many children have more confidence from now on Essence So she said, ""I participated in the event that it was beneficial to the growth of children. Teacher Qin Yi's daughter Jin Feiyi took a business car and went to the venue from Shanghai. The entire 3 -hour drive, the weather is hot, the temperature has soared to 39 degrees Celsius, and the air conditioner of the business car is slightly insufficient. The road conditions are also very unsatisfactory, and they are bumpy all the way. Everyone is baked by the big sun outside the car. Finally arrived at the hotel. I was worried that the 89 -year -old teacher Qin Yi was tired enough. It was suggested that the organizer arranged for her to rest for a while. I did not expect that Mr. Qin Yi shook his head again and again. Regardless of the tiredness, he was put in the preparation of the award meeting and had no rest at all. At dinner, the enthusiastic organizer prepared a delicious meal for the guests. Teacher Qin Yi sat at the round table, but hurriedly ate a few sips of silk noodles and half a bowl of mushroom soup. Well, I ran away and worked at my intention. Teacher Qin Yi was humble and was very serious in work. He wrote a speech in person, and repeatedly confirmed whether the activities and names in the speech were correct with the organizer. The guests who attended the award meeting with Mr. Qin Yi, in addition to me, also Gao Yanming, the writer Ye Xin, was the director of the Central Youth Department of the League in a timely manner. Everyone admires Teacher Qin Yi and surrounds her, seeing her no celebrities at all. Seeing her so dedicated and rigorous, everyone not only admires her, but also feels her affinity. She also likes her very much. Energy is more vigorous than us. At the award party, we were surrounded by enthusiastic winners. Gao Yanming said that he was paying attention to Teacher Qin Yi very seriously at the request of each child, and signed them one by one. Some children want to sign on the head of the paper, some want to sign on the book, and some want to sign on the award certificate. Teacher Qin Yi is happy and talks with the children to answer them all kinds of naive and fun on the performance. Question. Unexpectedly, just signed half of the signature. As soon as a boy handed it to his book, the teacher's teacher greeted the collection, and he left anxiously. Teacher Qin Yi held a pen in his hands, and he stood up from his seat with a regretful face, his eyes pursuing the boy in the crowd, and kept talking to himself: ""It's not finished yet, it's really not right ..."" At that moment, at that moment, She seems to be an old grandma next door to her grandchildren. After the event, Mr. Qin Yi rushed back to Shanghai overnight, because the next day she had to participate in another public welfare event. It happened that I had something to rush back to Shanghai. Shanghai, Mr. Qin Yi talked about life and movies along the way, and also talked about children's literature. She said: ""Actually, I also had a dream of writers when I was young. I wrote interesting and writing for children and children. Teacher Qin Yi's mother and daughter went back and forth in Shanghai and Yu Hang. On the way, I heard that Mr. Qin Yi would laugh at himself. But such a long -distance labor, the frequency of high -intensity public welfare activities, the 89 -year -old teacher Qin Yi seems to be very adaptable, and is accustomed to it, which makes me relieved, but I feel distressed and do not go. After a lapse of two years, the award party of the twelfth story king competition, Teacher Qin Yi was in the field and could not attend, but she cared about this competition and asked the organizer to hold the event. The event must be insisted on it. ""Teacher Qin Yi donated savings for the charity, and silently devoted himself to countless efforts for public welfare activities. For many years, she did do this. She can see her figure in public welfare activities and hear her sincere voice. It is valuable. She sprinkled her kind, love, and beautiful feelings to the world and dedicated to the lovely generation.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-25/6.htm,5/25/22,6th edition: Nights Cup,
Space,Peacock opened the screen,Space,"Zhang Huimin went downstairs to do nucleic acid, and the detection point was facing the peacock garden in the community. The queuing team was winding, and I followed all the way, but my eyes locked the peacock in the cage. I still remember that when the house was watching the house, the sales lady attracted customers on the stone path of Ququ, and suddenly saw 4 peacocks pace and peck in the grass leisurely. I watched it, the peacock and the green land are so harmonious. Isn't this a realistic picture of man and nature? The lady of the sales building obviously understood our minds. She said that the peacock is very sensitive to air quality. The peacock in the community is used to monitor the environment. Whether this is a gimmick that year, I am willing to believe it. Can developers care about the ecological environment of the owner's living, where can the management level go? These peacocks immediately decided to settle home here ... A few days ago, some people in the WeChat group in the community said that the peacock was ""yang"", and it immediately attracted discussions. To be honest, the peacock is the common ""pet"" of the owners, and their destiny naturally affects people's hearts. I remembered that I ran to see the peacock after moving, and I found that 4 peacocks became 3. The guard told me that when they discovered the peacock, they looked around. They were determined that they were stolen until they saw peacock hair and bones in a bunch of construction garbage. It was the peak of the decoration of the community at that time. This reminds me of my heart. I can't imagine that someone can face the face without changing the color when it is laborious to pull the gorgeous peacock! After that, I paid special attention to the fate of the three males and a female three peacocks, and I often visited them when walking. I don't know if the peacock's little head remembers my figure. Anyway, one day, the male peacock suddenly opened the screen, just like a large green fan with a metallic luster moved in front of me elegantly. At that moment I was intoxicated. However, the good times did not last long. The two male peacock partners died. The two seemed to lose their souls, and even the brilliant tail gradually fell like a bald. At that time, the estrus period of animals, they called day and night, and their sounds were astringent, bright and high. I did not expect that the sound of beautiful peacocks was so unbearable. In the 8 buildings in our community, everyone's dreams were disrupted. Noise comes from time to time. One day when I went home, I found that the elevator was posted by the elevator. This method is good, what can people in the community have? What difficulties cannot be resolved? Sure enough, some residents solved the difficulties for them ... Just when they went downstairs to make elevators such as nucleic acids, they happened to meet the cleaners of the property on our floor. I asked his peacock's ""Yang"" is true or false? He said with a smile, they were not as sun, but we went to the ""square cabin"" for a week. There are 8 people in the property ""Yang"". The residents of the community know that it is even more terrible that our building has also exposed more than 20 positive patients. It was a dark moment, everyone was in danger in the building, and no one accepted the garbage, and the group was anxious! At this moment, the secretary of the neighborhood committee stood out, and the volunteers who were still insisted on picked up the battle to solve the urgent need. Although I can't see the hardships of moving the garbage layer by layer, there will be pictures in front of my eyes. But the property master still brought a bad news. The original three peacocks were killed by a wild dog, and now there are only two male and female. I asked the master why he couldn't put the peacock freely on the grass? He waved his hand again and again, saying that it was because the peacock would fly. In this very important period, it would be difficult for them to fly to other communities. Suddenly, I found that the male peacock started the bright and dazzling destination. Wow, it actually opened the screen in the cage. Is it because after more than this month of sealing and control, I saw many neighbors? Is it because the lady of the sales building said that the peacock had the function of monitoring the environment, and it smelled the romance of Xia Zhuan dance. With a serious face, the corners of our mouths rose involuntarily, and took out their mobile phones and took a picture of the consolation that brought us the comfort. This is the warmth of human and animals that infiltrate the heart field.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-25/7.htm,5/25/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,

One night after the investigation, the practical data of the so -called ""14 -melon farmers 290 acres of Nanhui 8424 watermelon cannot be sold"" in Changchun Village, Pudong New District, ""6 saued farmers 93 acres of more than 90,000 kg of"" tail vine melon ""may be slow!

Yesterday, the Xinmin Evening News ""Battle Epidemic · Gang Nong Hu"" urgently ask for help in the hotline live broadcast, the ""selling melon model"" is opened! In the sip of the reporter's ""everyone buying melon together"", more than 90,000 pounds of watermelon has ""bottom -up sales guarantee""! Farmers cannot waste their efforts in the live broadcast. Yesterday morning, Li Yonghang, deputy director of the Comprehensive Development Division of the Pudong New District Agricultural and Rural Commission of Changchun Village, Xuanqiao Town yesterday morning, said that there are 14 mourning farmers in the village to plant nearly 300 acres of watermelon. A total of more than 280,000 pounds of watermelon that can be sold in watermelon. At present, there are 6 households with more than 93 acres of watermelon. There is a huge difference in numbers, which is likely to calculate the number of nearly 300 acres of two crops throughout the year. ""These melons are not the highest quality Nanhui 8424 melon, it is"" tail vine melon '. ""Li Yonghang said that these watermelons were shipped by retailers to nearby roadside and parks in the past. Transportation vehicles are affected. ""But every melon is the hard work, gain and hope of farmers, and must not let them rot in the ground!"" Li Yonghang told reporters that after receiving the help, the district agricultural committee and Xuanqiao town have quickly contacted the Vietnam Asian farmers' professional cooperatives , Jinhua Bay Farmer Professional Cooperative, etc., is currently receiving acquisitions with farmers. Is the transportation sold well this year, is there any slowdown in the epidemic? Shi Lei, a professional cooperative in Shanghai Tian, said: ""No! Our watermelon here is sold ..."" The Daguan Town where he is located is one of the largest producing areas of 8424 watermelon. This year, due to the full light and high temperature, the first stubble watermelon has grown up, and the harvest has increased compared to previous years. Although the epidemic is blocked by the acquisition and transportation, the Grand Town Government immediately established the fruit and vegetable groups and vegetable groups for farmers, and passed the docking with Lianhua Supermarket, Ding Dong, and Hema Xiansheng, a subsidiary of Bailian Group. Being capable in time, let each melon be freshly sent to the community in Shanghai. ""When the epidemic has passed, these fruits and vegetable groups that have helped Ala farmers must keep it."" Shi Lei was grateful. The reporter also sought a number of melon farmers such as the academy town, Nanhui New Town, etc., and the feedback was almost consistent: ""The transport vehicle can come in, and the watermelon is available in the watermelon. The melon is not only sold well, but the purchase price is higher than in previous years!"" Selling at a parity, is the 8424 watermelon this year ""difficult to find a melon"" due to distribution problems? "" Is there a price increase because of ""strange goods can live""? Wang Jiamin, the person in charge of Fresh Purchase of Lianhua Supermarkets under the Bailian Group, introduced that during the epidemic, Lianhua Supermarket opened the ""green channel"" for farmers and citizens. Not only is watermelon, melon and vegetables are the same. ""This year's watermelon has not only acquired a few hundred tons in previous years, but also increased the purchase price."" Wang Jiamin said that through online sales and offline delivery, Lianhua Lianhua said, Lianhua The supermarket has always guaranteed the affordable supply of citizens' ""vegetable baskets"". ""Many stores have been opened now, and the affordable 'buying and buying' is more convenient."" Wang Jiamin told reporters that the price of 8424 watermelon in previous years was slightly higher than other melon species. A vine can only be sowed by a melon. Only the land that had been planted in rice last year and did not plant watermelon within five years. Therefore, the investment cost of farmers is still very high, but this year's market price is basically the same as that of previous years. ""Yesterday, yesterday."" In the afternoon, Tiantou in Changchun Village, Xuanqiao Town was drizzle. ""Car loading! Get off!"" A truck full of watermelon departs, and more than 90,000 pounds of watermelon was sold.

What changes have brought back to the hospital's emergency response to Omikon?,Shirt details Detailed risk upgrade Hardware defense before,Space,"With the prevalence of the epidemic prevention and control, the outpatient emergency department of Shencheng Hospital has resumed. How to do a good job of prevention and control of the hospital while ensuring the daily operation of medical institutions? In the past two months, in this ""encounter"" with the mutant plant with Omircor, everyone realized that the prevention and control strategy for Omikon must not stay two years ago. The reporter observed that the hospital may start to reduce the risk of infection from details, or upgrade the hardware to prevent problems, and launch a series of new response. In accurate research and judgment to strengthen the ventilation of the ventilation, medical treatment such as outpatient consultation and surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University has never stopped. Data show that in the past two months, the number of emergency daily visits of the hospital exceeded 1,000 times, an increase of 42.85%over weekdays; ambulances have been visited by more than 100 units a few times a day, an increase of 68.33%from weekdays. The channels for medical treatment have remained unblocked, and a series of comprehensive measures taken in sensory control have played practical results. According to Hu Bijie, director of the Department of Infection and Hospital Infection Management Department of Zhongshan Hospital, the Zhongshan Hospital uses COVID-19 nucleic acid CT value to accurately study infected people and its infectiousness, and quickly transport patients. ""Theoretically, every time the CT value is reduced by 1, it means that the virus load of the infected person is doubled."" Hu Bijie said, ""At the same time, it depends on what stage of the infected person is, is it the onset stage or the restoration stage?"" Said that if nucleic acid positive CT value is about 40 and obtains the report form for hours after the sampling, it has been wearing masks during the sample, then the infection of the infected person is very small, and the circle of the densely connect can be very small to avoid unnecessary medical personnel unnecessary. ""Non -combatant reduction"". After accurate research and judgment, isolation and disinfection must be fast. ""To deal with Omikon, we must take fast, and within a few hours, the entire prevention and control measures are implemented in place."" Hu Bijie explained that for the nucleic acid positive in the ward, you can move immediately. Immediately move it out; if you cannot transfer it outside the hospital, you will arrange to the negative pressure single ward, at least leave the original non -isolation ward. Hu Bijie also believes that at this stage, it is most important to emphasize the indoor air ventilation of medical places. This is because for Omikon, if there is no good ventilation, if there are infected people indoors, there will be a large number of virus -containing air -soluble gums into the air, and there is a huge risk. In the emergency rescue hall and emergency liquid tonic room, Zhongshan Hospital replaced the large glass of multiple windows with high -power row fans, and several mobile air disinfection machines were added. In addition, the hospital also added the use of hydrochloride atomization methods for air and objective disinfection. Under the prevention and control of emergency equipment, how to ensure the rescue of patients with severe critical illness, but also to do a good job of isolation screening of COVID-19 suspected cases? The option given by the First Affiliated Hospital of the Naval Medical University (Shanghai Changhai Hospital) is: portable negative pressure ward. ""Portable negative pressure ward is a multi -functional emergency equipment. It can be completed in only 10 minutes. It can also be"" transformed 'in a short time according to the needs of patients. It can also be transformed into a temporary hemodialysis room, temporary delivery room, temporary rescue room, etc. ""Professor Wang Luowei of the Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, told reporters,"" Its built -in fresh air system can filter polluted air to clean air, and the filtration rate reaches more than 99.99%. ""5 On the 14th, the 80 -year -old A -year -old Mu Kong was sent to the emergency department of Changhai Hospital for unstable walking with nausea and vomiting. Due to the relevant symptoms of COVID-19 virus infection, the hospital emergency department for the first time was used to treat her for the first time, and it was converted into a stroke rescue room in just 2 minutes. After the doctor entered, he gave the ECG monitoring and detection of life signs, and adjusted the treatment plan according to the changes in the condition. At the same time, the results of Kong Grandma's nucleic acid were confirmed to be positive. After the elderly had a smooth condition to meet the transshipment standard, she was transferred to a designated hospital for follow -up treatment. Since it was put into use in May, the portable negative pressure ward has completed emergency isolation and treatment of more than 40 patients with critical condition at Changhai Hospital in Shanghai. In order to minimize the risk of preventing and controlling the epidemic prevention and control of the inpatient ward, the Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College has refined the overall layout of the various departments of the Department of Surgery Building in the Department of Medicine of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Each building has a buffer floor. The hospital explained that patients with emergency treatment but not yet meet the conditions for admission will first come to the unique interval of the buffer floor. Patients who need emergency surgery will perform personnel protection and negative pressure operating room surgery in accordance with the hospital sensing requirements.

"The ticket could not be grabbed, and the wife could not return to Kunshan to take the order again after surgery, and set off for the ""car god"" who returned to Guangxi's father to return home","""Back, everything will be better""",Space,"""We are back, everything will be good ..."" Gently took out his wife from Buick business car. The 59 -year -old Mr. Yuan walked steadily to the disease control transshipment car, then bowed his waist, then bowed his waist, and then bowed his waist. Carefully and slowly put her on the seat. ""Tears and tears, my eyes are wet."" ""May my aunt recover soon, I hope that a lover will stay for a lifetime"" -Thorium, this short step, this warm hug instantly moved the netizens guarded online. No matter how hard and tired, she couldn't get tired of her a few days ago, and in the New Min Evening News ""Battle Epidemic · Gang Nong"" emergency hotline live broadcast, the phone came from the phone, and Mr. Yuan cried helplessly. On March 14, he accompanied his wife with chest tumors to rush from Kunshan, Jiangsu to Shanghai. He was treated in the East Hospital of Renji Hospital affiliated to the Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College in Pudong New District. After receiving the notice of discharge, although Mr. Yuan was exhausted, he could not grab the high -speed rail ticket, and the temporary hotel could not find it. ""My wife had just performed surgery, and the doctor said that she must rush home early and lie down. Now she can't even stand on the station. We will have no relatives and have nowhere to get out of the hospital. Don't be tired! ""Mr. Yuan's deep affection for his wife, warming everyone who heard the call. The reporter quickly sent information to the ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" public welfare alliance, and Shanghai Yuwan Industrial Development Co., Ltd. once again took the task of ""mission"". At 11 noon yesterday, after being trapped in more than 1,700 kilometers, he transported Guangxi's father and escorted Anhui father more than 600 kilometers overnight. After the desire of the last moment of their lives, the Buick business car of ""Yuwan Industry"" set off again. The car arrived at the Eastern Hospital of Renji Hospital, and the ""escorting the two groups"" Zheng Zhou and Wang Chun helped Mr. Yuan's wife into the car.

Emergency transfer live broadcast ""online guardianship"" again. Make more work, so that she would not save it anymore. Mr. Yuan's wife closed her eyes and lying weakly in a chair weakly. Holding his wife's hand tightly, Mr. Yuan's eyes had never left her for a moment, even if a gently cough would attract a nervous concern. Mr. Yuan has always had a deep self -blame for his wife's illness: ""I have always worked with zero workers, but I have not earned much, but it is particularly hard. For this family, she saves money. When I went to the hospital, I blamed that I didn't take care of her, and I dragged this serious illness ... ""In the days of treatment in Shanghai, Mr. Yuan tried everything. ""Fortunately, this destiny was rescued, but this was a big operation. People hurt their vitality and suffered a lot. I hope she will raise it after returning. It will be fine ...

When holding her husband's neck was hugged into the transshipment car, the corner of the wife's eyes flashed. Liely leaning on the seat, facing the live lens, she raised her arms hard, waved hard, and ""thank you"" with a weak loud sound.

Space,Miss Huang Shuqin Director,Space,"Tong Ruixin got up early in the morning and turned to the circle of friends and saw the news of director Huang Shuqin's death. Another good director left us, and another Shanghai Film iconic filmmaker went. Director Huang stayed in the hospital for many years. Today, Director Huang Shuqin went to the world we did not know when everyone was finally going to. Before filming ""Shanghai Vicenstery"", I made a lot of films in Shanghai, but there were not many mainstream dramas. A ""Shanghai Victor"" has made Director Huang Shuqin establish a deep friendship. The basis of friendship is mutual trust from our cooperation. After the cooperation of this half a year, we have established a deep friendship. ""Shanghai Vice"" is a key play in the city that year, and it has mobilized the excellent main creative team. I used to shoot a Qing drama in Changying before, and the entrance group was relatively late, and the head was scratching. As soon as I entered the ""Shanghai Vicening"" crew, I needed to use the hoods of different eras during the trial. The teachers all showed difficulty. Director Huang Shuqin was very decisive, and everyone present told everyone present that this role (Tang Eupu) was determined to invite Xun Ruixin to perform. This was my first impression of Director Huang Shuqin. It made me feel that she was a person with her own point of view and insisted on her opinion. She would never shake because of the swaying vision of the people around. Therefore, once the AB group was unpredictable, the actor shouted ""Please Huang Dao"". As soon as Huang Dao arrived, the problem was resolved, and the argument and hesitation disappeared. I think this is the first step for actors and directors to build trust. With this step, we have our later mutual trust and our profound friendship. The Tang Mi -Pu played in ""Shanghai Vice"" needs to be performed from a teenager to a hundred years old. That is to say, the century -old life process of this character reflects the century -old vicissitudes of Shanghai. I think Director Huang Shuqin asked me to perform a understanding and investigation before Tang Miura, so she decided decisively that Tang Liupu, who was from the age of teens to 80 years old, was completed by me. Duan, he invited Liu Qiong, an older generation of artists. I remember that when the filming was taken halfway, one day, Director Huang Shuqin suddenly found me. She said that the shooting intensity is relatively strong now. I am afraid that Teacher Liu Qiong, who is already old, can't bear it. Can you do it alone from 80 and 100 years old? At that time, I was surprised, and I also had an impulse to complete the shape of a centenarian character, but then I told her that this will leave a big regret. Many of us look forward to the appearance of Teacher Liu Qiong in this play. I thank you. Huang Dao's trust in me, but I look forward to completing a role with Teacher Liu Qiong, which is of different meaning for me. Director Huang finally changed her thoughts. In short, in the six -year shooting of ""Shanghai Vicensum"", the cooperation and conversation of one or two times, even because of a long -lens discussion, finally let us deepen understanding and formed a deep friendship. Later, the TV station broadcast ""Shanghai Vicenstery"", and the ratings were very good. One day, I received a call from Director Huang Shuqin. Director Huang said that Mr. Li Jiayao of the Shanghai Youth Troupe watched the TV series and talked about me. The core is why Tang Sangpu of ""Shanghai Vicensum"" was sorted on the subtitles. He put forward his own views. In fact, for me, it is more important to get the recognition of elders, peers and audiences like Teacher Li. I said, ask him not to wait in my heart. After speaking, Director Huang Shuqin didn't speak for a long time, and for a while, she said, ""This is something that should not happen, I will ask them tomorrow."" Later, I heard that it really changed. I think because of Huang Dao must face a lot of pressure. I am very lucky to have such a good teacher and friendly friends around me. They are happy to see the growth of young people. They treat young filmmakers frankly and protect all the way. They exist like lighthouses! The following year I went to Beijing to participate in the shooting of the TV series ""The Gate of the House"". I saw the old classmates of Director Huang and Guo Baochang, the director of my good teacher and friend. I remember that Director Guo Baochang told me at the time that ""Shanghai vicissitudes"" was a good show, which is Shanghai's """" Da Zhai Gate. Later, I learned that Director Huang Shuqin and I lived very close. Once I received a call from her, ""What are you doing? Are you watching a child? You have a script to give it to you."" I push it At that time, she was a baby daughter. When she met Director Huang on the road, the script she gave me was a script she had prepared for a long time, and she hoped that the actor I played was very contrast with the role I had shaped before. I said at the time that I couldn't play such a role, and the director Huang at this time, just like when I first met her in the ""Shanghai Vicenstery"" crew, she said very firmly and confidently: ""You can play, and you You should play it well, you should challenge it. ""Later, this"" Siege Continued ""was not made for various reasons, leaving regrets. On June 18, 2013, I got the address of the Jiading Nursing Home where Huang Shuqin lived in, and Xia Jing and Yan Xiaopu visited her together. Huang Dao's room was placed in many books. The caregiver said that Director Huang liked to read books and rarely talked to people. After seeing Director Huang, I was a little sad and found that Director Huang gradually reacted to the surrounding things slowly, and even had the situation of not knowing people, but she still remembered me. She said you always laughed, and he was happy to see you. Xia Jing took a picture for us. Later, we also went to the cafeteria of the nursing home to eat bowl noodles. Director Huang called on Mr. Zhang Ying, the predecessor of the drama group who lived there. Talk, take a walk. Once again, it was June 11, 2014. At the Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai, the director Huang Shuqin almost didn't know people at this time, but she also met her old classmates. That day, Director Guo Baochang, the classmate of her film school, also bought a bouquet of flowers, but after seeing the old classmate, Director Guo Baochang had a bad mood and was very sad. After leaving the hospital It's too big! ""Because of Omikon, the entire Shanghai lost too much. I stood on the balcony, looked up, and the sky in the distance was shrouded in the fog in the distance. I think for me, not just a good director who lost, but the person who lost was a person who trusted me and encouraged me! When people reach middle age, life is usually a lot. Of course, the characters I like can be shaped, and I do n’t regret it. What I care about is that I lost a good good teacher and friend. Those who believe in, this loss is unparalleled! Miss you!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/7.htm,5/26/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,
Space,Experience the valuableness of happiness,Space,"Chen Mei's online teaching and research activities made me feel deeply. Although the network is not powerful, the speaker's voice is interrupted, and the dozens of PPT real -materials dry goods are really amazing. Seriously, these days, the mood is quite quiet, and I always feel that there are high walls around on all sides. It is happy to do things in the way you like quietly and quietly, but you want you to do this. You must achieve A and serve B, and you cannot neglect C. For example, you have to listen to a lecture that is not related to you, you have to fill in a meaningless form, you have to write a formalist report according to the template, you have to upload a photo of a vigorous job. Participate in a dispensable meeting, you have to ... sometimes make you lack of skills. You suddenly feel that you are very important, as if everyone can't do without you. No, you have to put down half of the courseware, and the homework that has not been changed, and go online to participate in teaching and research. From indifferent hearts, to a little interesting, until it is very reasonable, and finally the amazing five -body investment. The teacher was not young, and once lost his eyes because of excessive eyes. In the school, he serves as the teaching tasks of two classes, and approves the homework of nearly 100 students every day. I am surprised to eat her old flowers. Today, she wants to do a theme exchange sharing. How much time does dozen pages of courseware takes for information, and then classify, refine, summarize, summarize, and make courseware. At the end, she said sorry to everyone. At first, she forgot to open the microphone, let everyone watch the ""mime"" for a few minutes, and then from scratch to waste everyone's time. For 80 minutes, at the end, she was panting. What kind of tenacity and diligence is that! What I shared later is a job designed by young teachers -watching videos, making film reviews, and writing screenwriters. In a real context, guide students to screen information, sort out expressions, aesthetic creation, learn boring classical Chinese, and be interested in the taste. In full, it fits the current hot word ""literacy goal"". We also saw a less neat work, which was done by a boy in the bed in the square hospital. Somehow, the clear screen in front of my eyes was blurred, and my eyes were full of hot liquid. For a long time, a stuffed thing was stuffed with something, and a gap was suddenly bumped and flowed out. It was like slowly clearing the wind, and the haze in front of my eyes was brushed away; just like a trickle, moisturizing my dry heart field. These sharing make the sullen heart comfortable, the spirit of sleepy is excited, and the narrow mind is wide. Main reminiscent: Lao Fu Fu, aspirations in thousands of miles! Makes people: poor and strong, not falling in the blue clouds! It reminishes the words of Lu Xun's ""A Tips"": I suddenly felt a strange feeling at this time, and felt that he was full of dust. And he gradually became a kind of compression for me, and even the ""small"" hidden under the robe. My ""vitality"" was a bit stagnant at this time, sitting without moving. It wasn't until the host announced that the meeting was over that I stood up. Daka Ma said by the mouth of the Earl of Christ: There is no such thing as happiness in the world, and it doesn't matter. There is only one kind of situation and the other situation. Only those who have been holding wooden boards in the sea experience the wind and rain can we realize how valuable happiness is. Enjoy the happiness of life, keep in mind forever, before the heavens unveiled the future of human beings, the wisdom of human beings is included in two words: waiting and hope. Yes, everyone's life has many restrictions and unsatisfactory. We may not be able to control what happened, but we can control our emotions and mentality. When we take the initiative to choose our own way of thinking, we get the initiative of life to ourselves. Actively and positive interpretation of the people around us and things on our body will definitely receive positive feedback from positive and positive life. If we can give ourselves a chance to think and deal with it before we make a decision, give ourselves more patience. Think about everything in everything, life may have less regrets. Just like now, the house can also have the opportunity to learn. Every day, it is very happy.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/8.htm,5/26/22,8th edition: Nightlight Cup,

Space,"How to break through the ""difficult"" job seasons?","University Secretary Live Bring ""People"" and ""One Life"" Precision Counseling","In the sunny days, the teachers and students left at East China Normal University planted another season of graduation flowers -cold -resistant and drought -resistant potato flowers that can be rooted in flowers everywhere are selected this year. In previous years, in May, the ""Golden Three Silver Four"" was the end of the employment work of major universities. In this extremely extraordinary period, the employment of fresh graduates was still in the stage of tackling. Teachers who are responsible for employment in Shencheng have revealed that under the impact of the epidemic, college students have more stable mentality when applying for job hunting, and the school is actively guiding graduates to try to ""take root"" that can ""bloom"" soil. The latest data overlay in the posts of small positions show that a total of 227,000 graduates of Shanghai college this year, an increase of 20,000 over last year. As of May 6, the graduation goal implementation rate was 36.47%, which was 10.03 percentage points higher than the same period in 2020, but compared 6.54 percentage points in the same period last year. Chen Qun, deputy mayor of Shanghai, frankly said at the press conference of the epidemic prevention and control: ""The employment of college graduates is facing great pressure."" ""The epidemic has caused some imbalances in supply and demand of the employment market."" Deputy Director Zhang Yuehui analyzed that from a market perspective, some enterprises have suspended production or reduce production capacity, while reducing the investment in human resources. In addition, the company's expectations for future expectations have also changed, and their willingness to expand production capacity is not strong. In addition, due to the needs of the epidemic prevention and control, the Shencheng University has entered a state of closed management or quasi -closed management since March -offline job fairs cancel, and students cannot go to enterprise internships. ""The method of online communication limits the effectiveness of the employer's potential evaluation of the students."" Zhang Yuehui admits, ""Some companies believe that in addition to business capabilities, the degree of tacit understanding of the team is also important. . ""The epidemic also has a subtle effect on the willingness of graduates to apply for job hunting. ""The main force of college graduates is the post -00s. In the past, we investigated and developed that their value pursuit is diverse. In addition to salary and professional counterparts, we will also consider the balance between work and life, focusing on personal emotions and values. ""Zhang Yuehui told reporters that in the past two years, graduates have tended to be conservative, and the willingness to postgraduate entrance examinations, examinations, and state -owned enterprises has increased significantly. Some graduates, ""Don't want me, don't want me, I don't want small companies"", which has become the reason why employment is difficult to develop smoothly. According to other colleges and universities responsible for employment, some graduates have already reached their intentions with the enterprise, but due to the epidemic, the prospects of the ""holding hands"" of the two sides have become blurred, which has also caused anxiety to spread among students. Multiple effects exceeded the expected two years, and the live broadcast is very hot. Live broadcasts can bring goods or sell agricultural products. Can you bring ""people""? In this year's employment season, Shencheng University began to try to live broadcast. The unique form made eyeballs, not only participating in enterprises exceeded school expectations, but also the effect is equally happy. ""This is a very good student. He has a strong comprehensive ability and is very stamina ..."" As early as March 30, Wang Hongzhou, secretary of the Party Committee of Shanghai Ocean University, took 20 graduates to appear in the live broadcast room. Through B Station and Douyin The video number is promoted to the enterprise. Such live broadcasts have been conducted more than ten games by May. The new form of ""people"" live broadcast was originally the school's ""no way"". ""From last winter to the beginning of the spring, we were visiting the company. Now that we have reached the critical period of signing interviews, we can't wait to unblock it before doing work."" Wang Hongzhou said, ""It is unexpected that we are unexpectedly broadcasting in the later period, and the corporate personnel department began to grab the corporate personnel department. People are people, and even other companies in the audience group directly send the intention to sign the contract. ""Sun Honggang, director of the school's student employment and entrepreneurial service center, revealed that before the live broadcast, the school formed 12 research reports and connected to docking. Many companies have identified the employment market of 15 class graduates, covering 755 units. ""According to the survey, we plan to launch the second stage of live broadcast, inviting enterprises in a targeted manner, so that this series of live broadcast promotion is more focused and the personnel of the job are higher."" At East China University of Technology, the School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering 2018 level 2018 Gu Yijiang, a undergraduate counselor, has recently been busy for the future of 264 graduates -some students are not satisfactory to the initial test score of the postgraduate entrance examination and are going to give up. Gu Yijiang took their transcripts, reviewed and sorted out information such as admission scores and re -examination requirements of target colleges in previous years, and communicated with students one by one. He pushed the adjustment information of relevant universities to eligible students and instructed them to prepare for the re -examination targeted. In the end, nine students in the college were successfully adjusted, accounting for about 1/3 of the total number of admission to the grade. Earlier, the Ministry of Education also launched a special action of ""visiting enterprises to expand employment"". Under this opportunity, Shanghai Foreign Language University actively excavates job information that matches graduates, and has opened multiple air job fairs in the discipline. From March to mid -May, a total of 17 air -China job fairs have been organized to provide more than 6,000 positions; a total of more than 26,000 employment internship recruitment information of more than 26,000 households provides more than 77,000 positions. ""The school opens up a number of independent 'interview rooms' in the student dormitory building and the teaching building. It is equipped with online interview equipment to provide real -time technical service support to ensure the needs of the student line for interviews."" The reporter learned that Shanghai is currently working hard to promote the employment of fresh graduates: first, to introduce various policy positions, corporate tax reduction and exemption, social security subsidy policies, and encourage enterprises to hire fresh graduates; second, strengthen online recruitment and job fundraising Organize the graduation online recruitment fair and last until the end of August; the third is to optimize the employment and settlement policy of graduates. The first batch of settlements will be opened after the epidemic is stable and accepted until the end of August. The second batch will be opened by the end of 2022. It is difficult to tackle Sun Honggang, the director of the Student Employment and Entrepreneurship Service Center of Shanghai Ocean University. In the direction, the students in the postgraduate entrance examination also completed the interview one after another, and May was a harvest season. ""This year, a considerable number of graduates' job search is stagnant, and the promotion of employment is still in the 'tackling period'."" Sun Honggang said. In an interview, the school's principal of the school revealed that the school was actively guiding and encouraging graduates to go to the grassroots. In 2021, 541 graduates in the school went to the central and western regions to work in the central and western regions, glowing and heat on the vast land of the central and western regions. Shanghai Jiaotong University has long strengthened the ideological leadership and professional training of students during the school, and accurately transported more outstanding students to the most needed for the motherland and the people. It is reported that this year, the employment agreements of the graduates of Shanghai university graduates No. 0000001-0000100 signing students are from Shanghai Jiaotong University, all of which have participated in national key industry units. At present, for graduates who have not yet clearly clarified the future, Shencheng University adopts accurate exclusive touches, ""one file in a lifetime"", classified guidance, and formulates a precise assistance plan according to various key groups such as academic difficulties, postgraduate entrance examinations, and weak job search capabilities. And make full use of the resources inside and outside the school to provide students with special training camps, individual consultation, resume guidance, etc. It is reported that the Shanghai State -owned Assets System is focusing on promoting the employment of fresh graduates of colleges and universities: cities and district state -owned enterprises, especially in Shanghai enterprises, will arrange employment positions in the annual recruitment plan, which will be arranged for not less than 50%of employment positions. Graduate recruitment; Shanghai Communist Youth League helps to resume work and re -production ""Thousands of Universities and Wangang · Employment."" From the perspective of the teachers of the employment guidance center of many universities, such experiences are a kind of experience. It is also a valuable lesson in the first door to the society. At the same time, in addition to the government and enterprises, To help, students need to really move — only by many parties to go together can they break through. From a school perspective, the ""difficult and difficult"" job search season also brings a lot of thinking and experience. ""This year, we organized a photo of the graduates who had photography among the students in the school; invited senior HR lecture industry development prospects and corporate requirements for talents; Improve.

With pain, she continued to push the car to help the car and send the supplies to the door of the residents' house. Back at the neighborhood committee, she picked up her mobile phone to consult ""Angel White"", and continued to work after using the medicine. During the sealing period, it was difficult for residents to have a problem that needed to be solved for a time. In order to clear this block, the General Branch of Xiangyuanlizu District Party Party and Volunteer Drug Terminal held a meeting of the Red Council several times. Ni Xiaoqian fully communicated and repeatedly communicated with the team members. The distribution process to form a full -chain closed -loop management mechanism for the distribution of drugs, which greatly improves the efficiency of the distribution. From the initial 4 people, the phenomenon team expanded to 15 people now, and more than 600 distribution medicines were completed. Careful Ni Xiaoqian found that there are not a few volunteers with medical backgrounds in the community, and there are many residents who have the needs of medical treatment for medical treatment. Then why not build a list of problems and demand lists, and build an Internet consultation platform. After repeated discussions with volunteers, Ni Xiaoqian gathered nearly 70 medical qualifications in the community and opened a ""WeChat Clinic"" on the Internet. In the group, doctors conduct online prediction and treatment, and give medical advice. ""Sometimes healing, often helping, always comforting."" This medical assistance team opened one after another ""prescription"". As the ""big head"" of the community and the ""backbone"" of the community worker team, Ni Xiaoqian rushed to the community epidemic prevention every day. In her early 40s, she always laughed and said, ""Recently, there are more and more white hair. These old -fashioned white hair grows from the 2020 epidemic.""

Seeing that it was almost on May 28, the family would be completely broken at home. The child may be life -threatening at any time because of the deterioration of the condition. To this end, the whole family was anxious and tried to make a pediatric doctor through the healthy cloud app and other methods, but the system always reminded the errors. After touching the wall everywhere, I couldn't eat it, and the child's mother often washed her face with tears.

We finally rescued the child's life. Do you still have to watch him leave us?!"" The phone number The head is a heavy sigh and trembling voice. Father's help is urgent. After sending the most urgent information to the ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" public welfare alliance, Ms. Xu ""Mother Yaoshen"" immediately replied: ""This incident, I will help!"" This mother's child is also leukemia. patient. In order to prevent 6 children who are sympathetic to the disease, she has worked hard to find the chemotherapy drug ""Men Dong"" from Guangzhou. For this reason, she was called ""Mother of the Medicine God"" by other children's family members.

Space,Discipline and stocking,Space,"What is Gong Jing's high -frequency word in Shanghai before, rice noodle oil is also, vegetables, fruits, meat egg milk, and cola drink chocolate Maifen's non -basic life can be called luxury. The minimum frequency is definitely not the best to be seen. It was all the rage. Everyone was saying that they would learn to throw things, but now all kinds of foods are good. Food, what's wrong, eat; chocolate biscuits, treasures that fall out of the corner; throwing on the frozen drawer without seeing brown sugar cakes, make people feel stable; where they do not eat green leafy vegetables, where they will waste; they will waste; Don't eat this, don't eat that, now eat it; group purchases look at thousands of eyes, and choose three picks? If you do n’t buy food, you must care about food, vegetables and meat and eggs; those who eat and drink, also learn to save money and leave room ... Of course, it is better to get better. The favorite coffee chocolate is available. The residential community began to seal the solution on March 9th, so I can buy online and buy online. The refrigerator is not large, at least enough to be stuffed. I won't go to grab the vegetables. Later, I participated in the community group purchase. Speaking of it, it is usually a bit small hoarding. Foods are usually paid for double portions. If there is a proper thing, you may wish to share a few more, and you can also share relatives and friends. Wearing a mask in early April, I checked the drawer cabinet carton every corner of each corner. It was found that in addition to the refrigerator storage, there were some black beans and black sesame powder, several red bean peanuts, and several canned biscuits. There are a few fungus and ascetic bamboo shoots, and the different categories of the door are cooked. The medicines are also counted and sorted out. Although the tea is not hungry, it can also be annoyed. After cleaning up, I have a sense of gain. In mid -April, Teacher Y of the Fudan Branch of the China Progressive Progressive called and greeting. I said that there are people in my life, and I usually have some small stocks. Whether it will play all the food for a while and a half. You also have it yourself. He said that he was not willing to throw things, so now it's okay to see it. After communicating, they are all 60 people, so they are all people who have experienced the age, and they have suffered from the scarce of that era. At that time, everything had to be provided by tickets, and half of the two grain stamps were also treasures. Get up at four or five in the morning and follow the grandmother to line up to buy soy products. To buy some hot air meat, you have to catch up early. One person cannot be available to queue with bricks. Fortunately, everyone is with each other and will not reprimand you. Summer vegetable markets are purchased fresh vegetables. The news spreads all over the old street like wind. In the afternoon, she took the bamboo basket and walked towards the vegetable field. The tomato cucumber was finished. Essence Eat the churros to be restrained. Finally, you can leave a small cut, make some soy sauce boil and cook, sprinkle some green onions, and make a soup meal. In such a growth age, the crisis genes will be burned in the bones, even if they are not actively printed by themselves. SARS, COVID-19, in the middle of the development of the times, observing the reading work and life, deep in the heart does not seem to have a full sense of security because of the stability of life and age. Personally, it is certain that uncertainty is certain, impermanence is normal. Ordinary people can't grasp the general trend. It is okay to reserve some materials a little. Of course, there is no need to cup the bow snake shadow. It is scared by themselves. There is a psychological preparation. Looking at the dialogue in the group buying group, many young people are young people. They start to miss snail powder, miss the cola drink cake, and eat spicy fried chicken, and Baoma is nervous about eating and eating the food. Guess is mostly 85 or post -90s. The understanding of the necessities in different ages is different. After all, the smartphone is the age of the smartphone. Except for the rice noodle oil carrot, the greenberry cola cake cannot be bought. After all, they have not experienced a period of constraints. The concepts of the two generations are not strange to conflict during the special period. It does not agree with this, and the experience accumulated by the sealing control probably makes people more likely to identify what needs to be applied, and which should be disconnected. For example, whether the addiction to constantly change new products needs to be interrupted and far beyond whether the consumption behavior of your purchasing power is self -provoked, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. In addition to material, some people who are not conspiring must be separated, or they have to look forward to the past, or even some Utopia -like imagination.

Space,Like the familiar strangers,Space,"Early in the morning of Li Dawei, the child shouted: ""Xiao Bao, go to the children's playground in the community to receive flowers!"" ""My son is doing his homework."" I came forward: ""I'll take it!"" ""What to do?"" It turned out to be Mother's Day! Yes, relative to me, she is a lady, not a mother. I drove my son to pick it up, and found that the husband took the child, holding the flawless peony, went home and gave it to his mother, and sent it by the child. If the mothers go to receive flowers and dedicate themselves to themselves, there is no face! Women can burn themselves for themselves and do themselves. You can also go home from get off work on Friday, buy a bunch of flowers for yourself, go home and insert it in the glazed waist bottle in the round table in the middle of the living room to add a good mood to yourself. But presented flowers to yourself, not to work hard, but hey. Just like talking about friends, it must be a man who invites women: drinking tea, eating and watching movies, this is called hidden rules. The rules written on the blackboard, such as wearing a suit and tie in the office. It is self -evident that the hidden rules, such as entering the office cannot wear vests and slippers. Naturally, it is called ""culture"", such as giving flowers to the older aunt on Mother's Day. Marriage advanced coffee shop, men pay for. After marriage, enter the coffee shop and pay for the lady. Fashionable women, passing the coffee shop after get off work, go in, pay for themselves, pay for themselves, look at the street view, and then go home. It is Shanghai's western culture, which is common on the streets of Paris. But strange men come to pay for you, and most people will not accept it frankly. Take the flower point in the children's playground. This position makes the mothers feel proud. The best magnetic field is equivalent to a man standing in the green belt near the women's toilet, holding a bag and other girlfriends. There are hard board boxes stacked under the shading canopy. The two girls guarded and smiled and handed the bouquets of the speaker mouth. The oil painting paper was like a candle bag to care for the straight flower. There are nearly a thousand households in our community, which is a lot of expenses. More than a few genuine LV bags, this is style and realm. There is also a neighbor in the community. Starting from the production agricultural feed, he became the new hope of the richest man in China at that time. Later, he expanded the pig farming career. When she was closed in April, the food was nervous. She decided to give it away. One household, one shoulder, a pig, a pig's left and right shoulders, one shoulder from the shoulders to the end, chopped off the head and legs, the middle -end rectangular: pork belly and ribs. The soft skin is hot, and the red pot of red pot is not only sprayed, but also slightly sweet. Women in Shanghai are very stubborn, especially before marriage, with a tofu rack. The Shanghai dialect is called ""letting go"", let the pursuit turn around you, and you can't find your mind. Under the logic: It is difficult to get before marriage, and cherish it after marriage. If the enthusiasm of the marriage before marriage, the Shanghai people will call it a ""inverted account"" and collapse! Miss and sisters couldn't raise their heads for a lifetime. During this time in Shanghai, a large number of volunteers emerged in various communities, and women accounted for most of them: the post time was attached to the copper, all of which were ""inverted accounts"", and they did not ask for returns like the sun. The term ""inverted account"" started Phoenix Nirvana during the epidemic, and the derogatory cocoons were molted. There is a group of owners in the front community, and there are very few people. It is for the election industry committee. I heard that it was a quarrel group. After being blocked, almost the households are involved in this group, watching each other. Whoever lacks printing paper, immediately put on the position of the placement of the goods, and indicate the house number, so that you do n’t have to knock on the door to thank you, you can avoid being disturbed, but also help, and maintain a temperature distance. The distance of the bowl of hot soup. When you open the door at night and place the donation, there may be a short -necked beer to show the gratitude of the beneficiary. Sometimes the regiments' campaigns cannot reach the starting share, so they naturally take off, and then send the excess to the security guard to clean. Everyday I am busy paying attention to the group. Basically, my wife is not known, but they have been communicated with each other. The neighbors of the Qianqian Community are ""atomic people"" who are isolated from each other. They have become ""strange friends"" in the group. For example, on both sides of the knife, they areolate each other and their backs. The blade is the convergence point. Now go out for a walk after meals, face to face, and immediately nod with a smile, even though they are still unfamiliar friends. The crisis means turning, worshiping the seal, and the Shanghai people have improved again: from the smile on the acquaintances, evolved to a smile on strangers. Before being sealed, the Shanghai people turned a blind eye to strangers, especially the strange opposite sex, otherwise there would be suspicion of idiot. The acquaintance society is friendly to acquaintances, which is the civilization of farming villages. Strangers society is friendly to strangers, which is urban civilization. Smiling to acquaintances and indifferent to strangers has always been the facial expression of urban people. Before being sealed, the Shanghai people were the city in the public rules, the old street from the old street of Hongzhen, the native of Hubei, Qingyunli, and the Yonganli Cantonese. The shadow of the rural acquaintance society. In the period of being blocked, the neighbors in the community began to report to strangers with friendly smiles. The tails of the Shanghai people began to cut the villagers in the city -the realm is limited to obeying the rules of traffic, otherwise the fines are bad, which is due to the gains and losses from the material level; throwing off the shadow of the rural acquaintance society -smiling for strangers. Send pork in April and flowers in May. Giving meat is the material level, and flowers are spiritual.

Like me, the party age is longer, and the major juncture should go up. Is n’t it? He never said empty words. After arriving at the community, immediately put on the dense and windy ""big white"" protective clothing, wearing a mask with deep marks, and on duty with the cadres of the neighborhood committee to keep the night together; assist the medical staff to check the inspection, maintain order to carry the supplies together, and one way, one way Solving anxiety for the masses ...

After he investigated, he immediately took the whole group to do a few hard things: first, all the staff screening, the inspection should be checked, and the bottom of the family should be found out; , Without leaving home, resolutely cut off the spread chain. The last thing was particularly difficult to do. They severely warned illegal actors, asking public security laws and law enforcement to law enforcement, righteousness and evil, and formed a strong positive energy in the community. On the other hand, they discussed with the neighborhood committee: 70%of the community are migrant workers, and they have a strong appetite. At the end of April, there was a schematic diagram.

Space,Mo Lang marriage Zero-Covid,Space,"Beibei, ""The epidemic is the marriage mirror of marriage."" It is reasonable. In the long -term control of the long home, the ""demon"" and ""immortal"" are in shape. Some related social news sparked our thinking. Why do some people want to divorce, while others want to remarry? The British drama ""Crown 4"", which shows the relationship between Diana, Charles and Camilla, gave an answer. This drama interpreted why Diana's marriage lost to Charles's love from the perspective of psychology, and why Diana had the love of the people of the world but could not have the love of her husband. At the psychological level, the relationship between Charles and Diana is like father and daughter. Unfortunately, he does not like some men to control the relationship. What he likes is a mature and equal dialogue relationship. Diana worked very hard during the entire marriage, but the harder, the more unfortunately, the more and the farther and farther she pushed Charles. Because her efforts are not on the idea, there is no ""voting for it"", but focusing on her hobbies, such as showing dancing and singing opera. Charles likes Shakespeare and gardening, but Diana has no interest. At the beginning of marriage, they must have worked together, but they had little effect, the spiritual improvement and psychological level of maturity were not overnight; the two must have a happy time. Diana's maturity cannot keep up with the pace of Charles. In contrast, Camilla, she seemed to be watching the fire from the other side, and accidentally involved in the war. She didn't deliberately please, and Charles had always needed her. She knew the current situation. When Charles wanted to divorce, she advised him not to leave. She had a clear positioning of herself, mature and emotional, and the more Charles loved her. The nobles have no life of life and the pareness, and only seek some spiritual things, so Charles cannot be separated from her because she can give Charles a sense of psychological comfort and belonging, and her sentence must make him deadly. She wins without fighting, and her relationship with Charles has been strong for a long time. Diana has always tried to find love in marriage and does not want to face the reality of Charles who doesn't love her. This is the source of her pain. Love is not a war, but a powerful inner attraction. Perhaps it is quantum entanglement, or maybe a system is accustomed to one system that cannot be compatible with another. If she sees this clearly, the ending may be different. As the princess, Diana was very successful, but she was not loved by her husband. This situation made her win more people's love. Her global influence at that time did not lose Mrs. Sachel. If she used this influence to do more social work and achieve her workplace value as the ""princess"" instead of being a happy wife, it would not be the case. Pain, and a happy person can always have a stronger energy magnetic field, and it will also usher in more suitable love. To this day, marriage has been combined from ""combination of interests"" to ""combination of love"" to ""psychological suitable"". We look around and find that you can enter the marriage hall of the marriage regardless of the reason why you can meet each other's psychological needs for a long time. Understanding, enlightening, equality, and mutual heavyness have become keywords for modern marriage, and these keywords are rooted in the growth of cognition and psychological levels. The harmonious pace of growth can jump out of moving double dance. Love is a fairy tale, and only nobles can love first; marriage is reality, and the lives of ordinary people. We can still believe in the beauty of fairy tales, and we must dare to face the relentlessness of reality.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/8.htm,5/28/22,8th edition: Nightlight Cup,

Li Qiang listened carefully to the records and exchanged in -depth discussions with representatives of the participating levels. He said that the current situation of the Shanghai epidemic prevention and control is continuing to improve, and all aspects of the city have worked hard for this, especially the comrades at the grassroots level, played an important role. When the epidemic struck, everyone resolutely carried the burden and tried everything to protect the life lines of the city and the living line of the people. Many comrades ""connecting the axis"" every night to take care of the lives of millions of households, soothe the emotions of the citizens, and care about the special group.

Everyone's persistence, tenacity, and persistence fully demonstrate the power of unity, the power of mutual assistance, the power of the upward, and the power of love. Li Qiang pointed out that at present, we are accelerating the conversion of the prevention and control stage of the normalization epidemic, allowing the masses to go out of the house in an orderly manner, to accelerate the economic recovery and revive, and let the city's fireworks return soon. Many tasks need to rely on the first -line comrades of the grassroots level. We must resolutely overcome the paralysis thoughts, mood, fluke, and relaxed mentality. Units, no epidemic buildings, etc. We must adhere to the good mechanisms and methods of contacting the people, do a good job of visiting the masses and visiting enterprises, care for the lives of the masses, dredge emotions, and solve the difficulty of re -production and production of enterprises. Most of the cities, districts, streets, and communities should mostly solve problems for enterprises. The party committees and governments at all levels should give the grassroots more concern, support and help, arrange your rotation and rest in time, have greater effort to activate grass -roots experience, motivate grassroots cadres, stimulate grassroots vitality, report well, and promote the grassroots line. Policy formulation should listen to the grassroots opinions more, so that the grassroots can feel the channels more smooth, the information is more symmetrical, and the operation is more convenient.

In the past two days, residents have been opened in an orderly manner in accordance with regulations. Once, this is the ""storm point"" of Jiading's epidemic, with a maximum of 106 people in a single day. Wu Si Village is the largest ""city village"" in Jiading District. The village houses, 39 companies, and apartment buildings are staggered. In this round of epidemic, there were more than 1,200 confirmed cases in May 4th Village, which was a tackling point. On April 18th, Zhang Guomin, the chairman of the Jiangqiao Town Federation of Jiading District, 53, Zhang Guomin, chairman of the Jiangqiao Town Federation of Jiading District, and the head of the cadre group of Wuwu Village, came here with colleagues. The division of labor in the 11 working groups of the ""fire point"" clearly made clear that in the area area of about 0.8 square kilometers of May 4th Village, there were more than 9,000 people in the real population, and foreign migrant workers gathered, accounting for 88%of the total population. There were only a dozen of the original village cadres. For decades of high -intensity and long -term overload, new cases that are unable to live, and villagers do not understand ... All these have allowed their physical and mental to reach the edge of the collapse. On April 18, Zhang Guomin received a call from the party secretary of Jiangqiao Town. Within 30 minutes, he rushed to May 4th Village with his colleagues and persisted to this day. At the beginning, he only brought 4 colleagues to May 4th Village, responsible for transshipment, elimination, material collection, and special security management. In the next few days, the staff and volunteers on the point increased to 93. These reinforcements bring confidence to the grassroots cadres and masses of the May 4th Village. ""After arriving at the station, our first thing is to set up a data analysis group to touch the information of the whole village and analyze all data."" Zhang Guomin knows the importance of finding the bottom number. In his opinion, the first time Mastering the ""fire point"" can make timely and effective responses. From that day, the working group will make daily newspapers based on dynamic information. According to the actual situation, Zhang Guomin also subdivided 11 working groups including the command team, the living security group, the nucleic acid testing group, the material security group, and the logistics support group, and launched 12 ""stricter conventions"" to carry out village -level epidemic prevention work. Eliminate the ""strictest"" management of 5 public toilets. ""The whole village is like a large yard, there are many elderly people, many children, and the hardware conditions are poor. The difficulties in front of the people are obvious: the staff of the May 4th village are dense and narrow, and often infected by a person, it will cause the whole building to ""destruction"". 80%of the people in the village have no toilets, and they use 5 public toilets together. Zhang Guomin and his colleagues have thought about many countermeasures, and finally chose the ""strictest"" public toilet management method: ""Each public toilet in the village arranges two people 24 hours a guard, and requires only one person to enter and exit each time. Many cases ... By May 7, the number of new infected people dropped to ""0"". I dare not slack off, like my 52nd marathon. In fact, before sinking to the fifth 4th village, Zhang Guomin and colleagues have been fighting for 25 days in Zengjian Village, Jiangqiao Town. Zengjian Village was the only central risk area in Jiading District. It can be said that the two most difficult ""hard bones"" in Jiading's epidemic in this round of the epidemic are inseparable from the dedication of Zhang Gui and colleagues. For more than two months, Zhang Guomin felt the most owed to his mother. ""My mother is 86 years old and can't hear the back of the ear. She lives in Zengjian Village. Previously, five of our children would visit her every week."" Later, in the days when Zhang Guomin sank to support Zengjian Village as a long time to serve as a long time, Due to the control management, although she could not look at my mother every day through the doorstep. ""After she was infected, it was transferred to other staff members; after she got out of the cabin, I worked in the Village of Wuwi and couldn't take care of her."" These days, Zhang Guomin burst into tears more than once: When I do n’t come to see me, when I saw my colleagues fighting for the front line without regrets, when I saw the villagers queuing in an orderly manner to coordinate the transfer ...

After the lease expired on April 14 this year, due to the epidemic control, all the items were unable to move out of the items. On May 20, after strictly implementing various prevention and control measures, I urgently cleared the venue. However, I did not expect that the intermediary and the second landlord refused to collect the house and refused to return the deposit on the grounds of this. I asked me to bear the rent of two months after the lease was over, and even said that it would claim through legal channels. Citizen Ms. Lu helped >>> Delayed moved away from the claim. ""I'm really there now!"" At noon yesterday, when the Xinmin Evening News ""Battle Epidemic · helping Nong"" urgently asked for the hotline live phone connection, Ms. Lu's words were full Helpless and helpless. She told reporters that the house's monthly rent was 6,500 yuan per month, and the rent period was one year. From March this year, the house was unavailable due to the epidemic control. After she paid a year of rent, after she moved all the items to clean the house on May 20, the two landlords and intermediaries not only resolutely refused to collect the house, but also made claims. ""I have promised that the 6,500 yuan deposit can not be used as a one -month rent for one month, but they still do not depend on it. I have to bear a monthly rent from May to June, otherwise it will take further action."" Faced with this, this will face this. ""Facing this this In the aggressive posture, Ms. Lu was completely covered. The intermediary and landlord said that there were no faults to get in touch with the ""Tang Goose Rental and Sales"". A manager who claimed to be a surname Gao said that in this incident, the intermediary and the second landlord had no fault. Ms. Lu did not perform the contract to pay the house on time. "" Signed the contract to do things. "" The reporter proposed that the parties cannot handle the house in accordance with the terms of the contract. It is also due to force majeure factors such as epidemic conditions. Whether it can be from the tenant's perspective and no longer account for claims. In this regard, Manager Gao disagreed and insisted that the two landlords had suffered losses during the epidemic. Now the house cannot be rented, and Ms. Lu must take responsibility for this. This matter has been handled by the company's legal affairs, and it will be resolved through legal channels. Lawyer: The tenant requested it reasonably. The reporter consulted Qin Yubin, a senior partner of Shanghai Shan Law Firm. Attorney Qin believes that the cause of the epidemic cannot move out of the items inside the house in time, which is a reasonable request. For example, the landlord and the intermediary refusing to refund the deposit and claim the liquidated damages on the grounds of this, there is no basis for the law. In this case, although the landlord refuses to accept the house, it should be regarded as the lessee that has returned the house and can be required to refund the deposit. Qin Yubin suggested that when the lessee signs the ""Lease Contract"", the lease can add the detailed rules for the processing of irresponsibility to move away from the house in time in order to encounter a similar situation and can be resolved according to the contract. Under the epidemic, have any intermediary and the second landlord ""pass the loss"" to the tenants? Should Ms. Lu pay for this? Newspaper will continue to focus on.

Space,"Is this a ""New Cold War"" for China?","Wang Yigang arrived in the Pacific Island, the United States started a small action","Do not seek the ""New Cold War"" with China, which is a clear expression of US Secretary of State Brillin's speech on China on the 26th. However, on the 27th local time, the White House suddenly announced that Fiji will become the 14th country to join the ""Indo -Pacific Economic Framework"" (IPEF). At present, Wang Yi, a Chinese member and foreign minister, is visiting the Pacific Islands, and the political nature of the ""Indo -Pacific Economic Framework"" is well known. Is Brinken's words, do you do it? On the 26th, Fiji was forcibly bound by the United States and Australia. On the 26th, the State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi opened a visit to the Pacific Island and East Timor, and will host the second China-Pacific Island Foreign Minister Association in Fiji. This is a normal interaction between the country, but the United States and Australia and other countries are like the enemy. On the 26th, Australian Foreign Minister Huang Yingxian suddenly flew to Fiji. After that, the United States first announced that Fiji would become the first Pacific Island country to join the IPEF. The domineering, selfishness, and arrogance of the United States and Australia and other countries show this: On the one hand, Fiji joins the IPEF or not, and the decision is to be itself. Fiji has not stated yet, but the United States is anxious to announce that considering the gap between the historical exchanges and strength between the two countries, what is the difference between it is forcibly bundled? On the other hand, Brinken just claimed that he did not seek to seek a ""new cold war"" with China, but he tried to obstruct the normal exchanges between other countries and China. What is the difference between this move and built another ""iron curtain""? No matter how beautiful Bollinger said, the US -Australian media's evaluation of its ""urgent action of stable backyard"" has completely reflected its deep -rooted Cold War thinking. US trade representative Daiqi publicly claimed on the 20th that IPEF was to counter the influence of China in the region. As a result, the new horse stroke camp did not have a good way to say a set of routines to the United States, and many countries in the Asia -Pacific region saw it very clearly. On the 27th, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir attended the ""Future of Asia"" during the 27th International Exchange Conference in Tokyo, saying that IPEF excluded China outside, ""this is a very wrong attitude."" If the United States sincerely hopes to promote regional growth and prosperity, China should also invite China to join the framework. Mahathir emphasized that China did not take a very ""good"" action against the United States. Instead, the United States continued to wave ""sanctions"" from China and restricts the development of trade with China. Any rule of China ’s trading alliance is not conducive to strengthening multilateral trade cooperation in the Indo -Pacific region. Coincidentally, Singapore Prime Minister Li Xianlong said in a speech in the ""Future of Asia"" that the difficulties of relations between the United States and China will directly affect the Asia -Pacific region. If the Asian countries are split into two camps, there will be no good results. Li Xianlong also said that China's economic influence in Asia has made regional benefits a lot. China has been participating in affairs in the Asia -Pacific region and proposed the ""Belt and Road"" initiative and global development initiative. Singapore supports these initiatives and is also a member of the ""Friends of the Global Development Initiative"". Regarding IPEF, Li Xianlong believes that it cannot replace the ""Comprehensive and Progressive Cross -Pacific Partnership Agreement"" (CPTPP), and said Singapore welcomes China to join the latter. China will wait and see that China will have a tough attack after Blingken delivered a speech. On the 26th, Wang Yi said in an interview with the Solomon Islands that the Pacific island nation is a sovereign independent country, not for who's ""backyard""; all have the right to make their own choices, not to be the vassal of others. Assistant and spokesman Hua Chunying on the evening of the 27th on his personal social platform Twitter on the evening of the 27th, he issued a ""point -to -point"" attack on the content of Brinken. Hua Chunying said that Brins' speech sounded more like a declaration of comprehensive strategic competition or war on China. As for ""the United States is willing to carry out constructive contact with China, China and the United States can live peacefully."" Facts are better than arguments. We will wait and see for these commitments of Brinken in the speech. Reporter Yang Yifan",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/6.htm,5/29/22,6th edition: Comprehensive News/Announcement,

The fish died when the water was out of water and could not be put on hold. One day's color changes; two -day fragrance changes; three -day taste changes, you can't eat it anymore. The catfish eaten by the new horse is called ""thorn shell"", which is mostly produced in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Once, Mr. Cai Lan came to the new and ate at a restaurant.

Twenty miles is a post, night hanging lights, day hanging flags, connecting the station one by one, and passing the horse. I arrived in Beijing a day and one night. The rhythm of this fast horse whip is compared with Yang Guifei eating Lingnan litchi. This year, the catfish came from Zhenjiang triggered, and three freshened were selected from them. There was no discoloration. Liu Ye used the plan to grab the fish head and get the delicious fish body. On the dining table, everyone talked again from the catfish to ""three hates"". In fact, the three hate originated from the ""five hate"" of the Song people. The Song Dynasty monk Hui Hong (the surname of Peng) had a ""Leng Zhai Night Talk"". The book mentioned that his uncle Peng Yuancai had ""five hates"": ""One hates catfish and bone bone, two hate golden oranges with sour, three hate saga dishes Several sexes, four hate Begonia is not fragrant, and five hate Zeng Zishu can't poetry.

Zhang Ailing's two hates of the three hate (catfish thorns, begonia without fragrance) from here, she added a hate ""the red building is not finished."" Chinese characters are delicate. Hate here is actually a regret, not hate, and the focus is on the words. In life, we often upgrade ""regret"" to ""hate"", which is not good. Well, it is inevitable; hate, try to resolve.

The group purchase of our community is organized in an orderly manner, and everyone has no shortage of living materials. A young neighbor was embarrassed to confess: ""The family is full of food, but I see group buying in the group still participate every time, I'm afraid it's not enough ..."" Perhaps it was originally estimated to be inadequate. Young can be so sick. There is no restraint in hoarding, indicating that there is shadow in my heart, which is anxiety. In the WeChat group of the building, I saw the neighbors and the team leader dialogue: ""Is there no need to test the antigen today?"" ""I did not notify the testing material. If there is a test desire, I will ask."" Not suitable. ""I don't feel good. In fact, I am not afraid of the virus until now, but I am afraid of all kinds of social problems exposed after the control. If we cannot learn lessons from the crisis, the society will not be seriously retreat, but it will be difficult to guarantee that we will not repeat the same mistakes in the future. On Douyin, many foreign compatriots took Shanghai Fengsong. Some people have released the material of early food shortages to guide the Shanghai people. In the future, they will learn that northerners stain their Chinese cabbage to spend winter and store more vegetables. Don't always think about eating fresh. Below, there are even comments that always want to eat fresh vegetables, indicating that Shanghai people are too small and too aggressive. I read it, I couldn't help but follow the post: Waiting for littering, the epidemic has passed, I still have to buy fresh vegetables every day. The market is so developed and logistics is so smooth. Why not enjoy it well? Let others have positions and life because of your enjoyment. Everyone's hard work and decent life is a normal society.

As of yesterday, there were 178 people who returned to work in the Tianci Park. In addition, the number of people who stayed before the epidemic was more than half of the usual number and production capacity. Tianci International Park has settled in Xinchang Town for 8 years and covers an area of 211 acres. It adopts an original shared pharmaceutical model to unite many well -known innovative drug manufacturers. ""Fosun Kate's first CAR-T cell therapy products that have been approved to be listed are the"" life-saving medicine ""of lymphoma patients. Different from traditional drugs, CAR-T cell therapy is personalized and customized drugs. Each patient is every patient. It is a separate production batch. There is no inventory of this medicine. The factory must ensure that the entire process is uninterrupted; a batch of more batch can save one more patient. "" Essence The first long -term reorganization coagulation of Shengs creature has applied for listing, which can change the fate of many healing families. The second innovative drug has also been approved to enter clinical trials. It is urgent to complete the construction of production workshops. In addition, the COVID-19 virus MRNA (messenger ribosacucleucleic acid) vaccine independently developed by Simai Bio was approved by the State Drug Administration on April 29. Clinical trials will be carried out, and clinical samples are urgently needed to prepare. The production demand of these companies in the enterprise is urgent, and the innovative drugs of innovative drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19 viruses caused by Tianci International's independently developed clinical trials and production preparations in Phase 3 and production preparations also need to be carried out. In mid -April, Tianci International became the key ""whitelist"" enterprise in Shanghai's first batch of work and re -production cities. Later, Shengsi Biological has become the first batch of whitelist companies in the construction site of Pudong New District. On April 28, the first batch of workers entered the park. Tianci International immediately decided that the park entered the ""dual -closed loop"" management model, that is, the park continued to implement fully closed management to eliminate external risks. The warning line also provides 24 -hour security services to avoid the risk of cross -crowded personnel. It is understood that the three core elements of drug production: professional and technical personnel, high -precision equipment, raw and auxiliary materials supply. The types of employees in each enterprise in the park are relatively diversified, including scientists, production engineers, managers, and construction staff. After the work and re -production, the cafeteria must not only make a period of time for three meals a day, but also try their best to meet the various personalized needs of customers. ""Margion beds, sleeping bags, toiletries, disinfection agents, protective clothing, beverages, snacks, milk, fruit ..."" The supply of self -operated supermarkets in the park allows everyone to resume work with peace of mind. The key factor in the park's safety production is equipment safety. Affected by the epidemic, the original equipment maintenance unit suspended the on -site service. To this end, the park's own engineering team was stationed in the post, rolling up his sleeves to do it by himself. Within 2 months, he repaired production equipment such as power, water systems, and air conditioners dozens of times to exclude multiple production safety risks. Every night, everyone paid for the same day to ensure the production of Zhang Jiang's innovative medicine. So far, the park has maintained ""zero infection"" and ""zero accidents"".

There are also phoenix fish, ponds, three white, and crayfish. You see, Huang Yan is shaking his head! Hutu is said to be ""Little Summer Scarlet Radium Ginseng"". Every time I eat it, Jiangnan Limin, who is rice rice, is a reasons for him to find himself. After the summer, the meat quality is the most fat. When you do n’t eat it at this time, when will it be? People in Shanghai eat scutellaria baicalensis, in addition to the gangs' skeleton paste, pork belly roasted bun, bacon bin tube soup, shredded eggs and eggs, as well as Su Xicai and Huaiyang cuisine, Liangxi Crispy Crispy, raw burst tadpole Back, tiger tail, fried soft pocket, etc. The shrimp burst of Hangzhou Kuiyuan Pavilion is also good. The bridge is passed, half of the wine, half of the noodles; a few years ago, I ate a pot of coriander stalks in the ancient town of Qianli. When the hot day falls, the Shanghai people eat cold noodles with frozen mung bean soup. Do you not want to do it? Huang Yan appeared very early in the history of the Chinese people. In the Book of Songs, there is a description of ""bandit bandits, absconding from Yuan"". Some people think that crickets are catfish, but some people have verified that they are catfish. However, ""Escape from Yuan"" is very similar to the habit of Huang Yan, which is the law of survival passed down from generation to generation. Huang Tingjian understood that Bai Yao wrote Huang Yan in his ""Three Refers to the History of the Play"": ""There are no chickens and frogs in the year, and the frogs are fried."" The taste is not bad, with pine wine just right. Yao Mu Shuang and Zhou Baichun's unique drama ""Learning English"" makes people laugh. Teacher Yao said that foreigners do not eat yellow crickets, and English does not have the word ""yellow cricket"". People in Shanghai understand. Wang Anyi wrote in Yangzhou people in the novel ""A Sword, Thousand Words"". It can also be seen in the vegetable field in Yangwan. The Shanghai people use the toothbrush handle, not only the technology, but also the mood. Once, Mr. Hua Yonggen, Suzhou Food Coffee, invited Brother Guobin to eat in Xinjufeng in the eunuch. There was a pot of fried stir -fry in the seat, and the country was impeccable. Mr. Hua said: ""The chef of Su Gang Cai is very particular about the catfish. The silk stir -frying baicalensis needs to be sorted, burn, and eaten. There are more than ten kinds of seasonings. Taste with lard, add some vegetable oil when boiling, and drizzle some sesame oil when it is thickened. When the waiter is on the side of the stove, the master of the head of the head is poured, and she quickly brings up in front of you and rang along the way. ""But the best Huang Yan cuisine is still in Huaiyang. Wang Zengqi wrote in the article ""Fish I Witch"": ""Huai'an people can make full mats, a table of vegetables, all catfish. In addition to roasting baicalensis, tiger tails, etc., the main method is to stir -fry. The second is burning. Clear cooked cooked shredded and frying, called 'soft pocket'; fried fried crispy boring. The braised bald section is called the ""burning saddle bridge"", and the thicker bald section ""Zhang Fei"". The fish must have a lot of ginger and garlic, and sprinkle pepper after serving. Add ginger slices and shallots and Shaojiu rice vinegar to boil, picked it up and picked up, mixed with marinade, pour a spoonful of garlic oil, and eat pepper. Essence The frying soft pocket is quite localized. The chef chose ""pen green"", only take double -back meat, grin into half a foot to grow, and then drain after simmering. Stir -fry the onion ginger and garlic with cooked lard, put it into the fragrance of the ginger and garlic, put it in the segment and stir fry a few times. After all the marinade is pocket, push the lard and push it well. If you eat half of it, if you add a little pink powder with chicken soup, it is a soft pocket with powder. Frying soft pocket is ""burning red cliffs"", focusing on fire work. In the early summer of last year, I ate a frying soft pocket in a restaurant opposite the movie studio. Strange taste. Soft pockets fry up, and I believe that Huaiyang cuisine ""Liu Lang is now here again."" It was also when I ate bayberry last year, and went to the Wujiang Hotel in Suzhou to visit the Master Xu Hefeng, who developed the Jiangnan Canal Banquet with Brother Guobin. I also asked him to do a white cord door. The so -called umbilical door refers to the belly meat of catfish. It is particularly soft because of the near -cloaca. A yellow croaker weighing about 400 grams can take a three -inch long section. It takes more than 20 big yellow croaks to make a white cord door. The tiger tail and the soft pockets are used to use the back of the 鳝, and if the belly is ""walking once a thousand years"", it rely on the cord door to go out. Borrowing Yixing casserole, it is best to be covered with dirt. The belly of the 鳝 is cooked through multiple procedures such as 汆, hot, and crickets. The color is white like milk, the glutinous is crispy and soft, and the aftertaste is endless. The Baiya Umbilical Gate is the signature dish of the two Huai catfish feasts. The Baili umbilical gate has been ""missing"" in general recipes. In the 1950s, the ""Recipe Collection"" edited by the Shanghai Municipal Government Affairs Administration was recorded -haha, the editor -in -chief of this book is Shen Jingjing Shen Jing Like Mr., Tianwang -level food coffee.

"Filial piety and juniors do not want to let the grandmother's grandmother and the old mother work too hard to complete the ""most difficult transportation"" ","Store installation security helps to lift the ""complete"" nursing bed to the end of the house ",Space ,"I asked my grandmother at the age of 94 and lived at 229 Fugui East Road, Changning District. On April 29, a sudden stroke was hemiplegia. After a comprehensive assessment, the old man was taken home to recuperate. Although her mother and her grandmother lived together, she was also 63 -year -old after all. She gave me the tea for the elderly to send meals and rolled over her urine. She was exhausted. Due to the sealing of the community, I couldn't rush to help, and I was anxious at home. I am now asking for a care bed, which can make my grandmother lying comfortably and make my mother work less. Citizen Mr. Liu helped >>> After the second old age, the old and sour reporters learned that Mr. Liu's grandmother's grandmother was sent to Huashan Hospital of Fudan University due to the epidemic reasons. Essence Now that the old man moves a little, he needs his daughter to help. He stays next to the old man every day, and always takes care of eating, drinking, Lasa. For Mr. Liu's 63 -year -old mother, he is also inadequate and insufficient. ""The community is closed, and if you want to find a caregiver, it is not possible.

SPACE,Three Spring by Shanghai people has gone through the three spring,Space,"He Fei adults sometimes have a pressure cooker, and some potential desires occasionally run out quietly through the pressure valve. Forty days closed, I traveled in my dreams for three consecutive nights, namely Beijing, Qingtian, and Zhangye. I just landed in Zhangye Airport in the early morning of that day. I was woke up from the sleeping dream: ""Do nucleic acid!"" It gave me a lot of comfort. Once I unknowingly rode 24 kilometers, I was still unreasonable. There is an isolated belt and a barrier, but Mr. Police is very nice, kindly rational, and personable. The car pocket is equipped with cola. The wind of early summer is light and pleasant. The French sycamore looks like a huge lettuce. She wakes up in Shanghai and hasn't washed it yet, but my heart gradually became clear. This city can be as many cities from failure, and the genes and consciousness of civilization have never left. In the past two years, I have not left Shanghai. In the past two years, many arrangements have been unable to preset, and they are often forced to interrupt. But it is not unpleasant, because I have more energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the edge corners of the neighborhoods of the city. Who knows whether today's cause will be the harvest of tomorrow's fate? Many friends have changed. In the fourth day of the New Year in 2020, the COVID-19 virus was raging in China. The friend Lin Sangang, a friend of the travel agency, returned from Japan and immediately helped me 20 N95 masks. We walked from Longxi Road in Jianhe Road to Hongqiao Road. He said that this time he might have to rest for three months. I am afraid that this wave of business in the cherry blossom season is probably missed. In 2022, Lin Sang, who has been doing tourism business for more than 20 years, has missed three cherry blossom season, and has to temporarily break the business. During the period, duty -free shop cosmetics purchasing, real estate intermediary services to Japanese people. In the past two years, the epidemic disturbances can be lived healthily and enjoyable. Like love, young people have each other, and adults only have to have each other. There are many fun of life. A girlfriend who hasn't contacted for a while, invited me to her new media video connection live program. She used to be an anchor on the radio. There are no teenagers. I often talk about Fengyue on her show. After resigning, she started her own business and became a content provider and cooperated with many platforms. After chatting for a while, I suddenly thought of asking her: Where are you the live room now? She laughed, saying that in front of her mahogany book cabinet was her live broadcast room. There were a few lights on the top, which could shine her eyes and open a beauty. ""Do you see my live broadcast effect?"" Other friends also set up a WeChat shopping group or served as distribution. It is useless and useless, I will also participate in the group to buy some support for their revenue. There are many things at home, most of them are brands and foundries that have not been seen, but the quality is good. They have played a role in the dozens of days in Shanghai's closed loop. A few days ago, my cousin who grew up with a child broke out for the first formal debate after our adults. Although our debate is intellectual and relatively restrained, no one will be persuaded by anyone. The end of the debate is to bless their own cities when they are unpredictable, and they calmly go through the difficulties. Debate at a low place and shaking hands at a high place is the friendship of adults. Thinking of a poem, ""Love is knowing, illuminating, but deeper love, preserved in the dark, like those things you know and cannot know."" On a silent day, I sometimes think of when I was 20 or 30 years old, when I was 20 or 30 years old Many people in Shanghai are like fighting chicken blood, working hard to realize themselves in the process of globalization, and create one miracle for the industry after another. The epidemic has increased the future uncertainty. Although the original order operation logic has been changed to varying degrees, the Shanghai people are still calm, warm and orderly, no publicity, no civilization reduction. Such a city and its people have been silently inspired by the opening of the port, which is worthy of respect and blessing. In the past few days, I and my friends will imagine where to go together after my life is returning to normal. On May 27, 1949, Shanghai was liberated. Starting from Chen Yi led a 100,000 -PLA army to sleep on the streets, the people of Shanghai had a high degree of trust in the government. We want to listen to the bells of the customs building. Every time it sounds, it shows the voice, awakening and strength of Shanghai. Its changes are blue, and it is born to the sea. It has long been connected into a necessary way to go to modernization and internationalization.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/7.htm,5/31/22,7th edition: Nightlight Cup,
Space,Yingri Honghua Send Yan Xiang,Space,"Wang Zhengyu has passed by the lunar calendar, and it should be almost hot summer, but sometimes he feels chill, not because of the epidemic, but that these days are often sad for some artists' departure. That evening, I heard that my beloved teacher Yan Xiang was gone, and I couldn't believe it. This is a performing artist I admired in my student days! I have loved drama from a young age. There are not many pocket money every month, and they are only willing to buy books in the show. The big world is often there. At that time, the ticket was one dime at that time. The dramas of the Yangtze River Theater also often watched. Waiting for a refund at the door. When the opening, one or two cents can wait until the front seat. Among the actors of Shanghai people, I worshiped Gao Chongshi, Jiang Jun and Yan Xiang. When I directed the TV series ""The National Affairs on the Blue Shield"", I asked Teacher Jiang Jun, and when I had an unforgettable cooperation with Teacher Yan Xiang when I was looking for the Sun of Tomorrow. ""Looking for the Sun of Tomorrow"" describes a disabled person who has lost his limbs. It is completely adapted from real people, and the male protagonist is also played by the disabled painter himself. Director Li Xiupu. I am a deputy director and a small role. Yan Xiang plays the role of the party committee secretary. I have watched him in the drama ""Sunrise"", and later watched him in the movie to play Li Shiqing. Two characters with different personalities were actually performed by the same actor. In this play, he plays a secretary who loves the masses. During the shooting, I personally felt the kindness of Teacher Yan Xiang. He was already a well -known actor at the time. He could play with people who had never been on the camera. Instead, he helped the director to explain the counseling patiently, so that the other party was very moved, and the show was shot smoothly. In the play, some camera also went to the Shanghai Oil Painting Academy to shoot. At that time, Chen Yifei and Xia Yiyuan of the Painting Academy were not famous. Teacher Yan Xiang and them were like old friends when they met. Yan Xiang's temperament is elegant, and it is most suitable for intellectuals, but performed every role, relying on not the original, but the spirit of acting skills and serious persistence. Teacher Yan Xiang and I have another cooperation in the TV series ""WP Action"". He plays the Kuomintang general Dai Wei. In the rain of the Kuomintang's deputy commander Duan, I was actually an underground party member of our party and led an armed uprising. Many actors in Shanghai Renyi participated in the performance, which can be described as a star gathered, so that I learned a lot when I participated. Wang Shihuai, who played the counter -No. 1 Qiao Lin, is similar to Yan Xiang's own temperament, but in this show's performance, it is very different. Chinese characters must not be ""one side""! Teacher Yan Xiang and I also passed by. On one occasion, I introduced me to try Sun Yat -sen. After turning makeup, I tried the show with the opponent. Unexpectedly, the opponent was Yan Xiang. I didn't know what the play wrote. After carrying the lines, I performed. After performing, Yan Xiang shook his head and said seriously, ""No, Xiao Wang's performance is too much."" The director asked me: ""Didn't you play Sun Yat -sen?"" No, in ""Sun Yat -sen and Song Qingling"", I played Song Yauru, they made a mistake. Of course, this cooperation is not successful, but I have always remembered Teacher Yan Xiang's words and serious eyes. Yes, that look is always unforgettable! ""Old Things in the South"" and ""Morning of Shanghai"" are classic masterpieces. Yingzi's father played by Yan Xiang has no traces of performance and performed furnaces. Play as ""Capitalist"". In ""Huang Qisheng and Wang Ruofei"", he starred in democratic thinkers and educators Huang Qisheng (Wang Ruofei's uncle). Honatr Han Xiyuan (""Fo Guang Xia Ying""), Huang Chujiu (""Shanghai Great World""), Overseas Chinese Giant Li Jiannan (""Li Jiannan"") and so on. The Stannislav system believes that the director inspired, exerted, and developed the creativity of the actors, and the actors in turn were inspired, exerted, and developed the creativity of the director. Yan Xiang reflected this in his acting career. Throughout his life, he has played more than 100 different roles. For an actor, what is the husband who recovers? This is a blessing! Today, Yan Xiang is gone. This year's spring is cold, and several art masters have died in the past two months. However, in the spring, she will not apply fat and apply powder, otherwise she will never wake up. After the thousands of purple redness, there will be ""the sky lotus leaves are infinitely clear, the lotus lotus is red"" The beautiful season. After removing the magic barrier, the beauty of summer has been seen. Only then, Ying Rihonghua farewell to Teacher Yan Xiang ...",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/8.htm,5/31/22,,

The public transportation in the Shanghai city resumes the orderly recovery operation. Metro and buses have resumed operations to provide services for passengers traveling. At 7:51 in the morning, at the Metro Shanghai Railway Station, the stations have begun to increase. Zhang Dazhi embarked on the return journey of returning home with the ""big bag"".

Volunteers will immediately come forward to guide. On the train, someone brushed the phone, or stood or sat, and some people lowered their heads and kept their eyes. ""The biggest feeling this morning is that Shanghai is back!"" Ms. Li, a passenger, said that she was going to work in Lujiazui. On the first day of the resumption of work and the production, there was some later consciousness. The sound of seeing the various passengers in the carriage was really lost for a long time. The 20 tram dragged the long ""braid"" and stopped at the people's square site slowly, and more than a dozen passengers were looking forward to it. ""Come here, the car is here, the Bund half -day trip starts!"" Aunt Zhao and her ""old girlfriend"" had long been looking forward to this day and the first day of restoration of travel, they planned to take the 20th route to the terminal. Go to see the Huangpu River who is thinking about. As soon as I got on the car, there were four or five passengers in the carriage. This time, everyone put down the mobile phone and looked out of the window silently to see the familiar Shencheng Street view in the past. Huang Xiaodong, the captain of the 20th team, told reporters that compared with the most lively time in the past, the traffic is still less, but I believe that through everyone's efforts, Shanghai will be able to restore the fireworks of the past. ""Hello, aunt, sit down here first, and provide you with a QR code for you to scan."" Li Yan, a flight attendant 71, has returned to normal level. The difference is that one task is added every day, that is, it is tireless to provide code scanning services to every elderly passenger. Since the resumption of work on May 22, Li Yan found in the service that the ""place code"" of the vehicle was posted on the glass before and after the carriage. Some elderly people needed to stand on the car to scan the code and scan the code. ""Our team has made a tag of the"" place code ""of the carriage for this."" Li Yan said that she would take the initiative to go to the elderly who were already seated and guided them to scan the code. According to the plan, the first and last bus time of the entire line of the Shanghai Rail Transit Network has returned to the normal level. According to the plan, the first and last bus time of the entire line of the Shanghai Rail Transit Network will return to the normal level. It should be noted that the early stages of restoring basic operations, the minimum interval between trains of each line is about 5 to 10 minutes, which is extended compared to the past. In addition, Line 2 Xujing East Station, Hongqiao Railway Station, Hongqiao Terminal 2, Line 11 Huaqiao Station, Guangming Road Station, Zhaofeng Road Station, and Shanghai Running Lot Station still suspended operations. Our reporter Ren Tianbao witnessed the history of the history of the history. The high -rise vehicle of the Bund was also ""red"" at 11.43 late last night. The two policemen of Huangpu Branch began to demolish the isolation fence at the entrance of Nanjing East. A few minutes later, the exit No. 5, the No. 5 of the Bund Chen Yi Plaza to the river embankment, was also opened. The citizens who had been waiting for a long time cheered to pass the zebra crossing all the way to Zhongshan East, surged on the hydrophilic platform, facing the Huangpu River and the night on the other side of the bank. The ""three -piece set"" of Lujiazui jumped and jumped, and sprinkled joyfully. ""So happy!"" Mr. Zhu, wearing a helmet, held his phone and screamed while rotating his body. The phone kept pressing the shutter, and his voice was so big that the security guards had to come forward to remind him. ""I'm so happy, I have been boring for more than two months, so how can I do?"" Mr. Zhu explained. He told reporters that he was doing a tobacco and alcohol business. He opened a small shop on Beibaoxing Road in Beibaoxing. The shop was closed for more than two months to make his granules no harvest, so he was particularly anxious. ""Finally, wait until this day. Today the community can be free to enter and exit. I rode a battery car and went out of the door in the afternoon. I ride aimlessly. Later, I thought about it that the Bund must come."" Many people and Mr. Zhu have the same way. idea. ""Of course, it is necessary to have a sense of ritual restart in Shanghai. The Bund is the best landmark."" Mr. Xu, who lives in Chapu Road, walked over. He fixed his mobile phone on a selfie rod and took the way all the way.

The most difficult time is that they can help everyone, hope, and feel power. Seeing that the city still has light in silence. It is also that they always convince us: with fear, there must be fear of; if there is embarrassment, there must be persistence; if there is a retreat, there must be forward. Shanghai is a people's city. For the people, it also depends on the people. In this difficult and long battle and tough battle, we deeply appreciated this. When the epidemic retreats, the resurrection of Shanghai, and the reorganization of reorganizations, in order to go out of the difficult situation and take every step of the future, we must adhere to the original intention of the ""people first"", rely on the people, gratitude to the people's dedication, listen to the people's voice Make good use of the power of the people.

As a designated hospital at a copid-19-infected patient, the South Hospital of Renji Hospital opened on April 7. On April 18, I led the severe team to the South Court. On the same day, the ICU began to run. Soon, the number of patients who needed to enter ICUs rose rapidly. From 20 beds in one ICU unit to 38 beds to 2 ICU units, and prepare to open the third ICU unit. The expansion of the ICU bed means the increase in the number of patients with the majority of patients, and it also means that the implementation of the ninth edition guidelines has increased. Guidelines require that patients with heavy and harsh types need to treat ICUs to improve the success rate of treatment. But from another perspective, the increase in ICU beds also means that the number of medical staff needs to be increased. The hospital overcome difficulties and quickly mobilize personnel and related equipment to ensure the orderly and high -quality operation of the ICU. Since the official operation of the ICU, there have been 94 patients, including 30 hazardous heavy types, 49 cases, and 15 cases. Among them, more than 80%are elderly patients, and 40%are elderly patients over 80 years old. What impressed me most was a 26 -year -old girl, Zheng Junhua, chief commander of the new country's Bo Fang Card and Secretary of the Party Committee of Renji Hospital, if it was not discovered in time, transferred and treated in time, maybe Shanghai would have one more youngest. Death patients. On April 15th, the girl was transferred to the New State Bobe Class Hospital for centralized control and treatment due to the positive nucleic acid. She is healthy and has no basic medical history, but she has not vaccinated. During the treatment of the square cabin, her emotions were negative, drinking only water and a little liquid daily. On the 28th, when a doctor inspected the square, she found that she had a bad breathing state, and immediately checked and analyzed to determine that she might have keto acid poisoning. When the girl was sent to the ICU, it should not be called, and the blood pressure decreased. After the examination, it was confirmed that she had ketoic acid poisoning, accompanied by severe metabolic acid poisoning, hypotension, severe hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. After 48 hours of continuous treatment, the girl became stable, she was able to answer soberly, and eventually was discharged smoothly. Recently, there are fewer and fewer patients who need to enter the ICU, and fewer and fewer patients in ICUs have become less and less. I believe that the victory of the ""Great Shanghai Defense War"" will soon come. My ICU team also looks forward to the ICU can close the cabin as soon as possible.

Space,Tribute to all frontline personnel,Space,"Deputy Dean of Chen Erzhen Ruijin Hospital, the leader of the Shanghai centralized isolation point medical treatment team, the head of the National Exhibition Center (Shanghai) Fang Counted Hospital Medical Service Guarantee Team, I am deeply being dedicated to these different industries, but the same dedicated comrades Touched. They are the heroes behind the scenes silently! I would like to thank all the company personnel who participated in all parts of the cabins. Many people only know that fighting COVID-19 is the job of medical staff, but in fact, in the square cabin, all logistics support personnel, like our medical staff, wear thick protective clothing to shuttle in the cabin, and do a lot of physical work. They usually do it. They usually do. They are all white -collar workers, but when the epidemic arrives, they retrograde and defend their hometown. Their work is sometimes harder than medical staff. When our Ruijin Hospital's management team worked at the National Exhibition Center, that is, the four -leaf grass square cabin worked, it worked with Jiushi Group, Shanghai Real Estate Corporation and Donghao Lan Sheng team for more than 50 days. Each of their companies is responsible for the comprehensive guarantee work system of material supply, engineering maintenance, environmental cleaning, catering guarantee, and safety management. After more than a month, each company will distribute meals and material support for nearly 10 million copies. The Qingyun medical waste reached thousands of tons, which effectively guaranteed the normal operation and safety of the world's largest square cabin, demonstrated the responsibility of state -owned enterprises to facilitate difficulties, and employees' sense of mission and dedication. When sending away a group of COVID-19 patients who recovered, they are as happy and proud as our medical staff, because this is also the result of all the guarantee service personnel who go all out and work hard day and hard work. As a square pioneering team, we participate in time when each square cabin starts. Remember that every time I propose that a certain detail may affect the safety of the patient, or cause inconvenience to the patient. Well, they did not hesitate, immediately started to work, and completed their goals every day. I am deeply moved by these different industries, but the same dedicated comrades. They are the heroes behind the scenes silently! We will give a lofty respect to all the logistics support service staff who fought on the front line!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T12.htm,6/1/22,T12 Version: Special issue,
