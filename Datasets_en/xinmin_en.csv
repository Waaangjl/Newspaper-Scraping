I didn't take a good rest overnight. Vegetables, etc., also donate vegetables from the cafeteria. The elderly cafeteria of Pengpu Town will give meals more than 600 elderly people in the town every day. Recently, Yonghe Home and other communities have accepted closed isolation or closed -loop nucleic acid screening. Many elderly people have been accepted. Many elderly people I am worried about whether I can eat lunch on time. ""The community is closed again, and the elderly can not delay for meals. ""Pu Shan Public Welfare Service Center is closely linked to the relevant neighborhood committees and community volunteers, and efficient linkage.

""Police Fan Xiaobin sent a hot meal for the old man, Wu Aunt Wu, and told a few more words again. After Shanghai launched a new round of block and grid nucleic acid screening, the area under the jurisdiction of the Xiangzhou Road Police Station of Jinshan Public Security Bureau met. There are problems. There are more than 20,000 elderly people over 60 years old, accounting for more than 52%of the total, and more than 1,800 elderly people who live alone in the elderly. For residential communities with severe aging, the police station decides to send police officers to settle in, and community workers with community workers Let's implement various emergency guarantees and people's livelihood security measures together to solve problems such as difficulty in eating, medical treatment, and help difficulties in the empty nest. After the sealing of the community on March 28, the police Fan Xiaobin first thought of the elderly in the community. I will use smartphones to buy food online, and I usually give dishes once a few days.

The community police, Qiu Xiao, was worried that the old man Guo Guo, who lived in the district, was difficult to participate in nucleic acid testing and rushed to the elderly immediately. I heard that Qiu Xiao will be relieved after escorting all the way. Qiu Xiao first helped the old man to make a screenshot on the mobile phone, and then pushed the wheelchair to the test point. After completing the sample, he escorted the old man home. In just one morning, Qiu Xiao escorted his legs and feet. The elderly have participated in nucleic acid testing more than ten times.

"I did n’t go home for more than ten days, and worked for more than 12 hours a day",“Police“ Police ”across the river,Space,"Chief reporter Pan Gaofeng ""Thank you so much, you helped us busy, and you want you to put money. We are really embarrassed."" This is the third time I thanked Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, who lives in the Linyi Building of Dongfang Road. But she was pushed back. Lin Weibin is a community police at the South Pier Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Pudong New District. Since the occurrence of the epidemic, he has been fighting the front line of resistance. Until yesterday, he hadn't returned home for more than ten days. On March 30, Lin Weibin, who maintained order at the nucleic acid detection point, met Aunt Dong's family. ""At that time, she looked particularly anxious and helpless. Mr. Ge, her husband, had been anxiously saying something. I felt that something would be something, so I went to ask."" Seeing Lin Weibin, Aunt Dong, 63, was overjoyed. ""Police Officer Lin, our children's medicine has been broken for more than half a month. I think he is a bit wrong, it is really anxious."" Lin Weibin stunned. Looking at Xiao Ge behind Aunt Dong, he found that his eyes were really manic. Xiao Ge is a psychiatric patient. Every month, his parents took him to the Shanghai Mental Health Center on No. 600, Wuxing Ping South Road, Puxi to see a doctor, and the condition has been well controlled. But since this epidemic, because of continuously being closed at home, the medicine has been taken for a long time. With Pudong Puxi promoted a new round of grid -based ribinic acid screening, cross -strait traffic interruption, and the distribution of medicines became a difficult problem. Aunt Dong and her husband were very worried about this. ""You do nucleic acids first, go back to the medical insurance card to give me a way, I come to find a way."" Lin Weibin comforted and reported to the police station immediately. After receiving the consent of the sub -bureau, he decided to run a trip to help Xiaoge with medicine. Lin Weibin did not set off immediately. He found several other neighborhood committees he had jurisdictionary and asked about the medication of mental patients. He found that there were still two cases of drug breaks. He also came to ask the medical insurance card. In order not to delay participation in nucleic acid testing, at noon that day, Lin Weibin drove to Wanping South Road without eating meals. With the help of a volunteer of the Municipal Commercial Committee, he contacted the hospital. Aunt Dong did not give enough money. He also paid for his own pocket and cooked the money to help Xiaoge with good medicine. However, the other two patients did not have seen a doctor at the Shanghai Mental Health Center before, and could not prescribe medicine according to regulations. Lin Weibin rushed back again, and inquired that they were usually seeing a doctor at the Pudong Yuandong Mental Health Center, and hurriedly drove over, finished the medicine, and delivered them one by one. When things were resolved, Lin Weibin was relieved. Aunt Dong's family was grateful and found that Lin Weibin also helped put the medicine money. He found Lin Weibin three times and wanted to return the money to him. This appeared at the beginning of the article. ""For the community police, it is also internal affairs to control the mental patient."" Lin Weibin told reporters that under the epidemic, many things that happened at all happened. ""It's hard to everyone. If you help, you can win a little more understanding and support."" In fact, ""difficult"" is Lin Weibin himself. On March 22, he was maintaining order at the nucleic acid detection point and suddenly received a notice. His community found a confirmed case and was about to be closed. The leader knew that Lin Weibin's wife was a doctor at Puonan Hospital. The child was in the third year of high school this year and did not order death. He made him decide whether to go home or stay in the front line. At that time, Lin Weibin called his wife. The wife was on duty and never answered. Hesitating again and again, he decided to last. ""It's not easy, you can do more or do more."" He hurried home, took two sets of clothes to change, and explained a few words with his son, and rushed back to the police station. Since then, he has been sleeping at the police station and never returned home. On the afternoon of March 30, Lin Weibin, who was busy after the community nucleic acid detection, was preparing to return to the police station. Suddenly discovered that 3 medical workers who had done nucleic acid testing in the community were running on the road. Catch it back and return without merit. He hurried up and asked what could help. It turned out that the three were nurses of the Oriental Hospital. Before wearing ""big white"" as nucleic acid that morning, they put the replaced clothes and three medical PDAs in a bag. Unexpectedly, the cleaner who received medical waste was not noticed, and it was taken away as a garbage bag. There are data scanning data in the three PDAs, and it is very valuable, and the three nurses have broken. Lin Weibin decided to help. He found that the nearby medical waste garbage was dispatched to dispose of the special disposal point to the West West Road of Pushan Road, and immediately drove the nurses and rushed over. At the scene, everyone couldn't help but take a breath: each garbage bag was piled up like hills. When will this be found? As Lin Weibin comforted everyone, he found the staff and asked what was the latest garbage, and then took the nurses to find a garbage bag and a garbage bag. After turning more than 30 garbage bags, nothing was obtained. At this time, a new car was transported. Lin Weibin asked the driver carefully and found that it was very likely that it was very likely to lose things on this car. Sure enough, after more than ten garbage bags, the clothes and the lost PDA of the nurse were among them! After the disinfecting, Lin Weibin sent the nurse back to the hospital again, so that he could eat something. ""In fact, there will be a lot of such things every day, helping the patients with medicine, sending the elderly for blood transmissions, and buying vegetables for residents ..."" Lin Weibin told reporters that these days, he gets up at 5 o'clock every day and send colleagues one by one to one by one to one by one. After ordering, I returned to the jurisdiction of the community and worked for more than 12 hours a day. Fight continuously. ""But who is not tired? None of the community workers and doctors and nurses I saw."" Lin Weibin said that he was a veteran, and he was transferred to the community police after retiring. ""Back to the place yesterday, with tea replacement, to celebrate the video of a few comrades -in -arms who had just lifted the isolation. Everyone was encouraging and said that I was good.""",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-01/8.htm,4/1/22,8th edition: Shanghai News,,True
Closed -loop epidemic prevention measures are intertwined with emergency surgery to save compatriots' eyes,"""Bright Relay"" more than 10,000 miles",Space,"Last night, the emergency mechanism under the emergency start of the epidemic prevention and control of the Eye, Ear and Nose and Earmine Hospital affiliated to the Fudan University had performed eye surgery for a patient with a retina that returned from the African Congo (cloth) to go back to China to help patients restore the light. The 38 -year -old patient was a Chinese crew working at the Congo (cloth) fishery company. He was wounded with a bomb -eye when unloading at the pier more than a month ago, and his left eye discomfort immediately appeared. Patients diagnosed the left -eye -based retinal disconnection in the Congo (Bud) capital Brazville's Zhonggang Friendship Hospital. Due to the limited local medical conditions, the hospital suggested that they return to China as soon as possible for surgery. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic reasons, according to the isolation requirements of international flights, the patient accepted a 21-day quarantine in the Congo (Bu), and Sia Baba, who transferred to Ethiosia for 8 days. In the end, the patient boarded a return flight with the help of a local diplomatic agency in China. In accordance with the requirements of domestic epidemic control, overseas returnees still need to continue to beolate after entering the country. During the isolation, the symptoms of patients gradually increased, and obvious visual decline and visual deformation began to occur. To his heart, during the isolation, the Shanghai epidemic was worsened. However, what the patient did not expect was that after he released the need for medical treatment on the social platform, the Jiading Health and Health Committee responded as soon as possible, and coordinated by the Municipal Health and Health Commission, and arranged to be treated by the Eye, Earmark Hospital affiliated to Fudan University. At a severe time of the epidemic, we must grasp the epidemic prevention, abide by the country's isolation principles for returning people, and ensure the patient's medical needs in a timely and effective manner.

Li Qiang pointed out that the most important stage in the most vigorous prevention and control of the epidemic must be firm and uncomfortable. It is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and instructions, and go all out, do our best, and do this round of nucleic acid screening. , Strive to ensure the safety of citizens and the safety of the city. The second batch of regional nucleic acid screening work will be fully carried out on April 1, involving more personnel and wider coverage. In order to ensure the strong and orderly advancement of nucleic acid screening, relevant districts have paid close attention to the preparations of the seal control screening. Li Qiang came to a community on the South Dandan Road, Xujiahui Street, Xuhui District to check the closed management situation of the community, listened to the work reports such as residents' nucleic acid screening organization and people's livelihood security during the sealing control period, and inquire about the emergency medical ""green channel"" and personnel equipment situation. The cadres, medical staff, public security police, property security personnel, and community volunteers who adhere to the front line expressed condolences and thanks. He said that it is necessary to combine regional reality, more targeted deployment, refining the plan, and ensuring protection. It is necessary to make good use of big data, but also ""knock"" by households to ensure that nucleic acid screening is ""not leaking one household, not one person"". It is necessary to strictly control the management, control each building, patrol and every street, and ensure that the requirements of ""people are not flowing and not leaving the house"" are implemented. It is necessary to make full service guarantees, listen carefully to the residents' voices, solve the problem of urgency in a timely manner, and better consolidate the strong joint force of everyone's self -discipline and resistance. In order to speed up the detection speed of nucleic acid, a group of mobile nucleic acid detection vehicles have been put into use a few days ago. Li Qiang came to a neighborhood square in Jing'an District to learn about the surrounding residents of the mobile nucleic acid detection vehicle service, carried out the relevant situation of nucleic acid detection, and listened to the report on the improvement of the regional nucleic acid detection capacity to improve the relevant work. Li Qiang pointed out that the detection capacity of nucleic acid testing is related to the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention and control. It is necessary to focus on the current optimization of the organization, to reasonably allocate resources, promote the collaboration of the full process of ""collection, delivery, inspection, and reporting"", promote accurate matching and efficient operation; In the long run, we have worked more from the aspects of layout, equipment procurement, qualification approval, and training personnel training, and strongly support the development of relevant testing enterprises, laying a solid foundation for the convenience of citizens with the inspection. In the past few days, the brothers and cities have given strong support at a critical moment when the new round of nucleic acid screening work is promoted by the city. The testing teams of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places have arrived in Shanghai one after another. They could not take care of more, and they immediately put them into the nucleic acid sampling testing of the relevant communities. Li Qiang visited the comrades and representatives of medical staff on the spot. On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and the city, the people of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang and Anhui testing teams did not spare no effort and support for the inspection team of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. He said that in the face of the severe challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, the brothers and cities took the initiative to docking, close collaboration, watched assistance, joint defense and control, which fully demonstrated the deep friendship of the people of Shanghai. I believe that with the strength of the Yangtze River Delta and the provinces and cities across the country, we will be able to win the resistance and control of the epidemic. Li Qiang told the district and the street comrades to further strengthen the docking, communicate closely, and do a good job of service guarantee for supporting teams in other provinces and cities with their hearts and thoughtfulness. In recent days, our city has continued to strengthen the ""non -necessary non -leaving Shanghai"". From 00:00 on April 2, in addition to 48 hours of kernel acid test negative proof of kernel testing, the personnel from Shanghai must also provide anti -antigen detection negative certificates within 24 hours. City leaders came to Shanghai Railway Station to check railway operations and bus protection, understand the inspection of nucleic acids and antigen test results from Shanghai, visit the first -tier personnel of railway operations and transportation guarantee, and comrades who continue to fight on various fronts in cities Express thankfulness.

The city leaders also went to Huangpu District to inspect the social facial control and inspect the prevention and control of the epidemic and the progress of nucleic acid screening. They made a specific understanding of the completion of local conditions and comprehensive prevention and control measures to ensure that nucleic acid screening was completed on time and quality. Li Qiang pointed out that the development of nucleic acid screening is to find out the bottom number, lock risk, and cut off the spread at the fastest speed. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the grass -roots party organization's fighting fortress and the pioneering model of party members, better act on the front line of resistance, unite and lead the residents and the masses, and resolutely win the big battle of the epidemic prevention and control. Gong Zheng came to Meituan to buy Caikang Road Station. There was a bag of vegetables stacked here.

Residents maintained interval, protecting them, and orderly nucleic acid sampling in an orderly manner. Gong Zheng looked at it and listened to the on -site organizational plan. He pointed out that the solid nucleic acid screening is related to the global resistance. It is necessary to continue to optimize on -site organizations, ensure time and time, reduce queuing time, avoid gathering conversations, and strictly prevent cross -infection. The ""easy -to -detection"" group should be included in territorial management, and the inspection should be inspected. The city leaders also came to the construction of a construction isolation and treatment point in Putuo District, and inspected the construction on the spot. Gong Zheng pointed out that it is necessary to dig up the renovation to ensure quality and safety, put it into use as soon as possible, and ensure that those with positive infections are transferred in time.

"Adult infection is transferred, who will take care of the child?","""Children's Supervisor"" and ""Children's Director"" are online",Space,"During the closing of the community, we need to strengthen care and care for special groups. How to care for the elderly and people who are in trouble for lonely widows? If the adults in the family are infected and treated, who will take care of the children of the minor? Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said that Shanghai is a city with a high degree of aging. Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, the care and service guarantee of special groups such as the elderly in the community is the top priority of our work. Recently, civil affairs departments, streets, and village commissions at all levels are also trying to do a good job of service guarantee for the special community. For elderly people who live alone, live alone, and have inconvenient actions, the community contacts the situation through telephone WeChat and other methods to understand the situation, help the elderly carry out nucleic acid test registration, and assist meals and distribution of living materials. Many ""old partner plan"" volunteers and pairing care objects pass a phone call every day to provide care and care through ""remote companion"". At the same time, for some rigid demands of the elderly in the community during the management period, such as food assistance, home care, etc., we require street towns and service agencies to do their best to provide services under the premise of strict implementation of protective measures. In addition, many districts play the dynamic information of the elderly consultant service network, timely grasp the dynamic information of groups such as elderly alone, and use the ""one -click"" information platform for the ""service for the old"" to accept the call of the elderly and their families for 24 hours. For elderly people with special requirements or difficulties, the corresponding neighborhood committees or relevant departments are coordinated and resolved. Temporary custody of children caused by the epidemic is indeed a disturbing problem. Once an adult is infected and transferred to the treatment of the epidemic, or the epidemic sealing management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them, we ask for the ""Children's Supervisor"" in the town where the children are located and the ""Children's Director"" in the village where the children are located quickly responded to Saving children's physical and mental safety as the first principle, quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. For minors suitable for home, assist in determining the appropriate caregiver and arranging temporary life care measures as soon as possible. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign special personnel to take care of them to ensure that the child is in a state of effective monitoring.

In the five venues of the district, a new round of engineering acceptance and transmission and infrastructure engineering guidance are carried out. At the same time, check the office and rest places for medical staff. ""Safety is the primary. Engineering safety, hospital sense prevention and control, personnel safety, including medical care, patients, and engineering construction personnel must ensure safety. Although tight time, difficulty, and heavy tasks, they must be sloppy. The plan is meticulous, and the work must be implemented. ""Chen Erzhen reminded all parties repeatedly. During dinner, Chen Erzhen accepted an exclusive interview with this reporter, and introduced the medical treatment and treatment plan of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered. Question: What is the treatment force of the New International Expo Center to centrally isolated and centered points? What is the condition of the ward that has been treated? Answer: As of now, the operation of this episode is generally stable. The Shanghai New International Expo Center was officially opened on the evening of March 31. Medical staff accepted the first batch of patients overnight. Under the guarantee of multi -party, the medical team of Shanghai Sixth and Tenth People's Hospital, which is stationed in the two venues of N4 and N5, accepted the ambulance that arrived at the isolation and treatment point. As of 19:00 on April 1, the venue was treated from various districts in Shanghai. 1500 patients in the county. Under the premise of ensuring the safety of patients, we are also convenient for patients. The medical team optimizes the treatment process and pays attention to details. Specifically, the ambulance that arrived at the treatment point did not line up, but the medical team took the initiative to welcome it. The medical team settled the patient first, and then handled the confirmation of relevant information. Therefore, patients are basically satisfactory. At the same time, we ask the medical team to create conditions as much as possible to meet the patient's life. Many people arrived in the middle of the night yesterday, and the treatment point also prepared rice cakes, bread and snacks for them. We also prepared a spiritual ""food"" for patients. Yesterday, the 3,000 Xinmin Evening News also sent it to the New International Expo Center to centrally isolate and collect points. So until now, patients are more recognized in all aspects. Next, the centralized isolation and treatment points of the Xin International Expo Center will steadily advance, and truly achieve the basic principles of ""separate"" and ""acceptance of acceptance"". Question: There are more than 15,000 design beds in the new International Expo Center. It is currently the largest centralized isolation point in Shanghai. What difficulties and challenges do this bring to management and operation? Answer: The site of the treatment point is very large, and the number of patients with a lot of treatment is also large. Here are including Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Longhua Hospital, Shuguang Hospital, Yueyang Hospital, Shanghai Lung Department Hospital, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Wu Guan Science Hospital, and Yangpu District Central Hospital. The medical team of ten hospitals entered, and the workload was very large. In the management of the hospital, first try to be perfect in hardware construction, and meet the equipment requirements, process requirements and technical requirements of the hospital sense prevention and control; Personnel and volunteers, etc., should improve their understanding of the importance of the hospital through training, and also improved the sense of the hospital. Question: In medical treatment, is there any plan? How will the infected people treat it here? Answer: In terms of medical treatment, the medical teams are strictly implemented based on the ""New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)"" published by the National Health and Health Commission. During the treatment process, we will further refine the plan to meet the needs of patients. We have prepared the plan to deal with patients with basic diseases and try to meet the individualized treatment needs of patients. Most of the new International Expo Center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points are asymptomatic infections. We will give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and let the infected people take some Chinese medicine. At the same time, patients with symptoms are treated with symptomatic treatment, such as cooling down. For those infected, we will conduct nucleic acid tests on the second and third days. Once the yin is transferred to meet the discharge standards, we will go through the discharge procedures. For those with mild and asymptomatic infections, this cycle is basically 7-10 days. Question: As the chief commander at the centralized isolation and treatment point at the New International Expo Center, what is the difference between the treatment of the treatment of the Third Hospital of Wuhan two years ago? Answer: At that time, we were ""foreign aid"", and this time it was ""internal rescue"". Omikon BA.2 mutant strain spreads fast and has strong communication, which also increases the difficulty of our control. However, whether in Wuhan or Shanghai, they are fighting against the epidemic. When I was in Wuhan, I said, ""I just changed my job"", so there is nothing different from nature. Question: Before, you were also responsible for many centralized isolation and treatment points. Have you accumulated some experience and brought this isolation point? Answer: The team I led has participated in the construction at the Temporary Concentration and Creating Points of the Gymnasium, Chongming Changxing Island, Jiahe Xinyuan, and Expo Exhibition Hall. From the earliest we have slowly accumulated experience, continuously summarized experience, and also learned from others. Overall, the new international expo center temporarily centralized isolation and treatment points has the embodiment of previous experience. Of course, such a huge -scale treatment point is also very challenging to me, which has never been encountered before.

Space,Shanghai Tomorrow City will conduct nucleic acid detection in the city,Today the city will conduct an antigen test,"Wu Qianyu, a first -level inspector of the Municipal Health Commission, said that Shanghai is promoting a new round of nucleic acid screening. The main task is to thoroughly eliminate risk points, cut off the spread chain, curb the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible, and realize social dynamics as soon as possible. Based on the early nucleic acid screening, it was decided to conduct an antigen test in the city today, and will conduct nucleic acid testing in the city tomorrow. This time, a total of more than 10 million people were screened in the second batch of antigen tests in Puxi region. Some detection abnormalities were found through antigen detection, and nucleic acid testing was performed as soon as possible to effectively block virus diffusion and spread. The characteristics of antigen detection are fast speed and easy operation, and citizens can complete the test at home. The Municipal Health and Health Commission reminded that everyone should strictly follow the operation instructions and operating videos when testing. If you find that your antigen detection results are positive, please report to the village neighborhood committee and wait at home as soon as possible. The staff will arrange for you to conduct nucleic acid test review. At the same time, everyone should note that the antigen self -testing of the nose swab, sampling tube, and detection card should be packed in a sealed bag. As a result, the negative disinfection should be put into the dry trash can. The medical institutions are treated in accordance with the medical waste.

World Expo Fang Cabin Hospital sent away eligible discharge in batches today,"""I have defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!""",Space,"Cabbage, discharged! Shanghai's first COVID-19 patients with mild patients and asymptomatic infected World Exhibition Center Hospital have been running for a week. From today, the qualified discharge will be sent in order here. These courtyards will be returned to the land by various districts and strictly do health management. The infected person tells that peace of mind isolation treatment Active volunteer service on March 23. The 34 -year -old Mr. Wang's family of three and his parents were notified to receive centralized isolation observations. ""I was notified abnormally during the hospital test at the hospital. At that time, my wife, 8 -month -old child, and parents and elderly people could not be released."" I don't know how it is my turn. The unit leader called him to let him relax, do not have ideological burdens, and receive treatment with peace of mind. All units in the family will find ways to solve it. Mr. Wang was relieved, and was sent to the World Expo Card on the 26th to treat the area under the jurisdiction of the medical team of Renji Hospital. Mr. Wang is a member of the Communist Party of China. He holds the idea of ""good deeper"". He said that he had to work hard to ""turn overcast"" and return to his family as soon as possible. ""The first time to sleep with so many people is definitely not used to it, but the bed, quilt, and various living items are brand new, and the environment is relatively clean. Men, don't pay attention to so much."" Here, Mr. Wang said he said he After living a nursing home -like life, three meals a day can be delivered, and you can come again if you are not enough; if you have nothing to do, video with your family, and occasionally deal with some units' work contact matters. In the square cabin, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine was fully exerted, and he also took everyone with everyone. Except for eating, he usually wore a mask, including sleeping without taking off. ""I think everyone does this, it seems to be very common, and I am not particularly uncomfortable, just get used to it."" There is a activity area in the square cabin hospital. When the sun was exposed, the pressure was gone when the mind was empty. Mr. Wang also saw an initiative of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee from the mobile phone. He said that his party was 10 years old and his body was uncomfortable. He could stand up to serve everyone. As a result, he became an active volunteer to help nurses distribute three meals and bottled water, carry materials, and coordinate the living needs of nearby personnel. ""Da Bai wants to take care of so many people in us. It is very hard. We can help us, find something to do, and the time has passed soon."" In the area where he lives, everyone is happy to serve others. Mr. Wang Laughingly, there were several late time, and they did not grab the volunteers. They could only ""enjoy"" the services of others. The biggest difficulty is that the hardware conditions are limited. The shower facilities cannot be converted here. You can only wash it with hot water. Fortunately, washing and going to the toilet are more convenient, and they do not need to be lined up. Others are also very modest. Seeing someone in the back, I always speed up and avoid others for too long. From the beginning of the tension to the later relief, Mr. Wang said that this was the first provenance of him and the virus; and the two nucleic acid detection negatives intervals 24 hours a day was his long -awaited victory. ""I defeated the virus! I'm going to be discharged!"" Last night, he had sorted out his personal items and will be arranged by the vehicle in the area. ""I miss it home. The first thing to go back is to take a bath."" Mr. Wang thanked the Renji Medical Team who took care of him. He said that the family members are currently nucleic acid detection negative and everything is good. Looking at it, each experience has harvested, and the special ""collective life"" is also a different experience. The chief commander tells the difficulties that we have worked together to work together in the World Expo Hospital where Mr. Wang is located. As of yesterday, more than 7,100 mild patients and asymptomatic infections were accepted. Ji Hospital, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Tongji Hospital, Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, and Shanghai Children's Medical Center. The interim party committee and temporary party branch have been established here. Zheng Junhua, chief commander of the World Cabin Hospital and Secretary of the Party Committee of Renji Hospital, told reporters that according to the characteristics of the mutant strains of Omiko, most people can transfer to the yin to go home after 7 to 10 days. Starting today, those who meet the discharge standards will be discharged in batches and districts. ""We have strictly compared one by one in accordance with national standards. It requires two negative interval time for nucleic acid to require more than 24 hours. For three consecutive days of body temperature, there is no symptoms of respiratory tract. In the end, we set the first list."" The personnel are involved in multiple districts in the city. They have completed docking and confirmed with various districts yesterday. These personnel are managed by the territory and coordinated by the territorial coordinated vehicles to take them back properly. In terms of discharge management, the Shanghai Municipal Government has established a comprehensive coordination of special classes. If the residence meets the home isolation conditions, it can carry out 7 days of health management at home; if the family's own conditions do not have it, the accommodation arrangement will be implemented by the local area. As these groups of personnel have left one after another, completing the disinfecting work, a group of new personnel will be ushered in. Zheng Junhua said that the first time to set up a square -cabin hospital infected in Shanghai for the first time, it is completely different with the scene where he took the city's first support for the Hubei medical team to Wuhan in 2020, so this time you can only improve while doing it. From the beginning, it can be improved. From the beginning The running -in period, when the improvement period, and reaching the improvement period, cannot be separated from the joint efforts of everyone. At the same time, the medical needs and life needs of more than 7,000 people are facing very large pressure. ""It is definitely better to stay at home, and it will always exist."" Zheng Junhua hopes to tell everyone that isolation is temporary. As long as everyone can cooperate with the prevention and control strategy and respond positively and optimistic, they can soon go home.

Space,"Inspiration is constantly ""resistant to episodes"" bright moves",Space,"Yesterday, our reporter from the ""New 36 Anti -Epidemic 36 Plan"" collected by the city's anti -epidemic front -line was published, which brought new ""inspiration"" to many first -tier anti -epidemic workers. They were practical tricks. Today, let's take a look at what they have. The 7th ""Artifact"" QR code ""Batch generation"" is in Dongqi Village, Lingtang Town, Qingpu District, and nearly two -thirds of the villagers are elderly people over 60 years old. They are not good at using smart devices and need staff to help enter healthy cloud nucleic acid registration information. In order to improve efficiency, the ""post -90s"" guy Li Sichun thought of a good way -he used his professional learning to write a two -dimensional code batch of appointments based on the population information table. Each person's appointment registration information only takes 40 seconds You can generate up to 100 pieces at most, which is not only efficient, but also avoids the problem that the elderly's information may be errors in the village committee staff. Using this program, only one staff member, plus three computers can operate at the same time, can generate more than 1,400 appointment codes in the village within 5 hours. At present, nearly a hundred villages in Qingpu, Jiading, Minhang, Pudong and other areas have also begun to use this program, which greatly improves the efficiency of nucleic acid screening information registration. Our reporter Yang Huan No. 8 Before the ""dark box"" was simplified, how to quickly scan the appointment of the nucleic acid detection and register the two -dimensional code before the ""dark box"" was checked by the ""dark box""? Yesterday, the reporter found in the Green Home District of Jinhui Town, Fengxian District that the nucleic acid testing team here uses a homemade ""dark box"". This ""dark box"" is a rectangular ""sunroof"" cut out of the top, and a convenient noodle box on the side is cut around. In the bright spring light, the residents stretched the mobile phone from the side of the cut, and as the volunteer scanned the terminal with the hand -scan terminal, they could be retrieved. According to the volunteers at the scene, this ""dark box"" was made a few days ago. Prior to this, they found that although most residents took screenshots in advance and registered the QR code of nucleic acid testing, when the light outside was too strong, the screen of the mobile phone was relatively dark. The QR code on the screen was not easily scanned by the terminal-- Sometimes it takes more than ten consecutive times to succeed. And such a self -made ""dark box"", the light inside is not as strong as the outside. This is much bright in the mobile phone screen in it. In order to adjust the light in the ""dark box"" to a better level, and to better check the handheld terminal screen, they also gave a ""dark box"" and a handheld terminal. They said that now they are basically accurate, fast and safe. Our reporter Luo Shuiyuan's 9th efficient bright code brush ID card as a nucleic acid. According to the proposal made by the citizens through the public adoption of the ""Special Solid in the Epidemic Prevention and Control Work"" channel, the citizens will not operate the elderly in the nucleic acid detection. The prominent problem of dilemma, Jiangpu Road Street, Yangpu District contacted a technology company to emergency research and development, and draw on the practice of brushing ID cards at the high -speed rail station to enter the station to drive. Essence ""Intelligent nuclear detection"" looks like a POS machine. As long as the elderly put the ID card, the device can intelligently recognize it, and automatically access the ""Healthy Cloud"" applet to generate a two -dimensional code for nucleic acid testing and printed. Jiangpu Road Street has piloted in several communities, which is very convenient for the elderly and has accelerated the speed of nucleic acid detection. After that, the street will continue to optimize the network stability of the device to promote this practice larger. Our reporter Sun Yun's 10th ""magic box"" emergency material faction field in the past few days, in the Pushan residential area of Jijiangxi Road Street, Jing'an District, a suitcase called ""Baibao Box"" is a bit busy: it follows The staff of the residential area ""Da Xian's skills"" came to the scene of the epidemic prevention and control again -this is the emergency of protective clothing, goggles, gloves, masks, disinfection and disinfection plants such as the deployment and requirements of the residential area according to the street deployment and requirements of the residential area. Materials, it can come in handy. It is understood that there are 7 staff members of the Pu Shan residential area, but there are 14 sets of protective suits prepared by Zhang Lei, the general branch of the residential district party -the first night of the first day of the sealing and control notification, rushed to the scene to cooperate with the seal control measures When the property company staff saw the community staff all armed, but when they had only one mask, Zhang Lei opened the trolley case and handed protective equipment to the property staff who needed to work in the building. The children of a family have a high fever and need to be sent to the hospital for treatment. The two sets of protective equipment of the ""Baibao Box"" are used again. Before 120 arrived, let the children and mothers protect them early, and they were sent to relevant hospitals for a moment. Our reporter Jiang Yuezhong's 11th anti -""leakage"" in the field of real -time form WeChat filling nucleic acid detection data can be made clear to ensure that one is not omitted? Wen Hai, a volunteer volunteer in the seaside New City Community of Shanyang Town, Jinshan District, is a teacher of the Mengshan Middle School Information Department. He summarizes the experience of previous volunteer services. He believes that the selection of this tradition will increase the work pressure of later data. Therefore, on the evening of March 29, Wen Hai used his own director to design and produce a WeChat real -time table overnight, including the community building number and room number of the community. Set the point to perform online registration. On the morning of March 30, the Eastern District of the Seaside New Town took the lead in implementing a dynamic monitoring of real -time tables. Residents find that they can open the form at home and simultaneously know the inspection progress of other corridors, which is very convenient; on -site volunteers have found that they can understand the detection status at the scene in real time to facilitate the next corridor for testing. For the volunteers of the building, this form is also very helpful, which can understand the situation of the detection site in real time, and facilitate dynamic adjustment of the scanning speed. The cadres of the neighborhood committee also believe that this real -time data can greatly improve the work efficiency of the presidential plan. The newspaper correspondent Liu Shihan Reporter Tu Yu's 12 ""Flowing Water"" combat hand -painted ""sampling process"" Tu Minhang District Maqiao Town Party Committee Qi Yuanyuan constantly explored and handed 6 sampling flowcharts, which clearly marked the sampling moving line, Each link and corresponding functions and precautions. Staff can rank according to the figure and perform their duties, so that the samples are as efficient and smooth as the ""flow line"". According to the flowchart, in terms of personnel configuration, it is usually configured with 2-3 volunteers in one station. Medical staff is only responsible for sampling links. Other codes scanning, cotton-dismantling, and samples are put into test tubes. — Relevant volunteers receive standardized training in the early stage. One process and 1 person are completed. At one time, it can save almost 2-3 seconds, one or two thousand copies a day, and the time to save is considerable. 70 medical staff can complete the sampling volume of 50,000 people in one day. According to the flowchart, the Xia Duoyuan community in Maqiao Town also created its own ""hand shape"" moving line, that is, the orderly arrangement of residents to queue in the ""arm"" in batches, and arrange volunteers to scan the code to verify it at the ""wrist"". Subsequently diverted to the ""fingers"" at the ""finger"" to complete the test before leaving, avoiding entry and exit flowing, preventing personnel agglomeration, and improving the sampling efficiency. After the closed -loop management of Judura, many young volunteers took the initiative to report to the residential village committee. They were arranged in the QR code verification area to perform mobile phone operations for residents who did not register, and scanned the code for the registered residents to ensure that 10 people in the testing team quickly turned around. Volunteers also DIY the shading carton to avoid the failure of the mobile phone to scan the mobile phone due to sunlight.

The 10 -year -old girl at home was always at home because of her negativeness. After seeing the video, send the information for ""helping Nong"". After receiving the help, the reporter contacted the girl's parents and neighborhood committees. ""The news is not real. Although both of our husband and wife are isolated, the school and the neighborhood committee have always been concerned about their children."" The emotional at home is low. ""Chen Chen is indeed alone at home."" Essence Girl Dad, Mr. Wang, told reporters that because the couple were diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, they had been collected uniformly on March 28. If they took the child to focus on the treatment point, they were worried that the child would be infected. Therefore, only the daughter was at home. Mr. Wang said: ""Because the parents are not around, and because of worrying about her infection, her daughter has really been a bit low in these days. However, the description in the video is inaccurate. A lot of it. ""The netizens who asked"" helping Nong ""also called the reporter to call the reporter. When he contacted the Douyin account on the 1st to ask about the situation, the Douyin account said solved. In order to further understand the situation every day, the reporter contacted Chen Chen's class teacher Dai. ""She is usually a well -behaved and sensible child."" Teacher Dai told reporters that since the girl's parental nucleic acid detection is abnormal, she maintains communication with her children every day. When her parents were not sent to the concentrated collection point, she and her parents were separated by two bedrooms. I followed up to understand the changes in my family every day. Starting this Monday, her parents left home. I will talk to her on WeChat every day, or ask audio calls to ask her needs and mood. Last week, her antigen self -test was positive, but she was tense. Fortunately, the result of nucleic acid review detection is negative. ""The reporter also learned from the neighborhood committee where Chen Chen's family was located that since Chen Chen's parents were sent to centralized isolation, Chenchen was included in the community's focus on the target of concern."" The 10 -year -old girl is alone at home, plus due to the entire building. They are all closed and managed, and we are also worried about her safety and worry about whether she can take care of himself. ""Teacher Tang, the person in charge of the neighborhood committee, said that on the one hand, the staff of the neighborhood committee communicated with Chenchen through WeChat every day to ask Chenchen's needs. In order to let Chen Chen and Chen Chen's parents feel at ease, a few days ago, they also contacted the professionals to come to do the home environment. ""Thank you for the neighborhood committee and the school, thanks to their care. ""Chen Chen's father, who is still in the isolation point, told the reporter on the phone. At the press conference of the 141st COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in Shanghai held yesterday, Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, emphasized that the epidemic situation emphasized that It may lead to temporary care of children. Once adults are infected and transferred, or the epidemic seal control management cannot go home, causing unmanned children to take care of them. Children's director ""responded quickly to ensure the physical and mental safety of the child as the first principle, and quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services. If it is a minor suitable for home, to assist in determining the appropriate caregiver as soon as possible and arrange temporary care measures. If it is difficult to find the right caregiver for a while, the children's district and street and towns should implement the responsibility of the first time. Under the premise of the parents' consent, they will assign a special person to take care of it to ensure that the child is in an effective monitoring state. Both parents like Chenchen COVID-19 have only one family who has been trapped away. Teacher Tang said that because Chenchen is the secret of positive patients, in the past two days, the town is also coordinating whether Chenchen can be transferred to the town to transfer to the town. There is a close -up isolation point for special personnel, and there is finally news on April 1. ""There is an isolation point for Chen Chen. If Chen Chen was unwilling to go to the isolation point, the street also applied for Dabai special care, and she could come to care and take care of her. In addition, the neighborhood committee also coordinated a doctor to adopt a nucleic acid for Chenchen to help her relieve her tension. ""However, as of the press time, Chen Chen's parents were not adapted because their daughters were not adapted to the strange environment, and they were worried that the strange Dabai special care came to the door to cause the child to be nervous.

Shanghai Police reminds: citizens shall cooperate with nucleic acid sampling detection,Uncontrolled inspection will be handled according to law,Space,"On the morning of April 1st, a scene occurred in a community in Songjiang District: According to the unified arrangement of the street, the residents organized residents to conduct nucleic acid testing. Because of the trouble of trouble, the resident Yan Mou turned a blind eye to the detection notification, but the door was closed. Essence When the staff came to the door many times, Yan came to the scene, but deliberately presented the two -dimensional code of the WeChat business card to the sampling person. When he was asked to show the healthy cloud QR code, he forcibly broke through the staff to stop the staff and returned home by himself. It seriously affects the normal development of the testing work. After receiving the alarm, the police of the Songjiang Public Security Branch rushed to the scene to deal with it, urging Yan Mou to take the investigation after completing the nucleic acid test, and recently imposed administrative penalties for it according to law. In fact, on March 27, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government issued the ""Notice on Doing a Good Affairs of the City in the City"", and carried out a new round of cut -type and grid nucleic acid screening in the city. The general public is required to support understanding and cooperation with the city's epidemic prevention and control work. In accordance with the requirements of the street community or unit of the street, the nucleic acid screening is orderly. For the test of nucleic acid testing for unified organizations without justified reasons, which hinders the prevention and control of the epidemic or cause other serious consequences, the Shanghai Public Security Organ will give public security management punishment in accordance with the relevant provisions of the People's Republic of China on Public Security Management Punishment of the People's Republic of China; if a crime constitutes a crime, in accordance with "" The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China is investigated for criminal responsibility.

Space,Very friendly neighbors,Space,"Wu Yue dusk, the ringtone sounded, and I glanced at the screen of the mobile phone, which was called by the neighbor ""Mr. Yu"". A sense of instinctual tension spreads from the heart. Mr. Yu is a good -tempered man. There is a beautiful wife and two smart and lively boys. On the day of the new home, I led my daughter to introduce myself. They politely asked us to chat in the living room. When we resigned, we added WeChat, and his net name was ""fish"". Since then, sometimes I met my children at the door of the elevator when I was sent to school in the morning, and sometimes I met under the sidewalk tree when I picked up the child from school. In fact, I rented the two -bedrooms in this urban area, and only lived on Monday to Friday. On Friday night, we returned to the home of the suburbs and drove to the past on Sunday evening. This cycle has been returning for a few months. WeChat chat dialog box is almost blank. A few days ago, primary and secondary school students in Shanghai began to study at home. There were relatively large TVs in the suburbs, which were more suitable for online classes. Before leaving, I simply packed the textbook and thought it would come back in a few days. Now, the sudden call of Mr. Yu, a neighbor, seems to indicate some accidents. ""Your home is leaking. It may be that the water pipe bursts. Come back and take a look. The water flows out of the room and flows to the public corridor."" Mr. Yu said anxiously. He asked me if I had the key, and the property could come in to help me close the faucet. Coincidentally, the spare keys of the door lock are in my parents 'house, and their parents' houses are nearby, but their communities are being managed in a closed -loop at this time, and they can't get out. ""We rush over now."" I was ready to move immediately. Mr. Yu paused at the end of the phone, ""Then you have to be prepared. Our building also announced a closed loop an hour ago. The water over there is flowing out, and it is impossible to prepare things that the whole family moves back in a few minutes. When I discussed with my husband, I decided to take a look. It was dinner time, and we couldn't care about it. We handed the children to the familiar neighbors and took a care, and they opened the accelerator to the city. Sure enough, the urban house was pulled downstairs, and the two ""big white"" guarded. On the way, I have contacted the property in the community. They have turned off the sluice outside my house, and the flowing water has been suspended. But what is the situation in the family, you can't know if you don't go in. I took a deep breath and made a video call to Mr. Yu downstairs. ""Now we can't get up, I can only ask you to enter the password to enter the door."" I know that this has added a lot of trouble to others, but Mr. Yu agreed that the two boys and his wife also appeared. Everyone was a little excited. Essence We are like a live broadcast of 20 meters across the vertical distance. We must push away the door of the mysterious shipwreck and look at the ""underwater"" world. ""Okay, now I opened the door,"" Mr. Yu said, while slowly pushing away our door, my mind turned out to the table and chairs that drifted out of the water and took my breath. ""Fortunately, there is no water in the living room, there is only the kitchen. You see, there is a deep knuckle."" Mr. Yu stepped in and found the culprit in the sound -then the dishwasher's leader into the water pipe. The faucet should be aging. At a certain time this afternoon, it bounced directly, and the fountain was generally freely waved. Until now, it is still surrounded by water after the sluice is closed. The crisis is temporarily lifted. As for the drainage and cleaning of the water, we can only wait until we will deal with it. This is a blessing in unfortunate, much smaller than the loss I expected. Mr. Yu didn't hang up. After he looked at it, he said, ""Let's help you clean it up, don't worry."" He and his wife spent an hour, using various tools to clean up all the areas of water. No matter how much thanks I say, it is not enough to express this movement, guilt and warmth. One week later, I was unblocked. I returned home and stood on the clean and dry floor tiles, feeling touched. I knocked on the neighbor's door again, ""I'm sorry, I haven't asked the surname?"" The old saying, ""Far relatives are not as good as neighbors"", this is really the case. In this very important period, the friendship of friends is also unusual. This time, we will help us take care of our children, help us call the police and clean, and help us pick up the courier, all of which are neighbors. Neighbor. Give people roses, and have a fragrance of hands.

The scale is unprecedented and unprecedented. These days, many people do nucleic acid numbness, and may not understand the meaning behind it. This is the beginning of the overall attack, the horn of decisive battle! At this moment, the people of the city must hear the order and charge in the same direction in order to get angry and win this big battle and tough battle.

After being sent to the hospital for rescue, it would never leave. Behind this is a moving fact: the outbreak of Shanghai has been outbreak for more than a month, and countless medical staff and grass -roots workers like Ji Jian have been fighting all over the world. Their pressure and fatigue are close to the limit they can withstand. Not only are the front -line staff, many Shanghai people are also exhausted. We have gone through the panic of grabbing food, the difficulties of seeing a doctor, the distress of being banned at home, the hard work and grievances of being a volunteer ... Everyone is not easy, and they all make the overall situation of resistance to the situation of resistance. I contributed to my own contribution. Because we have paid such a price, we must cherish it, we must continue to refuel, and continue to persist. If we rushed forward for ninety -nine steps, but took a step back at a critical moment, so that all the front achievements were abandoned, we could not forgive ourselves, and we could not bear serious consequences. Recently, many people have been exposed to their own gift packages in the circle of friends. They are very happy and happy. Some people are even exploring the cooking method of the dishes. This is a positive signal: the supply of materials is slowly perfecting and gradually keeping up. Behind this is Shanghai's own efforts and support from the people of the country. Yesterday, someone posted a video on Douyin, and the text said: ""Tears have fallen."" That was the long -run bus team, with a long bus team, with the cricket BGM ( Background music) is so exciting. That's the medical team that reinforced Shanghai! When the epidemic of Wuhan broke out, Shanghai was the first retrograde. Today, Shanghai is difficult, and the same support! They come from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Jiangxi, Tianjin, Hainan and other provinces. From yesterday to today, they arrived in Shanghai and quickly invested in nucleic acid testing and medical treatment. There are also Shanghai's cabin hospitals, isolation points, and designated hospitals, which are continuously increased and equipped every day to ensure that confirmation and asymptomatic cases should be received. All of this shows that the situation is facing. With our own hard work, with the support of the people of the whole country, the moment of decisive battle finally arrives! Today's city nucleic acid testing is the total attack gun. The strong infection and high concealment of Omircong's mutant strain determines at this moment that there must be a thorough full -time nucleic acid screening to find out the number of epidemics and provide data support for the next ""play method"" to support the data support. Essence The war is intelligence, and the numbers must be accurate to have reference value. This requires each of us to do our best. During this time, many people have some conflicts with nucleic acid detection. On the one hand, I was worried about being infected in the test and had fear; on the other hand, I tested so many times, a little bit of fighting emotions. These can be understood. Because of this, we must be more prepared. Medical staff and community cadres and volunteers must think more. The best and the safest processes are designed. They must sweep the building and knock on the door, look for people to ensure that there is no omissions and one. Protect, wear a mask, prepare a healthy cloud registration code, keep two meters spacing, finish quickly, go home quickly, and continue to ""not leave home"". Yesterday, a netizen proposed: After doing a good job of wearing a mask today, I would like to say thank you for the medical staff. I especially thank the medical staff in foreign aid in Shanghai. ""Please look at each other's eyes and say thank you!"" This is a very good initiative. But the real gratitude is actually full preparation and high coordination. This is the quality and tone of Shanghai people, and it is the best repayment of medical staff. Over the past month, all Shanghai people have experienced a lot and paid a lot. Those sweat and tears have become an unforgettable city memory. Some things are not persistence because of success, but because of persistence. To overcome the epidemic and hug as usual, it is the wish of everyone. Unite, keep it again! After many years, when we think of this moment, we will be proud of ourselves.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-04/2.htm,4/4/22,No. 2 Edition: Want to hear,,True

They ride ""little donkey"" or shared bicycles to come to the required point on -site service. It not only eased the pressure of medical staff, but also laid a solid foundation for the new round of nucleic acid screening work in Hongkou District, ensuring that everyone should inspect all the inspection and do not fall off one person. Our reporter Yuan Wei's century -old old city compartment promoted ""a group of 30 people, which is 2 meters apart from north to south. There are nearly 1,800 residents in the Xicheng neighborhood committee. In Xichengli, Wang Lili, who was in danger, stood on the spot to dispatch at the mouth of Nongtang. At 6 am this morning, Shanghai Xintiandi was not far from the CCP's major conference site. The residents of Xichengli walked out of the hundred -year -old litter in turn and conducted nucleic acid testing in an orderly manner in the community garden ""Dream Chasing Garden"". In the very time, a nucleic acid testing of a century -old Nongtang is the epitome of Shanghai grass -roots control resistance fighting combat effectiveness. Since March, the Xicheng community has entered a state of sealing. A few days ago, the social workers of the neighborhood committee were ""collective isolation"". At this time, Wang Lili, the ""old secretary"" of the Xicheng neighborhood committee who has been transferred to the street for three years, was ordered to lead the four social workers to support Xicheng. For a century, the old people generally do not use smartphones, and they will not be healthy and registering healthy cloud -nucleic acid. What should I do? There is a way. In contrast to the latest household registration information, temporary social workers and community volunteers check the information of the elderly one by one, and make a healthy cloud registration.

The scene was drawn with a 2 -meter line, and the villagers quietly lined up to detect the scene in an orderly manner. Because considering that the residential houses in rural areas are relatively scattered, it is inconvenient to make villagers with inconvenient moves doing nucleic acids early in the morning. Therefore, the village committee organized party members' volunteer service teams to pick up some villagers for nucleic acid testing. As a result, a small three -wheeled, private car, the elderly, pregnant women, etc. received the nucleic acid detection point. If the elderly were inconvenient to get out of the car, they asked them to sit on the car to complete the sample. For the elderly and patients who are not in bed and are not convenient to go out, the staff will come to the door for testing. As of 8:30 in the morning, 860 villagers in the village have completed nucleic acid testing. The reporter learned from Hengsha Township that starting at 5:30 am this morning, 25 villages in Hengsha Township set up 24 points in the village committee. The inspection personnel use the production team as the unit to test in batches, and adopt a 20: 1 mixing method to arrange the family and neighbors together. If the detection is abnormal, this method can be used to reduce the scope of the detection at the fastest speed. At the nucleic acid detection site, a 2 -meter queuing line and small speakers were set up to guide the villagers in an orderly test and reminded them to go home immediately after completing the test. There is only one import and export between the villages and the volunteers for 24 hours to ensure that the nucleic acid testing process is safe and orderly.

After the reporter learned of the situation, he immediately contacted the relevant hospitals to understand the case of type A blood needed by the elderly, and asked his family members to make an appointment with Shanghai Oriental Hospital in time. Subsequently, the reporter called the call of the Jinqiao Huayuan neighborhood committee where the old man in Chengcheng was located. The neighborhood committee stated that the community is currently implementing the ""2+12"" sealing management.

Space,The city samples a total of 25.665 million people,"Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control situation is extremely severe, please citizen friends to continue to cooperate with ""not leaving the house""","At 10 am this morning, the 144th COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference was held in Shanghai. Gu Honghui, deputy secretary-general of the municipal government, director of the office of the municipal epidemic prevention and control work group, Wu Qianyu, first-level inspector of the Municipal Health Commission, Shuguang Hospital Fang Min, the director of the Dean and the head of the Chinese Medicine Epidemic Prevention Base, attended the relevant situation. The city carried out rolling screening in society. Yesterday, the number of new positive infections exceeded 10,000 cases for the first time, with a total of 13,354 cases. Since March, this wave of epidemic has reported more than 73,000 positive infections. Omikon's mutant strain spreads quickly and has a strong hiddenness. At present, the Shanghai epidemic is still running at a high level, and the situation is extremely severe. In order to curb the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible and ensure the safety and physical health of the people, Shanghai launched the city's nucleic acid screening on April 4. Testing in a large city with a population of more than 25 million people is tight, heavy, and difficult, which is a test of the comprehensive capabilities of the city in Shanghai. With the strong support of the central and brothers and cities, the city's maximum daily nucleic acid detection capacity has reached 4 million pipes. A total of about 20,000 sampling points have been set up in the city, and about 50,000 sampling personnel have been organized. With the active cooperation of the general public, the city's nucleic acid sample work is generally smooth and orderly. As of 8 o'clock on April 5, the city sampled a total of 2.5665 million people and 2.427 million pipes. The detection of 1.925 million pipes was completed. The remaining samples were still being tested. Gu Honghui said that we have strengthened the connection of various links of mining, transportation, inspection, reporting, and nuclear nuclear, compressed sample transportation time, ensuring the full load operation of the detection capacity, improving the efficiency of results reporting, speeding up the positive review speed of the initial inspection , Express inspection, express report, fast core. During the large -scale sampling period, many of us have adopted multiple mixed sampling methods; for samples with abnormal detection results, we also need to check the single -handed single -handling for personnel in the sample. We are conducting re -examination and re -inspection of relevant personnel involved in the unusual results of mixed pipes. After the re -inspection is completed, accelerate the transfer of transfer isolation as the most urgent task. Once a new positive infection is discovered, it must be transferred immediately, the Japanese and the sun meets, and the acceptance is acceptable.

Space,"Battle and epidemic test room, holding everything is everything",space,"Wu Jian is destined to be a special Qingming. Due to the need for epidemic prevention, the Shanghai people stopped the pace of the tomb. At this moment, in my circle of friends, there are many posts that pin their mourning, but the tone is not depressed. It has the four words from Du Mu's ""Qingming"" ""Qingming season, pedestrian break soul; where the restaurant is? Refers to Xinghua Village"", refers to Let you make a bit of it; there are still many people who repost Su Shi's phrase ""the taste of the world is clear"", and I hope you will keep your heart at ""stopping"" in normal life. But what really touched me was Tao Zhu's phrase ""Qingming clear, the flowers of the flower walls north and south. Looking at Lingnan Spring earlier, the shade blows through the Mo Mo"", the mood is high, showing vitality. Traditional festivals are the accumulation of the history of a country. As an important component of the traditional culture of the nation, Qingming has been set by the state as a legal holiday in 2008 to form a ""little golden week"", so that people who run all year round can easily meet with their ancestors and respect their ancestors. A bite of fragrance, presenting a bouquet of flowers, to show gratitude and thinking, can also gather together, reflect the traditional connotations of spiritual ancestors, filial piety, harmony, and inheritance. However, any traditional collision, blending, and even reconciliation with the real fields will conform to social development and public interests in ""Li"" and ""Break"". Before 2020, the earliest hospital in China appeared in the Western Han Dynasty. Objectively, human experience in health and disease has always been affected by its own cultural environment. Anthropologist Dimmond pointed out that infectious diseases are closely related to human lifestyle. Modern urbanization and high population density have put forward higher requirements for public health and personal lifestyles, just like the COVID-19 epidemic that lasted more than two years, "" The protection measures of three -piece sets and five are gradually becoming a popular habit, which reflects the standards and mutual respect required in contemporary urban life. In the past two years, countless Shanghai people have accepted the suggestion of ""screening"" when the society needs, abandon temporary freedom, and do citizens who understand, support, and self -discipline. The ancestors narrowed the ceremony of ""entering the soil"", grew the affection of ""being An"", reflected the observance of the rules, the empathy of collective interests, and the tolerance and indifference of the need to sacrifice part of the freedom and convenience. ""In ancient times, the epidemic was a cemetery, a battlefield in modern times, and a test room in the contemporary era."" This sentence condenses the change of human and epidemic. The severe problem in front of everyone. At this moment, more than 10,000 medical players in Shanghai have been assisted from many places across the country, and how many of them have turned their thoughts on the deceased and turned into the boldness of the wind and the same robe. There is also a foreign friend who ""shown"" with Chinese colleagues in Shanghai with a clever answer: Oriental Qingming Festival and Western Easter holidays are closely linked. ""Both culture is full of bitterness. The way to commemorate the process of death, rebirth, and winter and spring recovers all things. For everyone living in Shanghai, holding up is everything -holding up, not to be a hero, just to be yourself. You are different, you can recognize it at a glance; if you can't hold it, don't talk about victory. "" Looking at the empty streets full of sunlight, looking at the relatives and friends who were at home, and stepped into such a quiet and clear, I could not completely drive away sadness and anxiety, but it was still hope for the mainstream. Looking back at the history of the history, the disease and human beings have been working together. We have defeated the old disease and have preventive measures. The new threats followed again. Never bow to the epidemic, there are traditional in our nation. Although from top to bottom, it is inevitable that there will be a moment of nervousness, but it is more condensed.

"A reporter from the ""Family Area"" of the New Guobang Cabin Hospital met two pairs of father and son",I came down here,Space,"On the afternoon of April 3, the sun was just right. At the N1 venue of the square cabin hospital of Shanghai New International Expo Center, many people walked outdoors, or with the patients, or sitting in the sun. The ""family district"" in the museum has attracted the attention of many people and sons. The two were facing the computer screen, holding their hands flat, and quickly shaking their legs. Dad's surname was Liu. On the evening of March 30, he received an abnormal call from the nucleic acid testing of the Disease Control Center. The results of the review the next day ""sent"" him and his son to the ward responsible for the medical team of Yueyang Hospital of Xinguo Fang Card Hospital, while the mother was I went to Chongming's square cabin hospital. Mr. Liu told reporters that the night when the nuclearic acid detection was abnormal, he was a little low -fever, took medicine and drink water, and it would be fine one night. The son has jumped from beginning to end. ""I am quite satisfied with the life here."" In the interview, Mr. Liu did not forget the ""chicken baby"" -the listening to the second -year son, ""It was not a school, but I asked."" Mr. Liu has already done it. For a good plan, the daily life of the father and son referred to the alarm clock to get up on time in the morning, and the arrangement was full every day. He went to bed at about 8 pm. The father and son felt that they were eating well in the square -cabin hospital. There were milk, eggs and buns for breakfast, and rice, oil gluten, chicken chop and radish. ""There are also tofu."" The little guy added. Dad said that the mothers who came here and separated through two videos came to the conclusion of ""we are more comfortable here"". ""On the evening of the 2nd, I had a good rest with my children. It was surprising that I had prepared toothpaste, soap, and brushing cups here. These were originally taken by myself."" Sitting on the tie box brought by himself and taking the bed as a small table, the fourth -grade son is playing with iPad. Mr. Fei lives in Pudong New District. During the detection of nucleic acid detection on March 30, it appeared abnormal, and the next day was positive. ""The notice was very anxious yesterday, and we were not enough to pack our luggage."" Mr. Fei said that he pointed to not far away. ""The child's mother also lives in this museum and is within the scope of the naked eye."" Seeing the video of children and parents separated from the treatment of treatment, this was what he was most worried about. Entering the New State Bobe Hospital, this hanging heart finally let go. During the pre -inspection, ""Dabai"" will list the family alone. ""The conditions here are better than I imagined."" The only thing that made Mr. Fei anxious is that it was on Monday, what to do with the child's online class -these two days, he worked on hot spots on traffic. ""Also, I want to drink cold water. But there is only boiling water here, and put it for a while."" The little guy suddenly raised his head and said. Soon, the meal arrived. The nurses pushed the cart to start dinner.

Space,Orange Taste,Space,"Before Yue Yuehui went to Huang Yan, I could actually say that Huang Yan had no concept. But the family heard that I was going to Huangyan and blurted out. Is she going to eat oranges? Speaking of oranges, it must be a simple fruit that countless people have seen from childhood, just like apples, bananas, and pears. The same is true for me. When I was a child, there were many fruit trees in the backyard of the family. At the most prosperous, there were two lame trees, two pomegranate trees, a guava, and a peach tree. There is no orange tree -weird, I didn't seem to have seen orange trees when I was a kid. But oranges are often eaten. At that time, there were two markets near home, and there were two markets near home. One day in five days was ""street sky"" -the parents returned from the market, except to buy back the necessary fresh pork. The main master of pots and pans will buy some snacks by the way. My brother and I heard Ah Dad's bicycle chain appear at the door of the house -to reason that all bicycle chains are almost the same, but at that time, we could suddenly distinguish it -back baskets or pockets on the side of the bicycle back seat or tied pockets with pockets. , Equipped with a lot of goods, we ran up and found things that belonged to us. A orange rolled out, turned over, and found more than one, but a convenient bag. We put the whole bag of oranges, unbutton the bag, and put it under the sun. The sun shines brightly. Each orange has its own bright luster, quiet and vivid, full of beautiful sweetness. After eating oranges, the orange peel was reluctant for a while and a half. What is the use of keeping it? For us, it is not very useful, but we have made a moment of playable items -we like to fold the orange peel, the epidermis is out, squeezing it violently. The sprayed juice has a particularly mixed fragrance irritating smell. If it is on the winter night, eat oranges in the fire pond, and sometimes I can't help baking the orange petals to bake a strange smell; I can't help but be aimed at the light of the fire and squeeze it. The fire jumped, and a little, there was a warm roasting the breath of the fruit. The orange peel is really sent in handy. Grandma gathered the orange peel, spread it out in the dustpan of the bamboo, and put it under the sun. For a few days, the orange peel lost almost all water, curled up and tilted, and the color became dim. I always remember that grandma squatted in the big yard, and the two orange -skinned hands rolled these orange peels. Essence As for whether there is really soaking into a medicinal wine, I can't remember it now, let alone, I naturally have never tasted the taste of the medicinal wine -I can't help but imagine that I will add it in the bitterness and spicy wine of the wine. Is a trace of sweet? Until the last year of life, grandma still cherished the orange peel. When I went home, I took orange many times to her, peeled the oranges and handed it to her. She subconsciously torn off some white silk on the orange petals, and then stuffed the orange petals into her with only two or three teeth. In his mouth, the dry mouth moved like an old cow, squeezing out the juice in the orange petal by the tooth bed. At this time, she still did not forget to tell me to give her orange peel. I handed her the orange peel, and she held the orange peel in her hand. She couldn't hold one hand, so she used two hands, like a baby holding her life. ——Wei Grandma cherishes orange peel? She cherishes the other food and crops. For example, every time I hand it to her with the watermelon, she always wants to exhaust all the red flesh to let go. I was reluctant to appear ""greedy"" almost, and I said how many times the oranges at home, and she didn't listen. Grandma will not know that now these things are not as precious as when I was young. Many times, eating an orange is no longer a rare enjoyment, and it is no longer like a child. Grandma will not know that there are more than ten orange trees on the top of the new house on the third floor of the home. Planting in the frame of wooden boards, short ones, can make a lot of fruits every year. These oranges, unlike those fruits on the backyard tree when we were young, were missing by us all day. These oranges are forgotten, and they can keep them all the time. They have changed from green to orange, from sour and astringent to sweet, staying to the New Year, and when my brother and I go back to pick it. Just this year, neither my brother and I went home. The oranges on the top of the new house must stay longer. In September of the year just after, grandma died. Those things she cherished still stayed in this world of people, destined to stay for a long time. However, they seem to be a bit different. Thinking of a small poem written at the end of 2019, the title is called ""Orange and Peach"" (""Orange"" is the vulgar character of ""Orange"". This poem can only be established with this vulgar word). And copy it here: ""What fruits should I eat in the early winter? What to eat? What kind of landscape / come to the lights, come to us / still, be born from human long -term gaze / as the fruit of still, born in natural long -term breeding / eating an orange, eat a peach / in this early winter, in the early winter, Regardless of ""Ji Zhao"" or not / we grow into a part of nature / the body that bred in darkness / give birth to a bright thought. "" The early winter has passed, and it is spring now. I wonder if the orange trees have blossomed in the Huangyan Mantan Forest? Presumably Huangyan Honey Orange, which has been flowing and fruitful one year a year, will definitely encounter children who have been born and growing year by year, and sneak the ancient and fresh taste into their taste buds, engraved them in their years, and become independent in the future in the future.

A snow, what is the clear and clear life "" -this"" Qingming ""is meaningful. Drinking is the best way to dispatch sentiment. After the Song Dynasty poet Gao Yingqing sacrificed, he lamented: ""There is a drunk in life, and a drop of a drop of Jiuquan."" This poem is the ultimate reason for many people to quit alcohol. Du Mu of the Tang Dynasty, Du Mu looking for wine on the road, chanting the masterpiece of Qingming: ""In the Qingming season, there were many rainy days, and pedestrians on the road wanted to break the soul. By ask the restaurant where there is, the shepherd child refers to Xinghua Village."" In contrast The attitude is the most promising: ""Yesterday, begging for a new fire, the window is divided into and the reading light."" As long as there is an immortal reading light, there is light and hope. Each solar terms are divided into three. Qingming first ""Tong Shihua"". The Congshu began to bloom. In the ancient books, there were Qingtong, Bai Tong, and Zitong. They were all Chinese tungs. They were not common French sycamores on the street. The Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin expressed his junior after the exponentially sang, and he sang: ""Tonghua Wanli Dan Mountain Road, Chuifeng Qing is clear in the old phoenix."" One year and this season, I was open from Weifang to Qingzhou. The boldness and sincerity, so I felt like ""Tonghua Blooming on the Earth of Qilu"". Secondly, the ""field mouse turned into"", and (rú) is a bird like quail. The predecessors explained that at this time, the yang was rising, and there were less negative field mice, and there were more positive quails. This was the time of all things. Three -waiting ""Rainbow See"", ""Two water clamping mirrors, double bridges falling rainbow."" Rainbow has always been the most mysterious landscape. The ancients believed that the rainbow was the product of yin and yang meeting. Using ""yin and yang"" to explain the world is the worldview and methodology formed by the ancient Chinese in that scientific stage. Qingming solar terms, three flowers believers, the first is Tonghua. The second is wheat flowers. The wheat flowers are small and white are the hope of the farming nation. The third is the willow flower, which is catkins. The inconspicuous Liuhua has always been the favorite of the poet.

Recalling that when I was carrying a vegetable gift package last night, I was ""no self"". Sometimes you don't need others to know you, and you just do it, just do it. Just like launching dragons in the WeChat group, making forms, presidents of Hui, answering doubts, sharing the remaining grains, providing translation, organizational operations, etc., so much information every day, in the second time the updated dragon, who is in the process of this process, who is in this process.

But, I believe Many changes have taken place, whether it is itself, or about this familiar building, community, or this city. We will feel that the neighborhood is concerned, shorter parents, and mutual assistance is also a necessity of life. We will miss the thousands of information in the group every day (I hope that this situation will not happen again), but there may be an extra corridor or elevator in the elevator.

Space,It turns out that it can be taken like this,Space,"Talking about the photography collection of Dongxin and Shiwu, there is a sense of liberation: It turns out that the flowers can still take this way! Because I usually only take the flowers I planted without the flowers I bought, the strange flowers in his album also reminded me from time to time, and so many strange flowers are waiting for me to challenge their cultivation I go to explore their peculiar beauty. I realize that all stages of the flowers are beautiful and can be taken; the physiological organs of the plants are beautiful and can be taken. (1) The first volume of Dongxin's ""Plant Book"" was sent by a writer friend. The first impression that this photography album gives me can be described as ""shock"". The strange light (in the first volume of Dongxin and vertebrae use artificial light, that is, the light of the flash), the collection of those strange plants obliquely, not only the color of the plants, but also their texture of their texture. It appears, and each petal and every leaf are so clear. The light and shadow are intertwined, and the bright and dark changes, the bright colors and the heavy darkness are tied. The first volume was released in 2021, including Dongxin's flower art works from 2009-2012. Now ""Plants"" has been out of the fourth volume, and I bought each one. Its Chinese name is a bit dry (in Japanese is the four Chinese characters of ""Plant Book""), and the English version of the name is EncyClopaedia of Flowers. The name of the plant reference book, but in fact it is a set of artistic photography of the most dramatic flower and plant. A set of photographic sets of such a name can be out of the fourth volume, which itself shows its success. I also bought ""Floris Magnificat"", which is a collection of flower art photography from a British publishing house to Dongxin. (2) Dongxin's full name is Dongxin Kangren. He was born in Fukuoka, Japan in 1976. In middle school, he was keen on punk rock music. He also organized a rock band with his classmates and friends. His later partner, Shi Junuke, was his classmate at the time and a member of the band. After graduating from middle school, he took his band to Tokyo to develop, but he couldn't make ends meet, so he went to a flower shop next to a supermarket to work. It was there, and he found his special sensitivity to flowers and special talents for floral art. Dongxin went to Tokyo's flower wholesale market -OTA Market. This is the largest flower wholesale market in Japan and the world's second largest flower wholesale market. There are strange flowers and various flower art materials from all over the world and various climate bands, which can provide rich materials for his creations. In 2002, he opened a high -level custom flower shop in Ginza and Shi Mujie. But his thoughts were too ahead, and there were few customers from the beginning. At the beginning, the rent of Dongxinlian apartment could not afford it, and could only live in the wife's house. After that, he produced some ingenious floral installation works and behavior art works, such as his ""bottle flower"" and ""plant sculpture"" series, which started to reputation, and his career slowly stepped on track. This small text mainly talks about his flower art photography with vertebrae, and his installation works and behavior art works will not be talked about. After the career, Dongxin and Zetu started a division of labor: Dongxin was mainly responsible for making floral works, while vertebrae took them down after the work was completed. After these photos are accumulated, we have the photography books we have seen. (3) Watching the photos of those flower art works of Dongxin can feel the sensitivity of his beauty of plants. Not only are flowers, but also the colors, shapes, patterns, and textures of buds, fruits, buds, root systems, and even dead branches, and special sensitivity to the various hints they bring. An important part of artistic talents can even be said to be the foundation, isn't it sensitive? Of course, on this basis, there must be the will of expression and execution. I have seen a lot of flowers and plant photography of another Japanese photographer Araki Araki. Of course, from the perspective of photography, the subject matter and scope of Araki are much wider than Dongxin and vertebrae. But Araki is a professional photographer, not a professional floral expert. Compared with Araki's flowers and plant photography works, we can see that the latter knows the flower. The flowers shot by Araki are more commonly available flowers, but he has extremely rich creativity, supplemented his lack of understanding of the flower material. Dongxin will use special flowers and make them special combinations. He will use the general flower arrangement people to use things inside the bouquet, such as the pierced fairy ball, the furry buds of the furry, the gray -white leaves of the air pineapple, the tropical orchids with strange spots on the petals, shining shining Metal spots of tropical begonia leaves, emperor flowers native to South Africa, silver birch flowers native to Australia, fairy Lan (also known as Dragon) with swelling tongue petals, and the white exposed roots are blooming with flowers The roots of the ball, the rigidly cracked Bagura buds, and even the bergamot, pine cones, the cracked blood pomegranate, etc., and sometimes there are bonsai pine trees. All of them are hand -in -hand. In addition to the photos of the black background, Dongxin and Shichen sometimes take white backgrounds. The photos of the black background are often a flat combination of a variety of flowers (many flower art works in Dongxin are placed in a box or box, and many flowers are tightly squeezed together). The unique combination of two or three flowers, such as a dragon -youmei's tune branches, with two dark purple -red peony; a yellow -green elegant narcissus, with a hammering bud. The flower photography of Dongxin and Araki was greatly inspired by my photography. For Dongxin, all stages of flowers can be beautiful. In his works, there are flowers, blooming flowers, and withering flowers. There are beauty and ugliness; there are positive and evil; there are water tenderness and dryness; there are slippery, rough and more thorn; there are newborn, there are also deaths; there are gorgeous and even glamorous, pure white and pure black; good ones are good; there are good ones; Symbol, there are also evil hints. One characteristic of Japan is that on the one hand, various traditional arts are well preserved, but on the other hand, there are active innovations. Dongxin has greatly expanded the scope of Japanese flower roads or flower arrangement art. In this sense, Dongxin, who did not become a punk player, became a pioneer in the flower Daojie.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-09/7.htm,4/9/22,,,True
Space,Lai Family,Space,"Luo Yuming has many slaves in Jiafu. The slaves also have a level, and they are also divided into ""face"" and ""faceless"". The highest level is the two brothers of the Lai family. The boss is the head of Rongguo Mansion, and the second child is the head of Ning Guofu. As for the most faces, they have to count their mother Lai Yan. In the fourth thirteenth time, when the old lady Jia Jun was confession, Lai Yan could sit on a small bench, but Wang Xifeng could only stand. The book ""Dream of Red Mansions"" explains the principle of ""sitting"" and ""standing"" because of ""Jiafu customs, and the family members who have served their parents in the year are more decent than the young master."" That is to say, Lai Yan has served the master who has been long -lasting than Wang Xifeng. This should be Jia Yan or Jia Zheng. Lai Yan pointed at Jia Baoyu again, saying that the master (Jia Zheng) and the grandfather (Jia Xun) were so painful when she was a child, and she looked at it with her eyes. It can be seen that when she is old, she has a generation than Jia Yan. She is a grandmother -grade figure with Jia mother. Although the Lai family is a slave, she is quite rich. Jia's mother said faced Lai Yan as a ""rich man"". To what extent is rich? For example, it can be seen that the fifty -sixth round of Tanchun is written, and Hepero talked about the garden of everyone, ""There is no one (referring to the Grand View Garden)."" Is it small, right? But reading cannot be neglected. You think, the Grand View Garden said by Jia Yi, the Zhou Chang is three and a half miles (for nearly two kilometers based on the settlement). ""Less than half"", counting it is one -third, 120 acres of gardens, just in Beijing, that is also a rich scene! Rich and rich, wealth is expensive. The identity of this family also transformed. They were originally ""family members"", and they were slaves to the generations of Jiafu. However, due to the credit of the master, Lai Da's son Lai Shangrong was born, and the Jia family asked him to take off the identity of slaves and have a freedom. Lai Yan said that he was also a brocade, maid, servant, nanny, and hesitated since he was a child; and he also went to school with his son -in -law. This is not a slave lifestyle at all. At the age of 20, with the power of Jiafu, the Lai family spent money to buy Lai Shangrong's official title for Zhixian County. Donor, in the wealthy family, seeking identity and decentness, and mixing on the scene, for example, Jia Yue donated a little knowledge; for the Lai family, he demanded a more affordable. Therefore, it is also relied on the care of Jiafu. When Lai Shangrong was 30 years old, he changed from a false title to a real duty and became a real parent official. Sister Feng said well, ""In the old lady's courtyard, I saw that he was wearing the new official's clothes again, and he was more mighty, and he was fatter than before."" Only then. Since the Lai family is a slave to Jiafu, the accumulation of wealth is of course inseparable from Jiafu. This is like the parasites we see in the forest, the big trees are thick, the rattan and the branches and leaves are also strong, and they are full of vitality. However, this parasitic details are rarely revealed in the book, and readers can only make approximately speculation. For example, when the Grand View Garden was built, except for Jia Zheng and Jia Yi, the specific manager was the two brothers of the Lai family. Jia Zheng is stubborn and stubborn, not in the world, Jia Yi is light and smooth, the city's government is shallow, and the brothers of the Lai family are silent, but there is a lot of space. The Grand View Garden is huge, and there are many opportunities for profit. You see that Jia Yun got a difference between a monitoring tree. The leaders were two hundred and two, and only fifty -two silver to buy trees. But if it is said that the Lai family's wealth is all from the corruption of Jiafu, I am afraid that they are wrong; in fact, it is not so easy. Where is more opportunities? Jiafu has power, and there are many people who ask them. In the sixtieth time, a Guangdong official visited Rongguo, and contributed two baskets of Poria cream, and also gave it to the ""door"" basket. This is the ""benefit fee"" we are now talking about. Brother Lai is the general manager. They handle many things that Jiafu negotiate with the outside world. This is not directly from Jiafu, and there is no obvious reason to blame them. Among the slaves in Jiafu, the Lai family is undoubtedly the best development. Why do they? Qualifications? There are more qualifications, but it does not work. Just say Jiao Da, ""Following the tattoo (that is, Ning and Rong, the two national public) from the children, and the soldiers have been sold for three or four soldiers."" This qualification is no longer comparable in Jiafu; and, he ""from the dead. ""Back in the pile"" carried Taiye out "", it was very contributed. Therefore, he was very high, and looked down on the big manager, claiming to be: ""Jiao Dafa's feet are taller than your head! Who is Jiao Dafa's eyes in the eyes of 20 years?"" What about then? The second child of Lai Jia, who was qualified to do, went to work hard; if he was dissatisfied, he was nonsense and violated the master, and he could only stuff a mouthful of horses and throw it in the horse. The key to the Lai family is in a word that Lai Yan said, that is, ""know how the word"" slave ""is written!"" Divided, the benefits of bit by bit, say only ""the grace of the master"", never talk about your work, and not to say how much money you spend. This can get the favor of the Lord, and in the end, he won the transformation of the descendants. Jiao Da always remember his own credit. The word ""slave talent"" was not well written, so slaves were died. There is a subtle feature that is very interesting: Rong Guofu also has a two -headed manager Lin Zhixiao. You can often see his cleverness in the story of ""Dream of Red Mansions"", but you can't read the cleverness of Lai Da. Because of the cleverness of that Lin Zhixiao, it can only be the second manager. There is also a more interesting question. I have never seen it: Lai's people, did they originally surnamed Lai? Where does this question come from? It was ""Dream of Red Mansions"" mentioned that when the head of Ning Guofu and the second child of the Lai family, he called him ""Lai Sheng"" instead of ""Lai Sheng"". This name appears more than ten times, and it is impossible to make mistakes. Those who have read some old novels are easy to understand: this ""come"" is by no means surname. Adding auspicious eyes behind the word ""Lai"" is a commonly used title of the ancient owner to the male servant. Wang Xifeng has a servant called Lai Wang; in ""Jin Ping Mei"", the servants of Ximen Qing have Lai Wang, Lai Bao, Laijue, Laixing, and so on. This is the name of the master with the name of the servant to please himself. To put it cold, the name of the dogs in the past is also common. So, do the servants have their own surnames? Or, did they retain their original surnames when they were called ""Lai""? This is not important. The little life is insignificant in the world, and there is no need to pursue the origin of the bloodline. A Q said that he was surnamed with Master Zhao, no one believed him: ""Oh! You are also with the surname Zhao!"" Back to ""Dream of Red Mansions"", it seemed to have left a flaw here. It was called ""Lai"". Later, the head manager needed to deal with the outside world in a decent name to use the homophonic ""Lai"" as the last name. This is meaningful. But in any case, Lai Yan's grandson and Zhixian County Lai Shangrong must be Lai. When he goes to be an official, there will be words and names, what is called ""mountain people"" and the like. If he invites someone to write a line, he will also investigate the origin of Lai: The descendants of Emperor Yan are divided into four, one is Lie Shan's, and the ancient sounds and Li Tong, so it depends on the family.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-09/8.htm,4/9/22,8th Edition: Nightlight Cup,,True

Space,A home book,Space,"In the spring of Hu Yuan in 2022, the epidemic invaded my hometown -Shanghai. On March 1, 2022, one of the new local COVID-19 confirmed cases in Shanghai. From then on, seeing you, it seems to have become so difficult. On March 14, 2022, her daughter was ill and had a high fever of 39 ° C. Coincidentally, I didn't dare to neglect. I hurried to Xinhua Hospital with a big bag with her bag. 16:13 began to queue. I did not expect that the nucleic acid was completed by more than 21 points. Only after the nucleic acid results were released, the medicine could be distributed. After a few hours of line up, the sun and the moon were seen. The child lying in my arms was a bit cold in the tall fever. I was a little cold. I didn't hesitate to take off the down jacket on my body, and then hugged her, so I was not so cold. Looking at the patients around, they were either couple, or a family. They bought them alone, queued alone, and sat on the side of the road with a high fever with a high fever. But me, only one person, with a sick child, I have complained for the first time, complaining that you who are not home have not seen you for a few days. On March 16, 2022, 5+197, Shanghai, Yangpu District held the first 48 -hour nucleic acid detection of Jianglu Street.

On March 18, 2022, near the weekend, WeChat repeated the story of yesterday again: Wife, I will not come back tomorrow, too many units are closed in the community. we agreed. It seems that the plate chickens this week have fallen. On March 23, 2022, my daughter learned to ride a bicycle for the first time. The sentence was still: When my father came back on the weekend, I could perform him! In the evening, WeChat sounded again: my wife, send me a single and change clothes, more and more people are isolated in the community, I really ... this time, I didn’t bear it again, and I lost a paragraph: Everyone is alone. The decorative pool is the same as the same role as the actor in the TV series, but it will always be divided into the protagonist and supporting role. But you are always greedy than the people in the play, and you always hope to play all your roles well, regardless of the master! You are a father and a husband, but you always think that there is me at home, everything is done, it is OK, you can put all time and energy on work. Why can others be blocked at home in the community, why you are afraid of being blocked at home, and you dare not go home for half a month. My daughter and I are in your eyes, what exactly is. For a long time, I just waited: Sorry, you worked hard, sorry. That night, I was crying in the bed, and I had never felt a sense of weakness to climb my whole body. At 10:20 on March 27, 2022, I finally waited for you to go home with a few bags of vegetables. I am happy like a child. My daughter pulls you for a minute and does not want to delay your performance to learn to ride a bicycle. You roll up your sleeves, get into the kitchen, and promise a long plate of chickens. You said you can eat it at noon today. I stood behind you and looked at it carefully. You were thin and lost a lot. At least there were more than a dozen pounds. The knee of the knife was moved at the end of last year. 12:00, the chicken hasn't been in the pot yet, so I heard that our community is going to be sealed again. I know what you are thinking, and hurry up to help you pack clean clothes, pack other dishes and rice just fried. Launched you: Hurry up, hurry up, otherwise there is really no one at the scene. You holding a bag, wearing a mask, standing at the door, hugging me and my daughter hard, I didn't hold back, I cried, and you blushed, and your daughter tangled you and refused to put it. I opened her hard. Hands, wave your hand to you. That's it, it's gone again. Daughter: ""Dad, dad, I'm waiting for you home! I'm waiting for you!"" The crying of the crying continued from the door to the window. On March 29, 2022, you told me: Wife, I want to build a house to help Shanghai resist the disease, and I will be very busy in the next few days. You don’t have to worry about me, tell Coco: Dad will help more people, come back, come back, and come back. The big plate of chickens made for her is more fragrant! From March 30, 2022 to April 5, 2022, my daughter and I will leave you on WeChat every day. By two or three in the morning, you will reply to us one by one before going to bed, telling us to pay attention to safety. At that time, you told me that you were a little tired.

Space,"Weather, warms",Space,"Chu Bannong's global warming has a long time. This report can also be found on the Internet, saying that since 1981 to 1990, the average temperature throughout the earth has increased by 0.48 ° C. From my personal observation and experience perspective, the feeling of warming and rising temperatures is very obvious, and the rise seems to be a higher glance. No, this year is still in the ""Dragon's head"", the highest temperature actually ran towards ""three (30 ° C)"". At the end of March last year, Zun, a friend who lived in a small villa, sent a lot of photos on WeChat, which was the peony flower in his home. I was surprised that the peony that should be blossoming in April, and now the Luyan date is almost a month in advance! Later, there was a photo of the peony flower taken from the park. In fact, this scene that peony blooms early is not only available this year, nor is it not only peony, but many other flowers also bloom in advance. The flowering of peony requires a certain temperature support, and it takes a period of time to accumulate the temperature. Now it has bloomed early, and it is actually as much as a month. This can only indicate that the temperature in the same period is indeed much higher. There has always been such a saying in rural Shanghai: Gu Yu looked at peony in the three dynasties. Gu Yu's solar terms are behind Qingming, and the festival is on April 19-21. That is to say, the peony flowering date should be until late April. When I was in the old house, my small court had a peony in my heart. It was planted by my father in the late 1940s. It was purple -red, single petals, and after flowering, it was like a large bowl, hanging above the branches. At that time, peony was still rare, so every year, the folks on the house would come to see the peony, and even the famous doctor Zhang Yikang on Qibao Old Street also came. In fact, there are peony flowers in his family, but the variety is different. He worked at Xinzhuang Commune Health Center and was the doctor responsible for contacting our brigade. Time, of course after the rain. In the 1970s, the ""three familiar systems"" of food planting in rural areas have vigorously promoted the planting of ""three cooked systems"", that is, in the past year, ""wheat -rice"" was planted in the middle of the cooked cooked in the middle of the past, becoming ""wheat -rice -rice"". Early rice planting time should be advanced. Although the amount of planting will not be a lot, each production team will be arranged for a few acres and as many as one or twenty acres. At the end of April, early May is the early stubble early rice seedlings. How much is the temperature at that time? It is about 5 ° C. Generally, the weather is very cold, because everyone is still wearing old cloth jackets (cotton clothes, there is no down sweater at that time). Planting seedlings is the life of women, but the fields are naked. The water in the field is too cold. Essence The contradiction between seedling and coldness is highlighted and placed in front of the production captain. What do you do, what should I do? I do n’t know which production team thinks of the first way, or everyone thinks about it: let the young members of the group complete this task. Open up and get used to it. Anyway, it will resolve contradictions every year in the future. Later, there were farmland boots that could grow seedlings. Naturally, women could go to the field of seedling seedlings (earned). Of course, the young people of the group also had farmland boots, and the contradictions were completely resolved. Besides winter. When I was a kid, when I walked to the old house, I always ran to the beach to knock on the ice. When the sky is colder, the ice surface is larger and thicker. The male classmates will try it, and they can only use the toes. When you are lucky, you can take one or two steps on the ice. It won't work before, after all, the ice here is just thin ice. Now, Bo Bing is gone, and even the frost is rare. In the past, there was a word called ""Bai Nongshou"" or ""Lao Bai Nongshou"", which refers to the kind of frost with a thickness, thick crystals, and can be divided into corners. This kind of frost appeared overnight, and it would be too cold to shive. The adult said that the outside of Lela (in) the white thick frost. When I went out the next morning, it was probably the kind of frost written by Mr. Wang Guowei, ""Full Cream is full of snow"". And now? Either there is no frost for a long time, that is, there is frost, it is thin, light, faint, not formed, no corners, which is far from the ""old white thick frost"". The reason is simple: the temperature is higher than before. As for the summer, there was always a saying of ""35 ° C or above). What now? A high temperature of 35 degrees Celsius can last for ten or twenty days, and the absolute temperature of 378 degrees Celsius or even higher feet can also appear continuously. Just after half a century, the temperature changes so much, and the weather is getting hotter. What should I do? I know, I don't know, this is the thinking that environmental retains.

Sun Chunlan came to the municipal big data center to learn more about the time consumption and timely partition statistics of the nucleic acid testing, and required further strengthening the efficient connection and collaborative linkage of ""picking, sending, inspecting, reporting, transferring, and receiving"". Limit compression time, improve efficiency, fast out of results, timely discover risks personnel and quickly transfer to interfers. Subsequently, Sun Chunlan went to Fudan University and Tongji University to learn more about the implementation of prevention and control measures, emergency response disposal of epidemics, teaching activities, and teacher -student living security. Vulnerability, we really care about the majority of teachers and students in thought, teaching and life, and fully guard the safety of teachers and students and the safety of campus. Sun Chunlan pointed out that as a large city with a population of 25 million, the current Shanghai epidemic prevention and control is in the most important stage. It is necessary to further unify the thinking, so as to be fast and expensive. The construction of the cabin hospital and isolation point has quickly advanced. It is necessary to analyze the trend of the epidemic in a timely manner, and provide a strong support for optimizing the prevention and control measures of the epidemic. According to the results of the whole round of nucleic acid testing, it is necessary to dynamically adjust the ""three districts"" settings of the seal control zone, control zone, and prevention zone to minimize the impact of the epidemic on production and life. It is necessary to do a good job of medical treatment, adhere to the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine, categorize treatment, and continue to improve the level of treatment in accordance with the principles of homogeneity and standardization, protect every life, and accumulate the experience of treatment. While quickly organizing the work of entering the hospital quickly and orderly, we must do a good job of discharged from the hospital for rehabilitation, establish a connection mechanism from hospitals, squares to communities to ensure that the people from discharged departures go home smoothly. Party committees and governments at all levels should carry forward the spirit of continuous combat, and to implement the deployment tasks in place, so as to achieve a stronger determination. It is necessary to continue to enrich the grass -roots prevention and control force, carefully do the work of the masses, actively help solve problems, and better unite the masses to lead the masses to win the prevention and control of the epidemic prevention and control.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-11/2.htm,4/11/22,第2版:要闻,,True
Space ,"If you do n’t shake it, you will be able to defeat the epidemic ","—— Liang Wannian, the leader of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission COVID-19 epidemic, ","Yesterday afternoon, the head of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission's COVID-19 epidemic response work leading group, the executive deputy dean and professor of the School of Public Health and Health of Tsinghua University, Liang Wannian in Shanghai at the current stage of Shanghai's epidemic prevention and resistance. Zero ""target realization, challenges facing Shanghai, and other parties are concerned about collective interviews with the media. Liang Wannian said that now we have effectively curbed the rapid rise of the infected person's index, but we must also deeply realize that the number of infected people in Shanghai's daily reports is still high, and the epidemic situation is still severe and complicated. We must not take it lightly. Essence Concentrated isolation is the necessary Liang Wannian to say that adherence to asymptomatic infections and mild patients with centralized isolation. This is determined by my country's general strategy of ""external prevention input and internal prevention."" Promoting the ""dynamic clearing zero"" is to find out all the infected people in the community, and then implement centralized isolation management and give corresponding treatment. In this regard, it is clear: First, Omikon's strain spreads quickly. If the asymptomatic infected and mild patients are isolated at home, it may cause renewal infections to the family, which will lead to extensive spread and ""dynamic clearing"" time. Extending, the goal of zero society cannot be achieved in a short time. Second, from the perspective of global epidemic situations, scientific research shows that asymptomatic infections and mild patients are also contagious. Third, at home isolation requires conditions, to ensure that the family has corresponding isolation conditions, while monitoring the development of the infected person's disease. If the elderly and other fragile persons such as their homes areolate, they may not be able to monitor and discover them in a timely manner, nor can they be treated in a timely manner. Liang Wannian emphasized that Omikon's strains are mainly spread through the respiratory tract, but many domestic and foreign studies have shown that they can also spread through direct contact. If the asymptomatic infected person and mild patients are isolated in the family, there are always risks of communication risks in the sewer, ventilation system and other facilities. Of course, some special groups such as infants and young children, the elderly, and the disabled can indeed be unable to achieve centralized isolation. In this regard, professional institutions and professionals must be judged to ensure that their home isolation has corresponding protective conditions and can achieve continuous condition tracking management. Essence Concentrated isolation is to ensure the health of the people and the safety of life. It is still necessary in the current situation. Liang Wannian said that unblocking has conditions and standards that the number of infections that Shanghai have reported for many days in a row for many days. The main reasons include: First, the city of Shanghai conducts antigen detection and nucleic acid detection. Through active response, the infected person who has not been found before was found. Second, there is a wide range of community transmission in the Shanghai epidemic. It must be discovered by active screening. Without this step, the number of infected people will increase. The number reported every day shows that the static management and screening of the whole area play a role, and it also shows that the Shanghai epidemic is now on a high -level platform area. At present, Shanghai is in the stage of ""surrounding and drying"" the epidemic. Liang Wannian said that Shanghai is currently implemented in static management. The concept of unblocking is to relieve static management in the whole region. The unblocking includes multiple levels, some are unblocking of urban surfaces, and some are unblocking in communities and streets. The unblocking conditions and situations at different levels are different. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have studied unblocking in accordance with relevant national prevention and control standards and specifications. When the community was unlocked one by one, the city surface was unblocked. Liang Wannian emphasized that unblocking has conditions and standards. To ensure that the transmission chain is cut off and no continuous dissemination, the newly discovered infected people are in the field of vision, rather than actively seeking or vision. I believe that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, under the unified command and deployment of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, through the active efforts of various industries and front lines, especially the extensive participation of ordinary people in Shanghai, the time will come soon. Liang Wannian believes that from the perspective of epidemic prevention and control, the key to solving the problems of blocking points, difficulties, and key points is to do the following aspects. First, quickly screen the source of the infection, that is, the infected person, and quickly transfer to the designated hospital for treatment. Second, find out close contact with the close contact with the accurate epidemiological survey, and quickly transfer to the corresponding isolation point. Third, firm confidence, adhere to the overall strategy of ""external prevention input, internal prevention and rebound"", and the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"". The territory, departments, units, and individuals form a joint force to resist. Anti -epidemic is a systematic engineering risk and challenge that may occur in Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control in the future. Liang Wannian said that anti -epidemic is a systematic project and major project, which firmly moves to the goal of ""dynamic clearing zero"". First, in order to truly realize the ""bed and other people"", the infected people who are diagnosed and screened, whether they are squares or designated hospitals, must have enough beds to treat them to prevent ""people waiting for beds"". In the same way, those who have a comprehensive and accurate identification of close contact and close contact with the secondary contact cannot be missed. After identifying, the ""bed and others"" of the isolation point will be achieved. Secondly, the spread of Shanghai is mainly in the family, but there are many large enterprises and factories in Shanghai in Shanghai. These enterprises are required to ensure the normal operation of the city and the economic and social operation. Implementation of various prevention and control measures. Similarly, institutions such as schools, nursing homes, children's welfare homes, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions are defended as the top priority. It is necessary to strictly guard against death. We must effectively formulate various plans, and to truly implement various prevention and control measures and implement closed -loop management. Third, we must pay special attention to the prevention and control of the elderly, children, and people with basic diseases. The proportion of people over 60 years old in Shanghai is relatively high, and the absolute number is also large. In this regard, whether it is the government, the relevant departments, or the people, we must deeply recognize the urgency and formulate various methods, such as further strengthening vaccine vaccination, especially improvement The vaccine vaccination rate for the whole process, prevent infection, reduce the rate of severe illness and mortality. Effective vaccination can have more than 90%of efficiency to prevent severe illnesses and death. Fourth, people who pay attention to ensuring the normal operation of Shanghai cities, such as water and electricity maintenance guarantee personnel, courier brother, transportation industry personnel, public security police officers, medical staff, etc. It is fine, reinforcement, and reinforcement, implementing responsibilities to ensure that these people are not infected. Ensuring the medical and health needs of 25 million people are always key tasks. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have taken a series of effective measures to ensure the normal medical and health needs of the people. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that children's immune planning, maternal and child health care, etc. should be implemented in accordance with procedures and requirements. In the end, Shanghai also faces the challenge of foreign defense input. As an international metropolis, many overseas flights come in every day. The work of foreign prevention input cannot be relaxed. Always adhere to the character of the characters. Liang Wannian said that Shanghai is capable of dealing with these challenges. From the perspective of experts, the people of Shanghai have always felt the high spirit of altruisticism. The quality of the Shanghai people, the understanding of prevention and control measures, and a high sense of responsibility have made people fully appreciate. Shanghai's medical and health systems and other departments, the professional level and dedication of professionalism, are also worthy of learning and praise. Shanghai's urban management capabilities, both at the urban level and at the community governance level, have good foundations and conditions. Our common enemy is a virus. We are compared with the disease of COVID-19. As long as everyone is highly unified, it will be unified to the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"".

Space,The people have confidence and strength for this matter,Space,"Pan Fengfeng tells a story that happened in our community. Yesterday evening, several volunteers were distributing foods purchased by residents. An old man embarrassed to ask him if he could be partial, because he would not buy food online, and he would not buy it. It's right. A volunteer listened, and immediately gave the old uncle the two boxes he just bought. This story is warm and sad. As the sealing control continues, these days, most of the dishes that everyone stored in the early days have been exhausted, and there are not many dishes. In addition to the lack of main non -non -staple foods, daily necessities, epidemic prevention materials, and basic medicines have also been in a hurry. The guarantee of the living materials of 25 million citizens has become the topic that everyone cares about. Especially when the light people were busy grabbing vegetables on their mobile phones and picking up dragon group buying, those elderly people who were not able to use their mobile phones were inevitable. The Shanghai epidemic is still running at a high level. In the big battle of this epidemic prevention and control, preservation of supply is not only a matter of people's livelihood, but also the core issue of resistance, because it is about confidence and the hearts of the people. In order to defeat the virus, citizens are willing to temporarily sacrifice freedom and be bored at home, but if the basic life is not guaranteed, confidence will shake, and persistence will be unsustainable. The Chinese say that the people use food as the sky. They have food in their hands and do not panic in their hearts. Confidence, self -discipline, and order are based on sufficient supplies. At present, the storage and reserves of Shanghai rice noodles, oil and meat, etc. are sufficient, and assisting supplies in various places have continued to reach. However, due to the unable to operate normally, most of the business super and vegetable farms still exist in ""difficult to buy food"" and ""difficulty in distribution"". The distribution gap of ""last mile"" and ""last 100 meters"" is very prominent. How to send sufficient living materials to millions of households? This is a must -answer question, and it is a question. At the press conference these days, the vice president of Meituan Mao Fang, Wang Wenbo, Vice President of JD.com, and Xiao Shuixian, senior vice president of Hungry, and other e -commerce leaders appeared, bringing a lot of good news. For example, Meituan has opened community sets, group meals, emergency helpers and other services; JD.com's first batch of key guarantee materials have arrived in Shanghai through JD logistics special car, including over 80,000 maternal and infant materials; Return to the post and strive to solve the bottleneck of ""last mile"", ""last 100 meters"" distribution, and so on. Shanghai has also established a list of white -supply -guaranteed white lists, and gradually unsealed the wholesale market, distribution center, e -commerce warehouse, and central kitchen that strictly implemented epidemic prevention and control measures. All districts have also announced their respective supply channels. At the same time, the courier brothers such as non -immune -related causes are allowed to be closed in the community. In this background, these days, community group purchase is becoming more and more active. ""My community, my group"" has become a hot word on the Internet. All kinds of food buying groups and group buying groups not only shorten neighborhood relationships, nourish the humanity of the city, but also enhance residents' autonomy. In the very time, the capacity is limited, and the community group purchase is indeed useful, but Shanghai still needs to build a more stable, more expected, and more inclusive supply network as soon as possible to truly stabilize people's hearts. After all, Shanghai has entered an aging society. For the elderly, online dragon group purchase may be ""another element"". They will not, and they can't learn. Even the ""head"" who are active online and offline are facing many uncertainty every day. The goods are gone, and the residents have returned orders. All kinds of accidents make people feel heartbroken. It is really difficult to ""feed"" 25 million people under the premise of epidemic prevention safety. But no matter how difficult it is, we must solve the difficulties for the people and worry about the party. Must be soberly realized that the confession is to protect victory! Government departments at all levels are incomparable. We must find ways to open up the blocking points, crack the problems, and do everything possible to complete it. Because this is what the masses are most concerned about and expect, the root of faith, the starting point of hope. Only by winning this battle can we inject more confidence and strength into the long -lasting battle of the epidemic prevention and control.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-11/4.htm,4/11/22,4th Edition: Shanghai News,,True

Only the lights in the houses on both sides show the anger that the city can touch. An hour later, the bus was entered the Shilong Road square cabin hospital. Since the end of March, I have not been in the gate of the community. The habit of walking in the community every night has also been canceled. As the epidemic is getting worse, there are more and more epidemic prevention tasks that have been implemented to the community. Seeing that there are not enough people in the community, I also sign up to join the service team. In the face of the disaster, the public is a city, and one more person will have more strength. I serve the front line of the anti -epidemic as many young guys and girls: I am the supplies for residents to live, and when I encounter a sealing family, I will carry it on the 6th floor; According to the call, the residents of the building are organized in an orderly manner; the antigen reagent is distributed, the statistical results are reported, and the culverts are obtained for the residents ... All this makes me feel the happiness of serving others. On April 5th, a mixed pipe test was performed, and my pipe was Yang. The next day, the antigen detection, I became the ""captain of the middle."" Later, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention came to do a single -tube test to be diagnosed. Why! I was unfortunately recruited, but fortunately, my wife who lived in a room with me was not infected. This square hospital was originally a factory area, and the large area can accommodate nearly a thousand people. Patients from all over Xuhui District came over by bus, men, women and children. The lever box and backpack are standard, bustling. The two children laughed on the open space and made trouble, which was really ""the teenager didn't know the sorrow"". A large number of crowds were poured into a large number of people at once, registering code scanning, and time -consuming time to check in. Later, the manager asked everyone to move in first, so that some elderly people avoided being affected. There are new iron shelves in the square cabin, and the pillows and bedding are also new, and the ground has been poisoned. There are enough toilets and toilets. Bathing in hot water 24 hours, people who have come early have taken a shower. The square cabin is divided into several areas. Unlike the previous hospitals, it is divided into the ward with numbers, but is named after flowers, such as mountain tea, magnolia, etc. I am in the peony area. Compared with those cold Arabic numerals, flowers make people feel warm and hopeful. Serve medical staff from Shandong from Shandong. The ""big white"" listened patiently about the patient's questions and answered them carefully without impatient. The problems that can be solved are solved on the spot. Although I can't see the face behind the mask, I believe it must be a respectable angel -like face. I heard many people around them praised Dr. Shandong! When I learned that I was infected with COVID-19, some people asked me: ""Are you scared?"" Although my answer is not so powerful, but from the inner true confession: ""Don't be afraid."" After writing this short article, it is already a night and night. Time. The square cabin is brightly lit, and some people enter the dream hometown. I hope that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, and the new day will bring us new good news. Dai Cunliang",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-11/5.htm,4/11/22,5th edition: Shanghai News,,True

I am his cousin, from Syria, called Monav."" Monav is a realist volunteer. No one goes to go. Mobilize him. At that time, a building adjacent to a building was closed because of the closure of the epidemic. The neighborhood committee was on the bottom floor of the Monav's own building. He saw that the people inside were nervous and busy. The people inside were so busy that they saw strangers without saying a lot, and pushed him out. ""I live in the community and is a foreigner studying medicine. Signing up as a volunteer, I want to pay for it!""

His slow and low voice was more exciting. From morning to night, Monov followed the cadres of the neighborhood committee. Where he needed him, where he appeared, he didn't see him for a while.

Under the epidemic, people wear masks, and everyone's face is freehand. The mask seems to be leaving white in the painting. Instead, you think that the person is more imaginative. Monav just gave me this impression. Monov told me that he was from Syrian Damascus and came to study in China in 2007. In 2010, he became a volunteer of the Shanghai World Expo. He has been a volunteer for more than ten years on various occasions. Monov's father is a writer who loves and studies Chinese culture. Monov gave me a ""China and Silk Road"" written by his father. When he talked about his father's advice that his father gave him when he came to China: China is a country that is good at the world. You must learn Chinese culture and be a good person. Essence According to his research, good people are divided into three in China. People are good at good, choosing good but solidity is a gentleman. Monov, if you want to be a good person, you must do a lot of kindness, at least you can become an ordinary person. My father hopes that you will be a gentleman in China. Monav couldn't forget the entrustment of his father's focus, heavier academic, enthusiastic about public welfare activities, helping others, and paying attention to learning to be good. Once, I drank and chat with friends in the Fuxing Park Bar, and she had a snoring person, and a person shook in front of him. The man smiled at them and kissed them. Monov felt abnormal. He loves football, and the sports make him natural clever. When he turned around, he suddenly found that someone behind him walked away with a bag of leather in the chair. Monov flew up and chased it towards the thief. Holding the thief's body, the other hand hit 110 alarms. The police eventually caught the thief, and Monav helped to find the friend who had already left the scene in the drum. Syria caused war and turmoil, and many children were invincible in the war. In the face of those children with lack of physical limbs, Monov shed tears. He took the initiative to serve as a project manager of a special foundation and funded donations. In 2020, Monov participated in the activities organized by many institutions such as the Le Charity Disabled Children Foundation and the Syrian Disabled Children Association in Shanghai Hong Kong Square. The Syrian ambassador to China attended. At present, the foundation has installed prosthetic limbs for 15 disabled children. Monav showed me a video of the children who was rescued. He said that he believed that in the near future, his foundation would allow more injured children to be rescued. I asked Monov, what motivation for you to persist for volunteers for more than ten years? Monov smiled mysteriously at me: ""I am studying medicine. I have a study. From a biological perspective, one person can do more good deeds and learn to be a good person, and you can favor his cells. You can activate his own immunity.

Space,"The ""Vegetable Basket""",Space,"These days, the people in Shanghai are fighting. Since yesterday, the first batch of ""three districts"" divided the regional announcement of control and control, and it has been released -the sealing control area, management control area, and prevention area. No matter which area you belong to, the battle is still not over. The soldiers and horses have not moved, and the grain is first. Your ""vegetable basket"", right? Indeed, many friends have encountered a temporary ""vegetable basket"" problem. If there are difficulties, solve the problem. As a result, the unprecedented scale of ""group purchase"" and the ""full star"" tent supermarket, the maximum is basically guaranteed to meet the ""vegetable basket"" just needed in the very period. Since April, from Pudong to Puxi, in the group group of community buildings in large and small, if you want to take stock of ""most attention"", nucleic acid and antigen ranked first; the second ranks, I am afraid that the ""community group purchase"" is Looking around, picking up the dragon, scanning the code, one after another. The ""head of the group"" is mostly residents who live in the same community. They are very enthusiastic. They are ""vegetable baskets"" in the very period. For a while, the ""group group"" also seemed to have become a conditional reflection. When you see the code, he scanned it. When you see the ""group"", it is unusual to join a dozen ""groups"". The successful group is easy to get in the goods. How about the efficiency of the goods is really hard to say. The day I arrived, which made people grateful; there was three more arrival in the middle of the night. ""Passionate"" problem, spontaneous grouping is a way. However, the actual situation of the supplier, the ""head of the group"" can not be the same, whether the supply is sufficient, and whether the channels are unblocked are often unknown. In a very time, it is important to allow the ""vegetable basket"" to receive the ""Xinxin Pill"". Anti -epidemic is to fight, and there is food in your hands without panic. One of the important responsibilities of the government's resistance and organizing concentric resistance is to always adhere to the preparation of the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to ensure the preparation and deployment of life materials to ensure that residents can buy, obtain, afford, and constantly files. How to do it? Conservation, stages, regions, and categories. On the one hand, insist on increasing online channels, large supermarkets and various vegetable market stocks, enhance distribution capabilities, and strive to ensure supply on the surface; on the other hand, focusing on special groups such as the elderly in the control areas, and actively exclude the demand. Do a good job of flexible supply, adhere to the full coverage of not leaking one household, and make every effort to ensure the supply of living materials for residents. However, whether it is ""face"" or ""point"", different in the past, this round of resistance, Shencheng's ""vegetable basket"" guaranteed, the biggest problem is ""last 100 meters"" - ""Express Brother"" who sends things. As a result, ""My head of me, my regiment"", the army suddenly protruded. An interesting phenomenon is that the public account of many community streets has recently received unprecedented attention from residents in the jurisdiction. Because there are heavy releases on the public account -the latest group procurement channels, come! Different from the spontaneous residents, the supply channels for group purchase are mostly endorsed by government credit; the ""head of the regiment"" is also assigned by the neighborhood committee, the industry committee or the property selection; Procurement, the quality of goods, and delivery efficiency, so that the cost -effectiveness and stability of the ""vegetable basket"" in the very period are guaranteed. At the same time, some tent supermarkets driving at the gate of the community also solve the urgent need to protect the eyebrows. At present, Nanqiao Town has opened 45 tent supermarkets, covering 135 communities in the global area. Other streets and towns are planned to open a thousand stores, which seems to be ""full of stars"". The road to confession. "" In March and April 2022, COVID-19 killed the carbine, and the 25 million people in Shencheng put it into the battle. If it is said that the whole population resists, it is a large puzzle, and the word ""victory"" is spent. Anti -disease was originally a great competition for grassroots governance capabilities. The more where the place is planning, scientific scheduling, hard work and hard work, the residents in which place can be more ""heart pill"" and less ""panic"". Moreover, COVID-19 is not the ""last test question"" encountered in the oversized urban social governance. Finally, a photo by the way. A ""Dabai"" said that he was too tired, and he fell asleep on the ground. The photo was taken by a ""head"". The ""vegetable basket"" in the very period is not easy! Remember, only ""group"" necessities, pure water, cola, Sprite and the like, even if. Those consecutive axis ""big white"" are social workers, properties or volunteers. The overload is near the limit. Please take care of them!",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-12/4.htm,4/12/22,The 4th edition: Shanghai News,,True
Space,"The epidemic, let us start paying attention to the people and things around us",Space,"During the control period, people who have always been busy slowly slowed their own steps and were banned from the small square inch. People began to pay attention to the people and things around them. Because of this epidemic, I also entered the WeChat group in the corridor. Because of this epidemic, the residents of our unit building formed a ""community of destiny"". There are a total of 32 households in our unit, and there are more than 90 people and young people. Before entering the group, I was except for several neighbors who were up, down, and right (these neighbors, I also met because of the decoration last year). I didn't know anyone, let alone understand each other. From the beginning of March 15th to the present, although I and many neighbors are still not familiar with each other, some have not been on the top holes so far, but I can already answer with other neighbors in the group, and even dare to follow without. The neighbors who have met the face ""inserted the scripture"". What's more interesting is that I heard in the group that a big brother who lives on the first floor of us was also the Air Force before. He actually had the same occupation with my father -aviation measurement. It's so fate! At that time, I didn't say anything, and immediately added his private WeChat, and then from the task of the Air Force Airlines Troupe to the life of the army's courtyard, a sea chat. ""Far relatives are not as good as neighbors."" Most of us used to understand its meaning in the book. Now, there are difficulties in neighbors. The warmth of followers gives everyone a deep understanding: ""703, do you have ghost dishes, right? The seafood I posted by my family will give you it, I will bring it out when I do a nucleic acid.

There is a girl upstairs for more than a month. I didn't eat meat on the week! ""So, some neighbors helped ask for help in the group:"" That girl said in the group yesterday that she didn't eat meat a few weeks, everyone can help each other. ""Immediately, there would be neighbors answering : ""I fried chicken breasts at night, do more."" That night, the girl ate the fried chicken nuggets from the neighbors. I also added the girl's WeChat in private. She wanted to transfer her hundreds of yuan and let her buy more, but she refused to accept anything. The community distributed love dishes according to one family. There are not enough people who have the lease upstairs. They report to the leader of the building. After a while, the building leader replied: ""I just asked the Secretary of the Resident Commission Zhou just for a while. After a while, I waited for a while. The following security guards will be delivered, you can divide each other. Understand more during the special period. ""The day before yesterday, some common medicines in the hands of neighbors of chronic diseases began to be anxious. They asked for help in the group, so everyone helped to make an idea and find a way that the neighbors with medicine in their hands were even more generous. Faced with thanks, these neighbors said: ""Everyone is not easy now. It is fate to be able to live in a building."" ""Money does not need, neighbors, and help each other to help each other. . ""The veteran elder brother living on the first floor, during the period of this epidemic, was voluntarily served as a"" mobile whistle, supervisor, courier, buyer ...

Yeah, for many years, we have lived in the high -rise building of reinforced concrete casting. Many people's life models, many people, including me, have lived in one place for many years, and even the neighbors' name and who are who are not clear, let alone contact. This outbreak asked everyone to retrieve the long -lost neighborhood. I think that after the epidemic, the relationship between neighbors will definitely change.

I have a rare glands -like cystic cancer (referred to as ACC), which is a type of oral cancer. Due to the number of hospitals that can treat this disease across the country, I rushed to Shanghai from Guangzhou with my family. I currently rent No. 227, Lieqiao Village, Kangqiao Town, Pudong. However, due to the epidemic control and traffic control, there are many difficulties on the road to medical treatment. Can the kind people in Shanghai help me!

The radiotherapy plan of 30 times in 45 days has now been made 8 times. However, due to the recent road closure control, it is very difficult to rush from Pudong to Puxi. After receiving the help, the reporter asked Mr. Zheng to make a report to the neighborhood committee where the rental place was located, and reported to the nearest medical resources after reporting to the street town.

Is the connection vehicle sent by the local area? The roar of the engine is getting closer and closer, and the door of the square cabin hospital slowly opens. ""You have worked hard, thank you!"" Thanks for the ""big white"" that accompanied for many days, you three steps and two steps, and briskly appear on The car waves out of the window, and it is some of the way here -now, the health monitoring of 7 days of healthy is successful, and your personal ""war"" will be successful. The Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission reported that yesterday, 334 cases were discharged from the city in the city, and 6,044 cases were dismissed from quarantine medicine. Since March 1, more than 20,000 people have been discharged and lifted in isolation medicine. Our hometown has been more than 20,000 new infections for many consecutive days. According to the latest research and judgment of the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism, the epidemic is still in a rapid rise. It is expected that the number of new infections in the next few days will still be at a high level. Under the haze of the epidemic, the news of the discharge seemed to try to open the light of the clouds and fog, bringing hope and confidence. At the Fang Cabin Hospital of the Urban Football Museum, after 5 days of opening, 196 patients were discharged at the standard; at the New Guopa Cabin Hospital, hundreds of patients were on the way back to return yesterday. Li Zhiqiang said that the aid medical staff, volunteers and patients for Shanghai have formed a brave and responsible group. I hope that everyone will continue to unite closely, recover the cabin as soon as possible, and return to normal life. COVID-19 patients were discharged from discharged by two consecutive nucleic acid tests. The results were negative, and the sampling time was at least 24 hours. The symptoms of the respiratory tract were significantly improved for 3 consecutive days. Generally speaking, those with mild and asymptomatic infections can obtain a ""anti -epidemic certificate"" in about 7 days through isolation medical observation and combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine at the square cabin hospital. As the operation of the square -cabin hospital is becoming more mature, the docking of patients after discharge is smoother. But there are also sounds that their regression will affect neighbors and the environment? These voices made the originally brisk return, and the pressure also added the guilt and apology that the innocent infected people were unnecessary. But in fact, many medical experts ""platforms"" for them: discharges and discharges and discharged medical observers have no impact on neighbors and the environment, and they should not be afraid or discriminated. The Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission also made three orders: the territory must be connected, allowing them to go home, not to block, and care about them, and cooperate with their home health monitoring at the same time. Yesterday, 39 ""Anti -Epidemic Warriors"" in W2 ""Parent -Chile"" of the New Guobo Bo Fang Hospital jumped out of the ward. Wang Wei, the leader of the medical team of Shanghai Children's Medical Center, said that after the patient was discharged from the hospital, the medical staff would kill the bed. In the afternoon, the patient was admitted to the hospital. ""The arrangement is very close."" Yes, in the confrontation with Omikon, we must raise speed! Only when the healing person can return, the newly discovered infected person will be treated for the first time, and the beds of the squares hospital will quickly turn around, so that ""the acceptance and the separation should be accepted"" more powerful, so that the virus can be effectively cut off. spread.

Space,Is there a bird sounding outside your window?,Space,"Do you believe? The sound is also temperature. What is the best voice in your memory? The child's first cry, the Bund's big bell, the stream of the mountains, the blending of the waves and the wind, and even the flute of the Pujiang River ... Now, for me, the best voice is to receive it in the last week. In all corners of Shanghai, more than 200 bird videos and recording. In my opinion, this is a stubborn and warm life in the daily life of Shanghai people. On April 3rd, a usual afternoon in a sealing control, I suddenly heard a long -lost bird sounding on the balcony at home, so clear and pleasant, I quickly pulled out my phone and recorded it, and then sent it to my friends and relatives around me. With the circle of friends, I got a lot of likes and feedback. Late at night that day, there was a student privately message me: ""I am isolating in the dormitory, and the birds shared by the teacher are very moved. There is nothing in Jiangnan, and I will give me a spring. Share it to the teacher, I hope you are happy every day."" I am happy. ""I I opened her recording and listened to the bird's bird's sounding. I was moved and happy, and a thought of jumping out of my head: How good everyone is here to convey the birds? So, I wrote the text to solicit recording: ""If you are willing, please use your mobile phone to record the birds he heard and share the beauty around you. Together and pass it together."" This is the sustainable sustainable promotion of the current promotion. Sexual public co -creation art ""Bird Ming Radio"", which originated from individuals and friends, developed on social media. I think this is part of ""discovering the beauty around you"" and Sharing and healing. Today, my daily work is to sort out the audio and videos, check and correct the text information of the recording data in time, and edit the audio file editing into a video. Record the author, point, and file name. The anchor is not easy. But I will insist on doing it. When it is unblocked, these materials can be made in the theater, which can be played in the shopping malls and public spaces such as office buildings and communities. This is a transmission and a record. Many people are physically and mentally exhausted because of the spread of the epidemic and negative information on the Internet. I hope that these birds will pass on a force to the city. Many enthusiastic friends in the circle of friends, including some public welfare institutions, schools, and art galleries have added this relay of love. These videos and audio reminds us that the love of this city is eternal. Inject hope, just as the birds outside the window continue to sing.

Space ,Cancer girl's belly swelling like a ball and a multi -party to help chemotherapy. ,,"I asked my 5 -year -old daughter to be found in the late stage of liver cell tumor and had metastasized. More than a month ago, I took my daughter to the Shanghai Children's Medical Center for medical treatment. After a course of chemotherapy, the condition improved. However, due to the sealing of the hospital, her daughter had to stop chemotherapy for nearly a week. Seeing that her stomach was swollen like a basketball, I was really anxious, I really hope that someone can help my daughter! Mr. Liu, Shandong Province, helped >>> Mr. Liu told reporters that her daughter was diagnosed with liver celloma in Shandong. ""At that time, the daughter's stomach was enlarged and the mental condition was not very good. The doctor said that if this goes on, the belly may be ruptured at any time, which is life -threatening."" So, Mr. Liu took his 5 -year -old daughter on February 24 this year, Return from Shandong to Shanghai. Subsequently, the father and daughter rented a house on Linyi Road near the hospital. ""At that time, the daughter's cancer was late, and the cancer cells had metastasized to the lungs. On March 9th, the first chemotherapy began. Then we were told to be discharged and waited for the next chemotherapy."" The reporter understood it In the case, chemotherapy must be implemented in four phases. After the first chemotherapy, it was a 15 -day ""suppression period"". Mr. Liu took his daughter to rest in the rental house. In the blink of an eye, it was almost April 4th. This is the second day of chemotherapy treatment, but the hospital came from the hospital: Due to the positive cases, the ward needs to be closed for a period of time, and chemotherapy cannot be hospitalized for the time being.

Space,Under the ancient cypress tree,Space,"Compared with other parks, Xiao Fuxing and other parks. In the early spring of the world, there is no other flower blooming except for sporadic spring flowers. Magnolia in Zhai Palace will wait until the end of March. It can only be seen in the middle. The gray heavenly altar, at this time, relies on the ancient tree to get angry. This is indeed unable to match any other parks. For such ancient trees, there are 3562 plants in the world. If it wasn't for the chaotic erosion of artificial war and natural disasters in the long -term building of the Temple of Heaven, the number of ancient trees should be more. The most anticipated ancient tree in the heavenly altar is the cypress Huaihuai on the north side of the promenade, and the Kowloon cypress outside the echo wall. The ancient trees there, because they were too famous, were surrounded by iron railings, and people could not contact them intimately. For me, the most favorite is the three Gubai outside the West Chai Herhen Gate. For so many years, almost every time I arrived at the Temple, I will look at these three Guba, as if they are my storm; sometimes they draw them, they always paint, and they are not like. In the Temple of Heaven, there are two pieces of Chaihe Libn Gate, which are listed on both sides of the east and west sides of the wall of the palace. At the beginning, it provided firewood for sacrifice for sacrifice for sacrifice to killing and cooking cowckers. These two doors are now in the office of the Temple of Heaven. There are clean and hygienic tricycles in the door of Xichaihe Railway, which is not open to the public. Therefore, the tourists here are almost nothing. In front of the door, three Gubai, arranged from east to west, winter and summer, spring and autumn, dense branches and leaves, lush, like three mighty strong men, standing there, the lawn is like a red wall, the red wall is like blood, there is a difficulty of difficulty The vicissitudes of vicissitudes. Especially in the spring, the tender green of grass, the green of the tree, the redness of the wall, and the green of tiles, and the color is strong and vivid. I always think that the color of the heavenly altar is the best. These three thick cubes are very old. One is more than 560 years and two or more. Throughout the Temple of Heaven, it is difficult to find such a long -standing ancient tree standing side by side together. At noon at the Women's Day on the Women's Day, I passed the Gate of Huajianan from the south, walked along a slippery red wall, and walked to the corner of the wall, and I could see these three ancient trees. Suddenly, at a glance, a girl stood in front of the old cypress. She stood quietly, motionless, stood for a long time, and always looked up at the crown. I stood there, and I didn't want to disturb her. I have rarely seen tourists here, and I have never seen anyone standing there quietly and looking up at the trees. I saw the girl moved and turned around slowly, her arm stroked the cracked old trunk from time to time. That looks like the child surrounds the old man's knees, and the old tree becomes kindly kind, telling her about the past. The wind blows lightly, and the branches and leaves move. The sunlight at noon spilled on her face and body through the branches and leaves. Because she was walking around, the sun jumped from time to time, and she went smoothly for a while, and her backlighting face and body, like a butterfly flipping. Suddenly I was a little moved, for this girl, and for this ancient tree. The girl was so awesome about the ancient trees. Ancient trees are worthy of girls. However, now, many of us seem to have no feeling or lack of such awe. We are generally willing to worship the god statue, but we do not know that the trees are particularly ancient. In fact, it is also the god of nature. In front of nature, people are small. In front of the ancient trees with 5-6 hundred years, people are also small. Thinking of the ancient Roman philosopher Augustine, he was ashamed of lust and wanted to worship in front of God. He did not go to the church's cross, but fell down under a fig tree. I also think of the ancient Roman poet Ovid, the old couples of Federer and Bamkas written in his great poem ""Transformed"", hoping that he would not become something else after his death, but only turned into it, but only turned into it. The two trees in the temple, one oak tree, and a cricket tree. In that distant era, the trees are so awesome. In today's business age, trees are just a kind of commodity, or ornamental products, and are no longer a god of nature. We will no longer call the trees as Shenmu, let alone kneel down under a tree, or hope that we will become a tree after death. I saw the girl walking around in front of this Gubai and walking to the second one, and she had been walking around silently before these three Gubai. When I passed by her, I greeted her. She stood up and asked me politely. I talked with her a few briefly, knowing that she came to Beijing from Shanghai to play in Beijing during the holiday. I just wanted to ask her why she was so interested in these three ancient trees. But she asked me first: Do you know that there are still older trees in the world than these three ancient trees? I told her that there was not far away in front of the Gubai who was about to fall down but still alive, it was worth seeing. She couldn't wait to say goodbye to me. The girl is less than thirty, with good faces, ponytails, sportswear, white sports pants, red sports velvet jackets, plus a beige vest, a white baseball cap, a brown back with brown back with brown back Backpacks, the three green cypresses that are green like deep lakes, and the red wall, and the green lawn, the color is diverse, like a strange seven -color flower in full bloom. These days, the epidemic in Shanghai was serious. Suddenly, I thought of the girl.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-13/6.htm,4/13/22,The 6th edition: Nightlight Cup,,True
Space ,,,"The elderly Zhou Huacheng has a cherished attitude towards farmers. In addition to the heart, this is also awe. For example, if a flat -handed manner fell to the ground, the child was about to cross, and the adult would stop it in time and erected flat and respectfully on the corner. Children naturally do not understand why, and adults do not know, they just feel that it is a taboo. Life in the countryside often has some taboos. For example, a grain of rice falls on the ground, and the feet cannot be stepped on; for example, you cannot whistle at night; for example, you cannot use your fingers to the moon, otherwise the moon will cut people's ears; It should be picked up and stuffed into the paper basket or corner -although it is now thinking about it, many of the agreed taboos are unreasonable, and many of them are superstitious ingredients, but they actually spread. This makes the lives of village people have a lot of rituals in it, and there are many particular attention, making life very solemn. Why not let the flat burden be allowed to cross it? I later read a paper (Ding Xiaolei, Sun Jian, and Wang Siming, ""The Cultural Performance and Significance of Jiangnan River's Folk Tools Folk Heritage"", China Agricultural History 2015). There are gods, and there is a ""flat manner"" in the flat burden, also known as ""the master of flat burden"". The awe of ""Bian Dan"" is reflected in the daily usage customs. For example, in some places, if you accidentally cross the burden of others, the perpetrators will be asked to bear a risk, that is, if the burden of the shoulder should have sores on the shoulder within a month, the medical expenses and misunderstanding costs will be used. The perpetrators should be borne by the perpetrator. As a sickle, there is also a ""sickle god"". According to the old man, the sickle cannot be grinded before harvesting the rice. It must be used after use. If it is not used after being grinded, it will be grinded again, called ""grinding heavy knife"", this kind of knife is easy to hurt people. Therefore, some elderly people are particularly particular about it. After the knife is grinded, they are drawn a few times with the tip of the knife, indicating that they have been used, and then they will be used with confidence. Similarly, the rice barrels and granary are used as a tool for storing food, and they have settled in the ""valley god"". The rice barrel is the most important farm tool in farmers' homes. Recently, I read a book of rice -made culture and saw the book saying that the folks in Dongyang, Zhejiang believed that Gu Shen was not in the temple, but attached to the rice barrel. In my hometown of Luzhou, there have been many particular attention in the past, such as not too casual rice barrels. Even if it is a child, you can't put your feet on the rice barrel, otherwise you are disrespectful. The barn and rice cylinder must not sit on it. Even for the rice tube in the rice tank, you must not be placed randomly. You must treat it well. Only in this way can you ensure that the rice cylinder is not empty. The rice tube can always scoop out the rice with white flowers. Dravi God, in the vast area of rice in China, has a wide range of mass foundations -in the intangible cultural heritage project of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, there are ""Manga Festival"". Come to pray for the giving harvest of the King of Rice. In ancient times, King Zongya was the rice god. June of the lunar calendar is the key time season for rice to pump and promote flowers. It determines whether the food can be harvested in harvest. The blessing of God. Therefore, farm tools are more symbols, even if they are a hoe, a burden, and a flat burden. They should be cherished. If farmers do not cherish their labor tools and do not love to take care of them, how can they do a good job of agriculture? It seems that I entered the news industry at the beginning of a decade ago. An old photographer said that the camera was his weapon. Even if it fell into the river once, the whole person was soaked, and the camera was still by him by him. Holding one hand high, unscathed. This is a person's highest respect for his profession. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that when my father wrote on agricultural tools (commonly known as ""number""), it was so solemn. As far as I see, the simplest one is to write the owner's name on the burden, baskets, and windmills, and write more about ""some, so, and so"", and the year and month; In terms of the windmill, ""Sichuan flows endlessly"", ""remove the floating real"", the rice barrel is written ""Grapho Feng Deng"", and the barn is written on the barn, ""The Year of the Grand"" and ""Jingu Mancang"". Some scholars believe that rice -made agricultural tools have a long history and have a long history, starting in the Song Dynasty, and flourishing with the development of Jiangnan. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, it was the most prosperous and became a cultural activity agreed by the masses. In fact, I would like to say that the so -called ""cultivation of heirs"" and the so -called ""sunny and rainy reading"". Two things are reflected in a small agricultural tool. As a cultural sense, the education of farming labor, through agricultural tools, subtly pass the essence of its essence to the children in the country, and spread it from generation to generation. Today, few people will notice what else is there. Even children will not believe that there are ""gods"" in the burden, which is the progress of the times. However, sometimes the times go too fast and leave a lot of things. Stop, think about it, where do you do not understand the truth for generations. They often say, ""Three feet with gods"", where do you not know the truth -just see through without saying a break. Or, they are not respecting a specific ""god"", but a sense of ritual of life, a awe of farming life. Only in this way, only the rules of acting, and the truth of being a person.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-13/7.htm,4/13/22,第7版:夜光杯,,True

Why has the long -term control of Space,Why is there a long time to keep in the community?,"Municipal disease control: data delay, family communication more, items or pollution","This morning, the 153rd COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control press conference was held in Shanghai. Essence On April 13, 2573 COVID-19 local confirmed cases and 25,146 were infected with asymptomatic infections. Among the 2573 confirmed cases, 2200 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 259 cases were found in the screening of nucleic acid screening in related risks that 114 cases were asymptomatic infected. Among the 25146 cases of asymptomatic infection, 24,548 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 598 cases were found in the screening of related risk groups of nucleic acid screening. Yesterday, 737 cases were discharged from the city and 15,406 cases were discharged from centralized isolation medicine. They would return to the place of residence to receive health monitoring. In the Q & A session, there were questions from reporters, why have a positive infection constantly appearing in the community for a long time? Wu Huanyu, deputy director of the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that there are mainly these three reasons -one is that the screening data has a certain delay. Nucleic acid screening work is very large. If there is a positive mixed pipe after inspection, it is also necessary to make a single check and review. For the detected positive personnel, the positive personnel should further conduct an epidemiological investigation and collect accurate related medical information and personal information. At the same time, you must also complete the work of the report. Second, there are family aggregate communication. The strain that caused this round of epidemic is Omikon BA.2 mutant strains, which have the characteristics of strong hidden and fast spread. Most of the incubation period we observe is 3-5 days. Family dissemination is currently the main communication channel.

For freshness, a pot of chicken soup was burned overnight, and a bowl of chicken soup noodles were eaten in the morning. How can I know that something has come. Property management calls chickens, saying that this chicken is ordered by Room 301. I was shocked, and this courier box was clearly written in Room 501. In fact, the delivery person wrote wrong. This chicken is indeed room 301. His son called and said that the chicken he ordered would not express it at 1 pm. Oops, this chicken is not a chicken, and it is mixed back and forth. I want to pay Room 301 and review the reckless things. My wife recommends sending half of the chickens to return the owner. I said it didn't need it, my wife said it was needed, and the two were arguing. This incident was not good, and the neighbors had to be ""jumping chickens and dogs"", with red ears.

Give the chickens sent by the son; 2. The neighbors eat each other without losing a friendly exchange; Disposal, let's talk about it; 5. Friendly negotiation is the best way to solve; 6. Give half of the people who have not burned, send half of the son, and give people one chicken and two chickens. 7. Send half, and pay for the whole chicken, which is perfect; 8. In order to avoid the suspect of infection, half of the left can not be delivered; 10. What is lacking now is that the supplies are not money, you have to pay back the chickens; 11.

Under the leadership of the neighborhood committees, thousands of residents in our community do not go out closed and guard against death. In the case of surrounded by surroundings, we maintain the clear reputation of ""one side of the pure land"". Everyone was looking at each other, and it was full of pride. Unexpectedly, ""Break"" suddenly appeared: neighbors A lived in the city center, and a certain day of self -feelings. I went to the municipal hospital for nucleic acid testing. here). The most difficult thing to understand is that after she entered the community, she didn't say anything, but quietly lined up into the team to test the nucleic acid test with us ... Until that day, the city center ""Bai Bai"" and the police car drove into our community. The positive report detected by municipal hospitals can only be the truth. The neighbors exploded this time: Why did A return to hide from the report, and do not report it, and do it do a nucleic acid test with us? ""Pure Land"" was broken, and the hearts were stunned; what was even more worrying was that neighbors who were tested with A were positive. Obviously, the risk of virus transmission is expanding. Later, it was detected, and even two mixed inspection tubes were abnormal, which means that 20 residents will receive re -examination! 20, which 20 are it? Neighbors are eager to know their house number. Because the ""break"" brought by A makes every inch of air above the community full of weird variables. At this time, neighbors B sent a letter in the group -dear neighbors: Yesterday, my three people participated in nucleic acid testing. Today, I reported that my husband was negative. My daughter and I are at home, wearing a mask, and not turning on the air conditioner; my husband lives in the other room. Please pay attention to the protection.

In the first few days, the ringtone of the peak period made my ears buzzing, and countless answers and sending orders almost collapsed my brain.

More than double, reaching the highest in history. ""Time is life, and ringtones are commands.""

To extract valid information from the family's call in the shortest time, and sort out emergency and non -emergency situations, not only the citizen's emotions on the phone, but I must always suppress my inner anxiety, listen patiently, and listen patiently.

They eat and live in the unit. They often work hard to answer the phone while ""swallowing rice"". They are undoubtedly the people who speak the most in Shanghai.

Like everyone, to overcome the physiological discomfort during pregnancy, stick to the scheduling position, everyone is worried about her body, she always answered: ""I have good physical fitness, yes!"" Due to the long -term sitting sitting for a long time, I sat sitting for a long time. Many people suffer from chronic diseases, and some gurgling drinking water is because the blood sugar is high; some hold the waist and stand on the acceptance call because the lumbar spondylosis is ""looking for the door"". But they always insisted on, insisted, and then insisted, no one fell. In order to cope with the amount of surge, the city 120 emergency center and the same administrative staff of me also rushed on the front line, her throat was dumb, her eyes were swollen, and the gums were swollen. That medical is white. Everyone is doing their best to answer each phone in time to ensure that the patient's information collection is completed in the shortest time, asking the main complaint, asking the address, contact information, etc., and sending a first -aid car as soon as possible. I deeply realized that those who can persist in this post are based on responsibility, but also because of the awe of life and a strong love for the city. In the phone I received, there were covid-19 patients for help, some citizens with physical discomfort and suddenly felt difficulty in breathing, some quasi-mothers who were closed to break the calmness, and some funny cats were caught. Little boys ... Some patients with minor injuries have dealt with the wounds by self -disinfection, bandaging and other operations through telephone guidance; some people take the initiative to cancel the call through the help of the community. They said that in a special period, the valuable resources of ambulances must be left to those who really need it. During the volunteer, in fact, more of the work of soothing and consulting. Every time I answer the phone, I have to take a deep breath to calm down. Although many citizens are facing various difficulties, they all restrain their emotions and work hard.

The hope of sending the whole family for Ms. Wang, who had been waiting on the roadside, and a 24 -hour love relay led by the Xinmin Evening News ""War Epidemic · Bang Nong"". Successfully. The whole city was difficult to find in the city in 2021. Ms. Wang's daughter and Xiaofang, who was 30 years old, unfortunately suffered from uremia. After a year of waiting, at the beginning of this year, Xiaofang underwent renal transplant surgery at Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University. According to the doctor's order, after half a year after kidney transplantation, Xiaofang needed to take the Disposable tablets of Genchenolova every day to prevent postoperative infection. Originally, she was more convenient to buy medicines from JD.com every month, but due to the impact of the epidemic, the new batch of drugs failed to arrive. The price of this medicine is more than 30 yuan, which is not expensive, but due to strong targetedness, there are not many major hospitals. The family searched all the hospitals and network channels in Shanghai, and they were all out of stock. What happened in the event of a daughter's suspension of drugs, Ms. Wang did not dare to imagine. Seeing that the pill box was about to the bottom, she took the mentality of trying to ask for help from the Xinmin Evening News. The road to seeking medicine across Shanghai and Hangzhou was at noon the day before yesterday. After receiving the help of Ms. Wang, the reporter contacted the resources of all parties on the one hand. On the one hand, through various channels such as the circle of friends and the WeChat group, Ms. Wang asked the medicine together. ""Can't you try it from other places? Please help the Shanghai Medical Team?"" ""I found this, and I would like to ask the doctor if they could not replace it!"" The circle of friends of the reporter was surrounded by enthusiasm. After contacting the enthusiastic citizen, Ms. Hao, Foshang Shangxun Taiyun COO He Qiang heard a helping hand. He Qiang said that the company's company focuses on the home health consumer product line directly and the full supply chain service, and has rich channel resources. ""I try my best to find it, wait for my news!"" Online channels? No! Hospital warehouse? No! Continue to find it, continue to ask, the phone has been hit from Shanghai to Zhejiang. At 9 o'clock the night before, He Qiang excitedly told reporters that his persistence was finally effective -in the pharmacy in Xiaoshan Hospital in Zhejiang, there was medicine! Coincidentally, the company happened to have a truck from Hangzhou to Shanghai the next day. As long as you can catch up, the medicine can be sent to Shanghai! Zhao Gang, the person in charge of Yunlin Quality, is a novice dad. Although he needs to take care of his wife and children, in order to send a life -saving medicine to the Shanghai girl who lives, he actively invited him in Hangzhou. In the early morning of yesterday, he drove more than an hour to the hospital for Xiaofang for a good medicine, and took another hour to send the medicine to the truck. Police cars help the completion of the relay affected by traffic control. How can the medicine be transported from Songjiang warehouse to Pudong? After receiving the help of reporters, the Songjiang Public Security Branch and the Pudong Public Security Branch happily agreed: the last love relay, we take over! ""The truck has set off."" ""The vehicle has arrived in the Songjiang warehouse to complete the transfer."" ""Pudong has set off!"" This bag of Genxirovirville's scattered tablets may never think that his ""footprint"" will receive so many concerns. At 5 pm yesterday, Pudong Heqing Town. ""If there is anything else to help during the epidemic, you can also find us!"" After receiving the medicine, he heard the police's warm words, Ms. Wang cried excitedly. In the circle of friends, she left a gratitude from the heart, ""The epidemic is ruthless, the world is affectionate, loves and has no different love, and selfless dedication!""

Space,Home Flowers and Plants,Space,"Earlier last month, Dai Rong had not moved in Bai Yulan in Fudan Garden. I hope that I have eager to buy magnolia branches from Yunnan. Those branches that are tingling are half tall, and the branches are covered with light brown buds with a brush -shaped tip. According to the shopkeeper's instructions, the flowers were soaked in the deepest barrel at home for a long time, and the water was changed, sprayed with water, and cut pruning. I looked forward to the buds of the buds, and broke the imprisonment of the bracts and opened it into white flowers. The Ming people Cheng Yuwen's ""Flower Moon Order"" recorded the ""Magnolia Solution"" in February of the lunar calendar, simply a single ""solution"", but it made people feel vivid. However, it may be that the temperature in Shanghai is too low, and this magnolia has not blossomed. Asked the owner whether the method of raising flowers was improper, they did not say anything, and immediately said that I would change me for free. ""Give you a bunch of Ao Mei, good for raising, and long flowering period."" After launching sale, it is exempted from choice difficulty and unnecessary tangles. It is really a good thing for Liu Danming in this extraordinary spring. The Australian Mei was beautiful, and the pink flowers were brought out the next day. I did not expect that it had been shaking for a few weeks later, and it became an inconvenient day to accompany my table flowers. Before the cherry blossoms on the campus opened, the school started a quasi -closed management model. Fortunately, colleagues and students stationed on campus from time to time ""live broadcast"" flowers through the circle of friends, from the initial buds to semi -open and bloom. Perhaps the scope of activities is small, and there are fewer miscellaneous things. They cherish flowers and spring light than previous years. I couldn't go out of the outdoor to see the flowers for the time being. Jasmine's old branches burst out of the new buds of sesame. The duck grass is higher than the day every day. In this summer, the blue flowers will be bloomed. The first year is cut from the roadside. Must be ruthless. The new leaves of rosemary made me a little bit stunned. If I thought that if I cut off a few branches to my friends earlier, he could sprinkle a little green and fragrant on the steak recently. He said that steak is the most high -quality protein he has to stock up. It is a pity that the empty flower pot in the corner of the flower frame is unfortunate, and the green onions bought in Chongming Farm were planted and planted. The marks left by these plants are quite simple in line with the seemingly simple, sometimes luxurious ""flowers on the table, vegetables in the bowl"". Knowing that I love flowers, someone sent me a set of magazine pictures, and each of them was holding a bouquet of a woman. Those chrysanthemums, hydrangea, roses, and sword orchids are quite amazing, almost covering people's upper body. If you hold something else, you can't help but be embarrassed, but because it is a flower, it looks quite graceful. I sent my new book to my friends in Beijing. She took a illustration in the book and asked me what the blue -purple grass flower was called. ""Arab mother -in -law."" A few days later, she sent photos of Arab mother -in -law on the wild. I asked her to pay tribute to those little flowers on behalf of me. In Shanghai this spring, it is lucky to buy flowers who buy flowers before the flower shop stops. If there is no flower, the trees that look at the window on the balcony will be a retreat and tenacity. ""No spring will not come.""

Shenzhou -thirteen manned flying task has achieved successful success,"Space business trip for half a year, three people returned home",Space,"At 9:56 today, Shenzhou -thirteen manned spacecraft returned to the cabin to successfully land in the Dongfeng landing field. On -site medical supervisors and medical insurance staff confirmed that astronauts Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu had a good physical condition. Intersection At 11:05, the astronauts went out of the cabin safely by the group. Zhai Zhigang's first out of the cabin, he said with a full spirit: ""I am proud of our great motherland!"" Wang Yaping, the second out of the cabin, said: ""The 183 -day space journey is very difficult, but we are not alone. Back to the arms of the motherland, I was very happy. I want to tell my daughter that the mother who picks the stars is back! ""Ye Guangfu's third out of the cabin, he said affectionately:"" I realized the dream of flying sky and can proudly report to the motherland. We are currently. The body is very good and strive to make better results in the future. ""Step by step is at 0.44 today, Shenzhou 13 manned spacecraft and the space station sky and the core cabin successfully separated. The road of Shenzhou 13 is simply divided into four steps. The first step is to return separation and brake adjustment. After the manned spacecraft is separated from the core compartment combination of the space station, the first adjustment should be performed. After the direction is adjusted, the orbital compartment is separated from the return capsule, and the adjustment position is made again. After that, the cabin system was launched, and the return cabin entered the return orbit from the original flight track. This process is called braking off -track. The return cabin can only return to the earth with a suitable angle with the geocentrus of the earth. The second step is to push back the separation. When 145 kilometers from the ground, promote the separation of the compartment and the return capsule. The return capsule continues to go home alone. It will enter the atmosphere about 100 kilometers from the ground. The surroundings of the return capsule were surrounded by flames, and it looked like a fireball. The third step is to open the umbrella. At 10 kilometers away from the ground, a large umbrella of 1,200 square meters is opened, and the spacecraft returns to the back compartment to continue to slow down. The fourth step is about 1 meter from the ground, starting 4 anti -push engines to perform the last deceleration, and the spacecraft landed safely. In this process, the biggest challenge facing astronauts is overload and impact. In the process of pushing back, the return capsule and the air rubbed severe friction, which made the temperature at the bottom of the back cabin as high as thousands of degrees Celsius. The return capsule will also enter the lost ""black barrier area"". This stage is the most dangerous step in the entire return process. The astronauts who return to the cabin must bear the pressure of 4 times their weight, to bear the severe vibration, and enter the state of loss. Essence During the last 10 kilometers of the return, the moment the return cabin parachute was opened, the aerospace staff's body had to undergo a large overload instantly. When landing, the astronauts had to bear a violent impact. Returning to Shenzhou 13 is not only the longest spacecraft in my country, but also the fastest spacecraft to return. Compared with Shenzhou 12 manned spacecraft, Shenzhou -13 manned spacecraft uses a fast return mode. Under the condition of not changing hardware software, returning to the earth is shortened from 18 laps to 5 laps, and the return time is shortened for nearly 20 hours for nearly 20 hours. Essence Experts introduced that the spacecraft flying around the earth is to wait for the opportunity to return. At the same time, the ground also needs to carry out preparations such as parameter injection and strategy formulation during this time. By reasonable cutting and adjustment of the flight task event, the compressed operation time is reduced to 5 laps, which not only improves the return of the return task execution efficiency, but also makes the astronauts return to experience more comfortable. In addition, in the past, the spacecraft and the space station realized the connection. The position of the radar and telescope needed to determine the position. ""Take the calculation"", adjust the track a little bit, shorten the distance until the docking. Today, the Beidou system can give the position of the space station and spacecraft very accurately, and the calculation is in place. The return of the three astronauts safely not only means that the task of Shenzhou 13 is successfully concluded, but also another layer of significance: the key technical verification stage of the China Space Station was successfully ended. China Aerospace Science and Technology Group revealed that the manned space space station project will complete 6 major tasks this year, including two cargo spacecraft, Shenzhou 14 and Shenzhou 15 twice, including Tianzhou -4 and Tianzhou 5. Sky Experimental Curring I, Mengtian Experimental Curm II launch, and the docking of the Rail Communication Fair, the outlet event and the return mission of the spacecraft, will be fully built this year.

Space,Sticking together,Space,"I have a lot of time in Shanghai recently because I am writing a ""big book"" about Shanghai. From March 16th, I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel in Pudong. Unexpectedly, it was more than thirty days in this room. Three or four days before March 28, we discovered a positive patient, so my building was sealed. Looking out of my current room, how beautiful the spring outside, bird language, but I can only look out in this room. The grass and trees in the city stood silently with us, and they were still growing up and sticking to the city. I have two things every day. One is the content of the interview some time before the consolidation, the other is to consolidate the idea, and the other is to pay attention to the epidemic of Shanghai. As a writer, this epidemic affects my writing, and frequently goes downstairs to nucleic acids every day, making my heart unable to calm down for a long time. The epidemic in Shanghai has a direct relationship with everyone who lives here. I think of the epidemic that I have experienced several epidemics and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. The epidemic is different from the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2003, I talked about the panic of the people at the time in the ""Beijing Defense War"" I wrote. The time node of the Shanghai epidemic is almost the same, how similar people's thoughts are. This is my personal experience. But the time difference has been different for nearly two decades. The epidemic in Shanghai has spread wider, and the personal feelings brought differently. Either the epidemic in Shanghai or the SARS epidemic. I think that the common thing is that we will be able to win. As a person in the epidemic, I may have more historical dimensions about the incidents. When we look at Shanghai, we must look objectively and comprehensively. There are many noodles in Shanghai, don't just see the side of its bustling city. Shanghai has experienced many pains and disasters in history. My ancestors have struggled in Shanghai and experienced the disaster again and again. For New China, countless Shanghai children have presented their lives. Shanghai is a great city. In the past few days, I wrote the latest article ""When Difficulties, We Pay more to the Spirit of Shanghai"", the spirit of the Shanghai spirit has been settled in history. In difficulties, the Shanghai spirit can show its strength and richness. Now is the darkness before dawn, the darkness will disappear soon, I believe this. In 2020, I wrote two books, ""Shanghai Emoticon"" and ""First Time"" to record the history of the Shanghai prevention and control epidemic. When I was writing, I have been observing. I sincerely feel that Shanghai has done well. I do n’t panic, there is a way, a way, intelligent, capable, and resources, but a city that sings Kaige There are always some setbacks, just like each of us. Now that I am writing this new book, I have been thinking about such a question: How should we look at the city of Shanghai? Faced with this epidemic, we received extremely rare lessons. Such an experience and lessons need to be carefully summarized. For the urban development of our later, a modern city, a people -centered city, how to summarize is better, which is of great significance.

Space,"anxiety does not get angry, we admire more",Space,"Deng Weizhi recently sent me to the group of friends. I wrote the brush ""anxiety is easy to get angry, everyone understands; anxiety does not get angry, we admire more."" Several group friends have proposed one after another and told me to say that I wrote about the background of these two sentences. Essence Turkly, I think about it. No one is not worried about the outbreak, no one is anxious or anxious, although the degree of anxiety and anxiety is different. Heart palpitations, panic, and uncertain mind, it is easy to feel irritable. In this case, words and deeds are easy to excite. This is understandable. But people! The more you are in danger, the more you must be calm, calm, and calm. It is necessary to deal with the relationship between managers and residents, the relationship between medical staff and patients, the relationship between foreign supporters and receptionists, and everyone holds the group to warm up. In order to regulate the mood, home staff may wish to listen to music, watch comedy and comedy on TV, and let the laughter echo on both sides of the Pujiang River. There are more or less disrupted events, and there will be disorder. In this case, learn to change and respond. However, it is not easy to do this. However, no matter how difficult it is, we must work hard in this regard, so as not to be busy or not, the order of changes is orderly, and the order is established. If there is controversy, it is necessary to treat it rationally and distinguish the priority. Also, rumors will inevitably increase when disrupting the routine. There is a test of social psychology, and it is said that it must go five times. Han Zheyi, Secretary of the East Bureau in the early 1960s, educated us to learn a story when we have to learn first -hand information. The troops were running on the night, and the horse's puppets in the third class fell. Lian Jian said: ""Board backwards, see the horses of the third class, pick it up."" As a result, there were a few people that passed on, so he heard the strange things: ""Sima Yi's pants are dropped, what about us?"" Become a rumor.

It is true that the nerves have emerged when they are raising prices. Since March 14, the market regulatory authorities have issued reminders to various market entities more than 40,000 copies, and more than 200 cases have been investigated. Typical cases of violations of law have been announced. For example, in the Jin Xiaowen restaurants, in the case of the price case, the parties' entrance price of only 3 yuan per catty was sold on the takeaway platform for a price of 16.8 yuan per catty. The Minhang Police, in conjunction with the relevant departments, discovered that a fruit shop opened the seal without authorization under the drive of the interests, opened the door to open the door, and sold a green vegetable to 26 yuan, which made people unyielding. In the ""community group purchases"" that are in wind and water, there are endless chaos such as sitting on the ground, raising prices, and short lack of two pounds. For example, in recent days, Yan received a 1720 vegetable package order, which agreed to include two pounds of celery, two pounds of white radish, one pound of tomatoes, and one pound of cucumbers. In the same batch of orders, Yan Mou provided only one of the two of the lettuce (about one and a half pounds), two tomatoes (about one pound) and three greens (about one pound). Below, significantly increase sales prices. Not long ago, a rider in Shanghai made a hot search on Weibo in Shanghai. The reason was that he made 10,000 pieces a day, and the user rewarded more than 7,000. I see a lot of comments on the Internet to express their identification: Some say that this ""reward"" is a market -regulating behavior and an affirmation of consumers for the work of the courier brother; some say that sending express delivery is risky. I earn hard money and risk money. But what I want to say is that in the epidemic, don't you send it if you do not reward. Isn't this kind of reward be a disguised price? What is the difference between this pound of potatoes sold for 16.8 yuan and a green vegetable for 26 yuan? Make up prices in the law. The ""Price Law of the People's Republic of China"" has long been explicitly. Operators must not fabricate or spread the price increase information, make up prices, and promote the high rise in commodity prices. A few days ago, the Shanghai Market Supervision Bureau and the Municipal Development and Reform Commission also jointly issued the ""Guiding Opinions on the Prevention and Control of the Epidemic Prevention and Control"", which can be fined up to 3 million yuan in prices. It is not only the harm of the price of prices not only infringes the interests of consumers, violates business ethics, and allows the citizens to suffer it. More importantly, in the current critical period of common resistance to resistance, strengthening confidence and stability is an important guarantee. Therefore, it is urgent to severely crack down on prices. Market authorities should actively carry supervision responsibilities to allow ""getting epidemic and money"" to pay a heavy price; the general public should report complaints on illegal acts and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. Of course, governance to coaxing prices should also be combined, and the government should work hard to make a good supply to meet the daily life of the people. Li Qiang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said that it is necessary to make up the determination to open up the blocking point. The government and the market will work together to better play the role of protecting enterprises and platform enterprises. If we want to achieve the ultimate victory of resistance, we need to pay great efforts. We must not relax every link.

Zhu Feng, the chief coordinator of the head of the group, is a ""post -80s"" and works in a real estate company. ""The community has been closed, and the shortage of materials has become the most concerned about everyone. Occasionally, I helped the neighbor Tang Qiwen organize a group purchase of Sam together, and the feeling of being a head of the group."" But he found that because of the man's hand Insufficient and group purchase are mostly foods. Group purchase materials often have not been effectively eliminated, and there is a risk of virus transmission. Therefore, starting from April 8th, he and resident volunteers based on the relevant information founded by the parties, referring to the hospital, and the isolation point such as epidemic prevention standards to write the management system for group purchase, including the head of the regiment's management filing and the principle of material prevention prevention and epidemic prevention. Isolate the ""gesture"" with the three districts, and use the icon to show it clearly. The reporter saw that although it is a group purchase within the community, the professional level of the page is comparable to a professional platform.

The exquisite posters of the group purchase were released on the first day of the public account of the community, and more than 10,000 visits were obtained. Not only in the community, the influence also radiated to some surrounding areas, and some communities followed suit. ""Now the regulations on group purchase management have been upgraded from the initial version 1.0 to version 2.0. Only two links are required, and residents can find the content of the group purchase. The head of the volunteer group also introduced the supervisor system to make the group purchase more open and transparent. ""Zhu Feng said. The exclusive service group cares for special groups, and young people have stood up one after another, and the fields they pay attention to are not just young groups. ""Our family lacks green leafy vegetables. I don't know if the property can help buy something?"" Recently, the help from Aunt Wang, the old man from the community, has attracted everyone's attention. It turned out that only two elderly people at home would not buy them. In the same building, there was a young ""head"" who took the initiative to send food to the old couples and purchased them one by one. Volunteers of the neighborhood committee and other residents thought that similar needs for pregnant women, patients, and elderly people in the community can care for ""right -point"" and not allow a person to be helpless in the sealing community. As a result, a ""sending warm"" exclusive service WeChat group was established. After counting the number of relevant personnel, young volunteers such as the heads of the heads care for these key groups. ""Once young people start, the efficiency is 'lever'."" Xia Hao, a resident volunteer, lamented. Some people say that if they want a barrel of oil and a noodle, some people want 5 pounds of rice and noodles. They need to be reached by young volunteers. They will send them to the door immediately for the ""uncle"". There are chronic drugs for the elderly, and the residents and volunteers have implemented it to help buy medicine. In the community, the neighborhood mutual assistance documents are also updated in real time. Resident Evanians Ye Xia said, ""In special periods, everyone did not talk about it, and they bowed their heads to do some small things that they could and warm.

Don't worry, Allah come to help! In the past few days, many citizens sent out urgent help to the platform of this newspaper's ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" platform. ""Urgent worry"". As of 8:00 this morning, a total of 573 public welfare individuals, 6 public welfare institutions, and 20 public welfare companies have registered to join the ""War Epidemic · Gang Nong"" public welfare alliance. Patients with cerebral infarction are associated with medicine. Mr. Wang, who lives to the family and lives in the Gongkang Si Village, has to take blood circulation drugs such as blood Seyong for a long time. Due to the sealing of the community, on April 16, the drugs in his family had been used up. In the case of anxiety, Mr. Wang sent the ""emergency medicine"" platform for the ""Emergency Drug"" platform to the ""War Epidemic · Bangnong"" platform. The ""Public Welfare Alliance"" immediately acted and looked around. I first found a number of hospitals and online medical platforms, all feedback without goods. After inquiring from many parties, I finally found Hematomi at the Huangpu Branch of the Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai. On the morning of April 17th, the public welfare company was hungry and took over the delivery task and sent an anti -emergency car to the hospital. The driver Ni Changchun took 4 boxes of medicines from the pharmacist, and quickly sent it to Mr. Wang's community. ""It's really raining in time! With it, my heart is fixed at once."" Mr. Wang was relieved. Anti -epidemic personnel seemed to be a staff member of Pudong New Steel New Village Street Residents Committee on the Internet. For more than a month, Ms. Zhuang has adhered to the front line of resistance in the community to test, material procurement, and medical treatment for residents' nucleic acid testing, material procurement, and medical medicine. But many people don't know that she was a patient with lung cancer, and two years ago, she was found to have nodular diseases and took Chinese herbal herbal medicine to condition her body all year round. Earlier, Ms. Zhuang regularly went to a Chinese medicine department in Enshi, Hubei, and returned to Shanghai according to the prescribed prescription. But the sudden epidemic disrupted her treatment plan. Now she has broken the medicine for more than a month. Hubei medicine cannot be sent, and she has no time to go out to catch the medicine. Will repeat it again. ""Ms. Zhuang was very worried. The member of the Public Welfare Alliance Shanghai Tai Kuntang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital immediately said that he would ask the experienced Chinese medicine to consult online for Ms. Zhuang. Yesterday, Qian Xinlan, a well -known Chinese medicine expert in Tai Kuntang, carefully asked Ms. Zhuang's condition through the video and gave judgments and suggestions. This week, Tai Kuntang will send Chinese medicine to Ms. Zhuang as soon as possible. The bed of the old man asked the citizen Yu Grandma for help with the citizen Yu's grandma at the age of 93. He usually bed in bed and needs to use adult diaper. In the past, Ms. Yu was very convenient to buy through Taobao, but after the epidemic occurred, the courier was suspended, and the merchants could not ship, and the inventory at home was almost exhausted. She found a nearby pharmacy, and she didn't find a suitable product. In desperation, she sent it for help to ""Xinmin Gang Nong"". The ""Public Welfare Alliance"" volunteers buy through multiple channels after confirming the product specifications. On April 17th, I finally looked forward to the good news: Yangpu Store, Meizhou Da Pharmacy, just entered a group of corresponding adult diapers. After knowing the situation, the pharmacy manager specifically reserved a box for the elderly. The public welfare company ""SF Express"" sent the little brother to the pharmacy to pick up the goods, and then sent it to the women's community.

The personal albums of the family and word writer Liu Ming, and there are compilations of composers such as Pan Zhensheng, which contains many songs loved by children and children. With these lustered tape boxes, I saw the old people, and Liu Ming came in front of the teacher's cordial face. The teacher and I met with Liu Ming because I participated in the amateur creation group of the Xuhui District Cultural Museum that year. The very time was about to enter the end. The social environment was loose. Various group art activities were unearthed like Xiaochun seedlings. Teacher Liu is a full -time counselor of the Cultural Museum's creation group. He is responsible for poetry and music creation. He heard that he specializes in writing children's songs and will write lyrics. I have published a lot of works. I can't help but respect. After being familiar with each other, Teacher Liu sometimes wrote a satisfactory work and hummed in the office of the creation group in front of us. Whenever he was willing, his middle -aged man was like a big child, shaking his head and shaking his head, showing a little smile. He knew that I was trying to write children's poems and fairy tales. I told me that children's poems were the same as children's lyrics. They belonged to the twin brothers. The difference was that the lyrics paid attention to the sense of rhythm and the text was more simple. The author must have childlikeness, good at finding materials in daily life, picking pollen like bees, and processing and refining to write good works. Children and children are the flowers of the motherland. Excellent children's songs are indispensable spiritual food. You may wish to write some children's lyrics and I can compose. It's hot to say. With his enthusiasm and encouragement, in the future, I successively created dozens of children and children's lyrics, published in words such as ""Lyrics"" and ""Children's Songs"". In addition to the many songs such as ""Planting Sunflower in the kindergarten"" and ""Banner in the Heart"" composed by Teacher Liu, many of them were sung by other composers. Among them, ""A Star on the Mountain Road"" was awarded the National Children's Song Gold Award by CCTV, and won the 1995 ""Five One Engineering Awards"" in 1995. If I have achieved some results on children's lyrics, I have a careful counseling and help with Teacher Liu. Liu Ming will be a well -known musician Pan Zhensheng who created ""One Points"" and ""Miles"". He is a close friend in the creation of children's songs. They have all experienced the experience of music teaching in primary and secondary schools, and they are infatuated with children's song creation. Later, although a branch was far away in the Ningxia Literature Federation, one worked at the Shanghai Cultural Museum and Junior officials. For many years, they continued to work for the booming children's songs, and they were improving in art and fruitful. Teacher Liu wrote thousands of children and children's song works such as ""Bending Sickle"", ""Little Pig Sleeping"", ""A Group of Ducklings"", and many works have been published at home and abroad.

Space,Mom in monitoring,Space,"Since Meli had a camera for my mother's family last year, I can see her old man anytime, anywhere. This feels so good. Although it seems a bit unfair to my mother, because her privacy is gone, she doesn't seem to care. She understood that we were the mood of children, and just resolved that she had said that things were gone before, and worried that it was a heart disease that aunt took away (my sister and I seriously suspected that she could not find it.) Mom lives alone and has only one road with her sister's house. She loves freedom throughout her life and does not like to live with our juniors. She said to me that the elderly have different living habits and you have a different living habits. If I live together for a long time, I am afraid that there will be contradictions. If I have troubled with my two daughters, you are nothing to do. It's hard to do if it's not good. She has her hidden concerns. The location of the camera is facing the living room. By the way, you can see the door of the kitchen and toilet, and the figure of people's movement inside. There are only two rooms. But don't I want to see these? When did the mother get up, when to eat, and when to turn off the lights to sleep. Did she go out? Auntie helped her make a few dishes today. Even several times, I heard which drama in Peking opera, which drama chasing in the TV opera, or which singer sang. I think although my mother's usual entertainment life is slightly monotonous by the TV, the TV is more effective than her daughter, because her daughter cannot accompany her from time to time. Seeing the mother's feeling in the monitoring, maybe we should have pretended to have one long ago. For example, she often sat on the sofa and watched TV. When she looked at the crooked head and fell asleep, I would shout to the camera: ""Mom, don't get cold, cover a blanket."" My mother heard that I was calling her to call her I woke up, and I wanted to justify it, and did not fall asleep without falling asleep. Sometimes, she was busy watching her walking around, and the movement was obviously slower than before, so she shouted a few ""Mom"". She went to the camera, as if she saw me in it, surprised, and asked with a smile, this time was my big girl? There is a slightly enlarged mother in the camera, like a happy comedy, I can see me laughed, and I laughed and laughed. There are many times, because my mother and I are happy. I feel more and more, although there is no dad to shout, but my mother can see at any time, but shouting, for me, it is one of the happiest and happy things in the world. Life cannot always be sweet. From the pressure of the body, the pressure of life in the big city, and the repeated epidemic will make my soul sometimes disturbed and emotional lower. At this time, I turned on the camera. As long as I saw my mother's figure, my heart could calm down immediately. Maybe everyone lives with two souls, one is deadly, and the other is hot. These two souls have been fighting for each other, but they have been competing, but they all need an exit. Some people say that he moved to exercise as soon as he came up, and some said that she would buy and buy, and some chose to eat sweets. What about me, looking at my mother, in other words, the end of the universe is the mother in monitoring. Anyway, once the negative emotions have a place to go, the desperate soul escapes, and the steaming soul will come to hug you.

Space ,From Marriage Mom. ,,"In the past few days, Wu Nanyao, ""Ginger who has been a soldier"" publishes 40 or fifty similar friends circles every day to connect various resources and needs. Behind this is the countless WeChat and dozens of or hundreds of calls every day. Jiang Hongyun, a transfer officer, from the army to the local area, the nickname of ""Jiang Leifeng"" called all the way. The epidemic in Shanghai was tight, and he was named after he was named but did not have the opportunity to become a ""big white"". He could not leave home every day. This old party member with 37 years of party age was anxious and borrowed from the experience of previous databases to single men and women. The ""circle of friends"" relying on her own mobile phone to make ""big white on the fingertips"" and the red maid who resists. He joined the army in 1980, transferred to Shanghai in 2012, transferred several positions, and worked in the municipal health system for more than 9 years. Jiang Hongyun's WeChat name and the young officer's document in his youth showed his background color: ""Ginger of being a soldier."" Those who have experienced the melting furnace of the army will always surpass their interests and mission, with a upright personality, and the heart of the heart. On March 24, the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee issued a letter to the members of the city. Ginger quickly installed the ""Pioneer Shanghai"" applet and completed the ""dual report"". The ""front line"" ginger was in a hurry. On March 31, Jiang received a WeChat of Liao Yixiang, an old comrade in Wuhan in Wuhan: Jiang's political commissar, Shanghai's epidemic is very heavy. Our company wants to donate 50,000 N95 masks to express a little bit of intention to return to Shanghai Aid Epiderium. Can you help me contact the receiving unit? OK! Ginger quickly released this information in the circle of friends. In less than a minute, Professor Fu Youth, retired veteran and veteran party member of the Navy 905 Hospital replied: The Municipal Public Health Center urgently needed to resist supplies. Ginger immediately notified Wuhan to arrange logistics companies to ship, and they arrived at the Municipal Public Health Center the next day. ""Good things in the end, even the freight is paid by President Liao."" The speed matching was successful, and ginger came out. During the outbreak of Wuhan in 2020, as the general branch and webmaster of the Shanghai Health and Health Commission's foreign supplier supply station, when Shanghai was also very tight, ginger took the team and the workload turned over. As soon as four, the task that was almost impossible to complete was completed to ensure the protection of all foreign medical teams during the epidemic. ""Just believe in Shanghai people, I believe you, the old soldier"" is the evaluation of ginger in the circle. Material deployment is the strength of ginger, which is not enough to go home, but the news can be released through the mobile phone. ""Shanghai's epidemic conditions are serious, and epidemic prevention materials such as masks and protective clothing are urgently needed. If your company wants to contribute love, I am willing to match!"" Sentences, quickly sent to business bresses across the country. In less than 10 hours, the donation plan of more than ten companies flew from the motherland. Guangzhou Shuangyi Group, Hangzhou Licheng Company, Panjia Holding Group, Yantai Family Pharmaceutical Company, Dalian latex company, Guilin Hengbao Company, Shandong Hainuo Group, Shanghai Yingjing Company, Shanghai Wanchuan Medical Device Company, Shanghai name Bang Company ... the list is getting longer and longer. Suddenly, a Vietnamese phone came in from the United States. It seems that the name is Chen Liming. He is the wife of the late famous film actor Yang Zaihuan, and is also a enthusiastic and charity veteran and old party member. She saw Jiang's fundraising activities from WeChat, and took the initiative to say that she would donate to the Shanghai Respects of Shanghai. She asked Beijing colleagues to check the company's inventory, 450 N95 masks, more than 200 sets of protective clothing, other masks and hand -toilet Materials are all sent to Shanghai with express delivery. Although the old friend Wang Weibin is not a party member, in the eyes of Jiang, he is a Communist Party member. He very enthusiasticly contacted relevant departments such as civic affairs, Chongming District, Putuo District, and Minhang District as units to receive donations. He was worried that the transportation of materials for the donation was prone to problems, and he took the initiative to provide the mobile phone number of the leaders of the Municipal Traffic Police Corps. Zhang Liqiang, the former director of the Shanghai Institute of Health Education, was an old party member. After retirement, he has been enthusiastic about engaging in public welfare activities. He learned that Jiang was busy donating anti -epidemic supplies and took the initiative to store some materials to store some materials at the Hu Jinhua Health Education Promotion Center to solve the problem of material turnover venues. Mr. Hu Jinhua, a well -known health education expert, old predecessor, and old party member, also gives great support for the public welfare actions launched by ginger. The fundraising, just a highlight of ""big white on the fingertips"". There are also many problems that have never encountered emergency solution problems that have never encountered the difficulties of ginger. There is a Tibetan class at Jinyuan Senior High School, and the supplies of living materials must be disconnected. The Director of the Gansu Provincial Office of Shanghai and the Communist Party member Kong Lingcheng learned this urgent situation from Bao Yu, Putuo District Education Bureau. : ""Ginger, you have a lot of magical powers, hurry up and help, 100,000 are in a hurry!"" Open a search engine like a computer. With, find President Pei, she has the channel for food and living materials! Docking processing, followed two hours later and questioned: Did the supplies be sent to the school? arrive! We found a unit with a passage of logistics, which is absolutely reliable! There is no trivial matter for people's livelihood. Jiang Jiang said that the follow -up and effectiveness must be implemented, and the style must be too solid at the critical moment. The retired old party member Lao Dai is the chief of the financial section of the ginger unit. In the past two days, he has been a ""big white"" at home. Pudong's epidemic is very heavy, and the epidemic prevention supplies are consumed very large. She watched the ""big white suit"" with light. She sent a WeChat: Secretary Jiang, can he donate a little protective service to our community? Coincidentally, Zheng Lingang, the boss of Suzhou Jialeway Company, went to the phone and commissioned Jiang to purchase a group of protective clothing to donate to the most needed place in Shanghai! He said: ""I am an old party member. At the critical moment, I have to make a force!"" Watching this pair is going to be, Dai Ke calls again: they just arrived in a batch of protective clothing, troubled Secretary Jiang will donate it to donate it. Protective clothing, donate to the most needed place! Old friend Xu Qinming was awarded the honorary title of Outstanding Volunteer in Shanghai. Soon, he sent these protective clothing to Pudong Traffic Police Detachment! Jiang Jiang said that although people are sealed at home, blood is still hot! In just a few days, the anti -epidemic -resistant matchmaker was paired. There are also many things that need to be purchased: 50,000 barrels of instant noodles; office equipment such as computer, printers and other office equipment of Hubei Aid Hospital Hospital; more than 500 elderly diapers of a nursing home ... Nothing is fine, and there are some kinds of various kinds of All kinds of busy gangs: Friend Wang's mother's eyes were accidentally splashed by disinfectant, and Tan Haibo, an ophthalmologist, helped solve it. A company needs to find a large truck and driver; the PLA has customized chips to Wuxi in a certain part of the PLA; 400,000 sets of protection purchased by a certain district obeyed to Shanghai; and so on. All kinds of things that are usually easy to deal with now are very difficult. No matter how difficult it is, you have to find a way! Jiang Jiang said that ""Jiang Leifeng"" is not a single person alone, but a loose combat collective of a group of public welfare volunteers in Shanghai and even China. Their feelings are humble and restrained, and their actions are rigorous and fast. They practice the vows of the year: ""If there is a war, call back.""

One day, he followed his daughter to the supermarket and saw a large cabbage on the shelves at a price of $ 19.80. He has a hard work, which is equivalent to RMB 100. I couldn't help whispering: ""So expensive?"" The daughter heard only one sentence: ""Just eat it."" After three days, I went to the supermarket. This Chinese cabbage was still at $ 13.80. Han Feng glanced at it and paid attention to it. After three days, I went again, this Chinese cabbage was only $ 3. Han Feng said to her daughter, ""Three times, see three different prices."" The daughter asked him, ""What do you mean?"" Han Feng was ready to take a shot. Unexpectedly, the daughter took him. Han Feng looked at her daughter with wide eyes. The daughter said, ""I don't want you to buy this dish, can you?"" He asked, ""Why?"" The daughter asked him: ""How many people are you waiting for this cabbage to reduce the price?"" Han Feng did not respond for a while Essence The daughter continues: ""This is cheap, don't take it up!"" Han Feng was counted by his daughter, a little annoyed in his heart, and his face was a bit embarrassing. My daughter relieved: ""Dad, we are not a person without money. This Chinese cabbage should be given to those who need it more."" After all, it is a cultural and cultivated person. very happy. After returning, Han Feng proudly told the story in Dongyu Boxing Club, Pudong Xinchang Ancient Town. I heard it, I couldn't count it, ""seeing the wisdom and thinking together"", I had to practice it. On March 22, the community suddenly closed. There is a volunteer girl in the kitchen window. The community is going to be closed, and you want to buy something. I went out of the community immediately and bought a little vegetable home opposite. The next day, the nearby lawyer friend Zhao Yuesheng insisted on sending things over. He couldn't hold it enthusiastic. I opened a list. He bought two big bags and sent it to the entrance of the community. , I can only go downstairs to get it. This lawyer friend is an enthusiastic person. In addition to his job, he also serves as the chairman of the Mutual Welfare Foundation. On Thursday, March 31, before Puxi, he called to send things over again. I repeatedly refused, no. He said that his wife had already asked ""Bai Bai"" at the door of my community in advance, and said that he could bring it in. This building is a serious area of the epidemic. Many people are infected. The express materials downstairs are piled up. No one dares to come up. Eight people in the neighborhood committee want to serve thousands of people in the community and two communities next to them. A knight at Room 801 upstairs shot. He put on a protective suit, bravely took the elevator downstairs, and sent the courier items stacked at the gate of Building 4 to each household. On the high -rise building on the 18th floor, a person ran up and down. Someone in the neighborhood committee shot his video. The shirt behind was soaked. Everyone praised him. Some people reminded him to go home to take a bath for disinfection. After a while, Room 1206 said in the group and said: There is a pack of things at the door, which is from Room 206. I knew it was wrong. I went back and said: I can't go out, let alone go to the stairs, let's talk about it. Since then, I never said again. The next day, there were always people calling for help to find things, and I kept silent. Because, these things are less than 200 yuan, but asking an extremely tired volunteer to hold it, it is still a bit of weight. Besides, there are more things, not a bag of me! I can't bear to trouble others. Two days, I saw two information in the group, which was very moved. One to say: I have a sense of guilt now. The second says: I want to pick things with a little bit, and I can't get up too heavy. This is a dependent thinking, thinking for others. Think of the story of a large cabbage that Mr. Han Feng tells. I have been blocked for 12 days to write new things and Australian stories above. I did n’t understand, I did n’t encounter it. Now I know that the disasters of human beings in the book before seeing war and plague were ranked together. There is also a feeling. As far as this building is concerned, some people are standing in their own difficulties and needs to interpret the sealing notice of the community and the building. Property, they have to face the residents of the three buildings of the entire community, and they have the risk and facts of being infected and infected. There are also difficulties. When recruiting volunteers in the building, the young man in Room 202 first registered response, and then many people stood out in the group almost in the group, and carefully looked at the registration list. There was two couples. It turned out that there were so many brave volunteers in this building.

Just concentrate on listening to music and don't cry. When he was four or five years old, he had no teacher. As long as he saw and heard the second sister and three sisters playing piano practice music, he could find a small bench alone, step on it to climb on the piano stool, and himself.

At that time, the Conomedas Quartet, which was composed of four professors of Moscow Conservatory of Music, recorded it at the Soviet National Broadcasting Station. What a glory for an international student! In 1958, Zu Qiang graduated with his excellent results and returned to teach at the Beijing Central Conservatory of Music. He did not live up to the cultivation of the party and the country. For more than sixty years, no matter whether he has been in teaching or a leader position, or the busy social activities, he has not relaxed the music teaching of music talents and cultivated a large number of international musicians. He abandoned the senior official Hou Lu and rushed to the cause of music and culture. He knows the world's contributions to the music culture. For example, the musicians of the ballet drama ""Fish Beauty"" and ""Red Lady Army"" are well -known; Combined with the technique of Western Symphony to create a large number of works, such as the string ensemble ""Erquan Yueyue"", the pipa concerto ""Grassland Heroes"", and ""Spring River Flower Moon Night"", ""Listening to Songsong Night"" """" Liang Xiao ""and so on.

In 2007, the National Grand Theater was completed, and he was also hired as the director of the National Grand Theater Art Committee, which continued to contribute to the prosperity of the national music culture and art cause. Sixth Brother Zuqiang was very concerned about our brothers and sisters. At the end of 1948, he took me and Xiaobai to ""liberate"" to Shanghai and other. After the liberation in 1949, he also took me to the city's North Middle School to sign up for high school. In 1964, he was responsible for the overall design of the ballet ""Red Lady Army"" music.

In 1982, in 1982, to rectify the school style, strengthen campus culture construction, and launched the activity of ""recalling school history, writing school songs"" activities. , I summarized everyone's opinions, wrote the first draft, and asked Liu Brother to compose.

He wrote to me, and suggested that the author named ""Lu Chang"". He walked Lu, and I was named Chang. Don't use the real name. However, the school committee couldn't understand it, but still used the real name. Through the education of school history and school songs, the students of our school have been greatly encouraged.

Space,Love without roots,Space,"Luo Yuming Qin Keqing's brother Qin Zhong, and Jia Baoyu is a pair of young friends. The fifteenth and sixteen times of ""Dream of Red Mansions"", mixed with other contents, wrote Qin Zhong's love and death -a sad and meditating story. At the beginning, Wang Xifeng helped Jia Zhen to operate Qin Keqing's funeral instrument, and lived in Shuiyueyue on the day of the big day. In the evening, the aunt of the net deficiency came over to pull a transaction with Sister Feng, and Baoyu and Qin Zhong, who came with Sister Feng, played in the Buddhist temple. After a while, Xiao Ni was smart, and Baoyu laughed and said, ""Can you come."" Qin Zhong said, ""What do you do?"" It sounds like the tone of the two people is different. Baoyu called Xiao Ni ""in power"" and had a good tone; Qin Zhong called her ""that thing"", as if she had nothing to do with herself, and was a bit contempt. But he is a guilty conscience and concealed himself. Baoyu laughed at him when he pretended to be fine: ""Don't get ghosts! In the old lady's house that day, there is no one, what do you do with him? The storyline that happened before. The smart child walked with Master in Rongfu since he was a child. She gradually grew up. The so -called love sinus opened, and when she saw Qin Zhongjun's elegant and elegant, she liked it; although smart is a nun, she looks beautiful and charming. Qin Zhong also loves her very much. Although the two were not very good, they had a good intention and understood in their hearts. Therefore, Baoyu and Qin Zhong played in the Buddhist temple. Smart running over is not unintentional. Baoyu revealed the truth, and then blackmailed: ""Is there any or not, you just told him to pour a bowl of tea for me, so you can do it."" Why do you want to say a bowl of tea? Baoyu also explained: ""I told him to fall down, and it was not as good as you called him."" There is no affectionate tea, and it is rare in the people with affection. It's not tea, but affection; the aunt of the nun is not affectionate to me, so I will stick to you and borrow it. Smart poured tea. Qin Zhong said with a smile: ""Give me."" Baoyu also called: ""Give me."" Smart Er pouted and laughed: ""A bowl of tea is also fighting, is there a honey in my hand!"" Boys are fighting for diligence, a happy response, and talking between a girl's unique innocence and pride. Between boys and girls, if there are some emotions, if there is nothing, it seems that it is soft, it is very soft, it is beautiful, and it is also charming. Baoyu was satisfied with the bowl of tea, but Qin Zhong wanted more. When there was no one in the dark, he went to the back room to look for smart children, and begged her to ""good sister"", and wanted to be good with smart children. Smart said: ""What are you going to do, unless I am out of this pit, it is better to leave these people."" This means that she is also willing to be together. But she had to escape from this pit. Only by leaving these people can she find a home! Is it possible to be a nun forever and sneak with you? The novel does not explain the family's family. But we can know from the storyline: she has no home in Beijing, and there is no place to be able to vote. She may be an orphan, maybe the poor can not live, and give it to the old nun as an apprentice and a commissioner. Anyway, it is not her wish to be a nun. But she called Shui Yuezhang's place as ""pits"". In addition to yearning for worldly life, her master, the old and sly clenched old nun, the feeling of her giant, was also very bad to her feelings. This can be imagined. If you want me, you take me away. This is the wish of intelligence. How did Qin Zhong answer? He said, ""This is also easy, but‘ far water can not be neat thirst ’.” He was unwilling to wait, and said with a bite, the room was dark, and the smart child was hugged on the cymbal. At this time, Baoyu did not know how to break in and scattered a pair of wild puppets. Smart children are still young, maybe Baoyu feels that it is not appropriate. At that time, Qin Zhong was about thirteen years old, and his intelligence was smaller. They love each other is a kind of natural feelings for young people. They are ignorant, panic, and have no reliable foundation, and there is no exact plan; behind this, more importantly, they have not controlled their own destiny. Qin Zhong is an official child. How can his father allow him to be with a nun? It is almost difficult for him to rescue the intelligence pit. But he said, ""It's easy."" This is obviously to say a word in order to greet the happiness in front of me. Although it is not deceived, there is really no serious thinking. When young people love each other, not only lacks restraint and calculations, it is also vague about the understanding of danger. Xiao Ni Aunt Smart is an infatuated and bold girl. After Qin Zhong left Shuiyueyu and returned to Beijing, she thought about it day and night, and finally disregarded everything and ran out of the city. Found. This is okay! From the perspective of the old man, this is simply ridiculous and unpredictable. In a furious, he not only drove away his intelligence, but also hit Qin Zhong's pain. These are all of them. Qin Ye was a child in his old age. At this time, he was in his 70s. He was old and weak, and he was anxious and anxious. The old illness recurred. After three or five days, he died. Qin Zhong was weak, and he had a pain with illness, and his body was even worse. His personality was also weak. He saw his father who was alive and died for his fault. He regretted himself and blamed himself. The condition worsened every day and finally came to an end. On this day Baoyu rushed to Qin Mansion when he heard the news, Qin Zhong had fainted several times. Qin Keqing and Qin Ye have died first. There are only a few alienated relatives in the Qin family who are taking care of him. They have carried Qin Zhong from the cymbal on a board bed to clean up the funeral. Unexpectedly, Qin Zhong had only a breath, and when he heard Baoyu's cry, he woke up again. The novel was written in Qin Zhong before his death, and it was bitter to read. The first is that smart children have no whereabouts. In order to pursue the happiness of the world, this beautiful and bold nun escaped from the ""pit"" she said. The world is vast, and she is young and ignorant. What kind of pits are waiting for her? This made Qin Zhong think of death. The second is the three or four thousand silver of the father left by his father. Bai Xianyong's book believes that Qin Zhong is about to die, and it is unreasonable to remember those silver. Mr. Bai said that ""Dream of Red Mansions"" is the opposite of Zhang Ailing everywhere, and many of his views are strange. Qin Ye is a poor official. Three or four thousand silver is the entire property of this family. I do n’t know how to reduce the province to save it. But the people of the Qin family died, and this money could only be left to the farm relatives who had nothing to do with it. The third is regretting a lifetime. At that time, Baoyu asked him: ""What are the words left two sentences."" Qin Zhong said: ""There is no other word. In the past, you and I knew that he was more than the world, and I only learned about it today. That's right. ""After speaking, I left people. How to understand Qin Zhong's passage, this end of this life entrustment? He and Baoyu are good friends; they both have a rebellious spirit and look down on the vulgar people who pursue fame and fortune; and they all think that their knowledge is higher than the world. However, their rebellion is blind, without a real social foundation, and on the road of rebellion, they don't even have basic survivability. The love between the teenagers between Qin Zhong and Smart is originally beautiful, but it cannot be visible to society, so it cannot be seen to the parents. As a result, he killed intelligence, himself, and killed his old father! Before he died, he warned Baoyu with his own tragedy: We had no power on the road of rebellion. Qin Zhong's fate is also the epitome of Baoyu's fate. His story and his regrets are deep in ""Dream of Red Mansions"".",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-20/7.htm,4/20/22,No. 7 Edition: Nights Cup,,True

Space,"""After the 95th"" I have become a good helper for the old people of the cabin",Space,"I am a ""post -95"" employee of the Shanghai Huai Opera Troupe. At 3 am on April 7, I received a call from the Center for Disease Control. Instant, get on, enter the cabin ... a series of steps caught me off guard. When I recorded my personal information, the medical staff asked me if I could help the aunt next door. She was a migrant worker who came to Shanghai and almost did not know the text on the detection software. Each nucleic acid detection was a companion to complete the registration. ""This is the whole, what's the word ..."" Aunt kept asking ""Dabai"". I readily agreed and used my mobile phone to help the aunt's entry information. The aunt thanked her. Since I have the first ""appreciating my audience"", my ""square cabin life"" seems to have opened the door of the new world. I have encountered the old Grandpa who only used the elderly machine, the mother of the two children, and the mother of the two children. The minority compatriots who only have a little Mandarin ... After a round of entry, the medical staff asked with a smile and asked me if I should be the ""layer"" on this layer. ""Of course there is no problem!"" In this way, I, an ordinary ""post -95s"", took up the logistics support work on the floor: knocking from house to the door while eating; the ""neighbors"" who could not operate mobile phones when doing nucleic acids solved the trouble. ; Recording, feedback, follow -up, and implementing the materials needed by the people around you ... In the days of the square hospital, I have a few positions to transform the technical maintenance workers, civil mediators, food issuers, psychological counselors; solve the solution The problem of blocking the sewer, the disappearance of the mobile phone signal, helping the elderly to dispatch anxiety, and telling the roommates with cold jokes to relieve uneasiness. The busy and fulfilling life completely calmed down my bad emotions. Whenever I received the thanks of the ""neighbors"", I felt that I was worthy of relying on people. These happiness was a ordinary person in ordinary people living in ordinary people. Never before. This is a very complicated emotion, mixed with movement, sympathy, and intertwined with a sense of accomplishment, honor, and pride, making me truly happy. One afternoon, a granddaughter's rushing greeting greeted me back to reality from a nap. Grandma was excited and frustrated repeatedly that the mobile phone was broken, and she couldn't talk to her son anymore. I took the mobile phone and disposable gloves from Grandma, and she repeatedly explained that the gloves were borrowed next door. It was very clean. The phone had just been poisoned. I studied my phone for a long time. To be honest, the moment I took the phone, I had no confidence to repair it, but Grandma was full of confidence in me. When I fixed my phone, when I returned to Zhao, the grandmother gave me a thumbs up: ""Oh, our little beauty is really a stick! I will repair everything!"" Later, the grandma said my ""glorious deeds"", After dinner, the whole floor knew that I restored a ""brick"" into a mobile phone! I was embarrassed to respond to the kindness of everyone's goodwill, returned to the room, and ate the cookies that the grandma stuffed to me when I was leaving. It was not big, very sweet ... In this way, the life of the square cabin continued smoothly and in an orderly manner. Go down. That night, I do n’t know which community to unblock the cheers.

Space,Why is this foreigner who is a volunteer?,"""I have benefited from my work in China, and now I want to give back to this country""","""Hello, this is your entry and exit certificate. One household is limited to one person once a day. Thank you for your cooperation."" Recently, in Dongming Huayuan Community, Fangsong Street, Songjiang District, Songjiang District, which is classified as a prevention area, many residents encountered a foreign country. Volunteers come to the door to preach control measures. He wore a volunteer vest and spoke a less standard Mandarin. This is the Dutch person in China for 30 years in China Jacob von Bestfield. He also has Chinese name -Luo Jiangqiang, and him Community volunteers who resist the diseases on the shoulder like to call him ""Lao Luo"". The following is the self -report of Lao Luo -after Puxi sealing control on April 1, I decided to prevent and control volunteers. A enthusiastic Communist Party member quickly got the application form. After coordinating, I was appointed foreign volunteers responsible for translation services, and then got the isolation clothes, gloves, masks, face screens, and volunteers vest. There are more than 2,500 residents I live in. On the first day and fourth day of the sealing control, I participated in maintaining the sampling order of nucleic acid and guided residents to maintain a safe distance. More often, I participated in the registration of the personnel of the building to ensure that the residents of specific buildings went downstairs for sampling. Everyone uses social media extensively. The leader of the building will remind related matters through the WeChat group. During the sealing period, Shanghai provided basic living materials for each residents for free. Thousands of food parcels were transported from trucks from all over China. The distribution of these materials was definitely a huge challenge for community workers. In Dongming Huayuan Community, volunteers have not stopped at all times. For the infant milk powder, medicines and other items purchased by residents, we will use various transportation tools including baggage cars, electric bicycles, and send them to the corresponding building. The clearing of garbage here forms a safe and effective process. The neighborhood committee requires that each residents will be divided into dry and humid waste bags at the door at 7 am to 8 am. I and other volunteers and I worn their disposable isolation clothes, wear gloves and masks, compact the garbage box, send it to the designated garbage point, and then collected by the Sanitation Department of Songjiang District. After completion, the isolation clothes, gloves and masks worn by volunteers are treated as medical waste. Of course, the key to curbing viruses such as Omiko strains, the key is to minimize contact between people, but this is difficult, because humans themselves like to live in groups. Therefore, volunteers and I need to patrol at night in the community to prevent residents from going out in violation of regulations, but actual observations have found that there are very few situations. Maybe someone would ask, what caused foreigners like me to come out as volunteers? My opinion is a natural sense of responsibility for most foreigners. I realize that virus transmission may be paralyzed with basic public services and endangers the lives of more people. Some of the foreign friends in China believe that they are willing to stay in China and live well in China. We benefit from China's work, hoping to participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic and give back to this country. Moreover, volunteer services can also truly understand locals, such as the way they solve problems and how to deal with interpersonal relationships. In my community, most young volunteers are Communists. From them, I can feel the spirit of the Long March -not afraid of any difficulties, and unite closely.

There are diseases such as hyperuricemia, chronic renal dysfunction, and drugs such as Kangchen uremia clear particles (sugar -free) for a long time. Although the community is closed, although volunteers have contacted many parties, they have not been equipped with drugs that the elderly needed. Mr. Wang and his wife have broken the drug for many days, and their physical condition has deteriorated. The Public Welfare Alliance Volunteer immediately took the help of the two elderly people. After contacting the volunteers of the community, he learned that the old man's daughter had been equipped with ""life -saving medicine"". But how does her daughter live in Puxi, how to deliver the drugs has become a problem. The public welfare alliance issued a ""urgent order"", hoping that volunteers can help send medicine. A few minutes later, Dai Tao, a public welfare person, took the initiative to ""raise his hand"".

Space,Lie Ghost to eat tofu,Space,"After Chen Shixu lived in Guangzhou, I heard a sentence describing a person's savvy saying: ""Do you uh ghost tofu?"" Among them, ""uh"" is ""cheating""; : ""Do you lie to ghosts to eat tofu?"" The source of this sentence is a folklore: a long time ago, there was a scholar, super smart, and even ghosts could cheat. One night, a villain arrived in his house and wanted to eat him. He said, ""You want to eat me? The door is too (no problem), but I have a cold day, the flesh is sour and smelly, and it is good to eat. The meat is much more fresh. ""Ghost Xin thought it was true. The scholar ran away with ghosts eating tofu. This story reminds me of an old colleague from his hometown. He has a good mind, fast response, talks and rushing, and walks. Later, he became a leader and made a report without a manuscript. Knowing the world, the decision of killing and killing, he couldn't hide anything, and no one could confuse him. Many years have passed. Last year, I returned to my hometown because of family affairs. When I met the son of this old colleague, I told me very sadly that his father went into the demon! Most of the salary of salary every month to various ""health care companies"", ""health seminars"" and ""lectures on life and technology"", and replace it back to Linlin can detoxify, beauty, anti -cancer, anti -aging, prevent all diseases, and longevity. Bowl pans, clothing, bedding, solid liquid ... large bags and small bags, long boxes and short boxes, piled up the home without pouring. He was busy living in and out of the place every day, concentrated on his will, and he was not tired of this. As a result, his son had to ""respect"" his ""salesman"" and ""invite"" his ""new acquaintance"" from time to time to come to the door from time to time. But noisy, noisy, scolding, and beating, everything was not available, and it was still the same. There are often reports of criminals on the media. Some deception methods are not clever, but it is so easy to be fooled. The phenomenon of ""deception"" is wandering in cities, villages, enterprises, schools, and even many unexpected places. Scholars and experts have done in -depth research on this aspects of sociology, psychology, biology, legal science, and medicine. The publicity of various media such as television is vigilant, self -protection, and absolutely not allowed criminals to be organic, and so on. These are naturally not effective, but it is still difficult to prevent deception. Especially attention is the elderly group. Compared with other people, they seem to be more and more likely to be deceived. The reason for the simple summary is that the degree of trust increases with age, the cognitive power is declining with age; lack of care for love , Lack of protection and reminders of children and loved ones, and so on. In addition, fraud, the deception is similar. Faced with cunning liar, they often make the following mistakes: 1. Self -deceive. Although doubtful, facing the temptation of interests, trying to persuade yourself, how to see the other person is not like a liar; second, luck. Maybe I feel that the other party has a trick, but there are somewhat handles in their hands, such as deposit and hostages, but they have won the scammers' double reeds and serial bureau; ""Three people become tigers"", listening to the wind is rain; 4. I think it is a big cheap, but it is the liar's bait; 5. I think celebrities and authority must be better than themselves; 6. ""Compatriots"", ""colleagues"", ""fellow villagers"" and ""acquaintances"" are not guarded; seven, always feel that at least one percent of hopes, but not knowing one of the scammers one by one percent; 8. Knowing that there is no free lunch in the world, But I still can't stop accepting hints. However, all of the above are not my old colleague. In the year of 生, he was still angry, his thinking was clear, and his actions were agile. Although his wife has already been sick, his children are successful, family harmony, take care of him, and respect him. His son talked to me for a long time that day, and he was puzzled. I pondered for a long time and said: There is only one reason, that is, his old man has a smooth and rainy life, and has almost no setbacks, forming absolute self -confidence, and he will never make mistakes. He can deceive the ghosts to eat tofu. Essence Such self -confidence is actually a cognitive defect, a kind of irreparable stupidity. The so -called stupidity is just unreasonable, regardless of the blue and red soap -based on politeness, I did not say this sentence. Those who can cheat ghosts can only be legendary, and in reality, they do not exist in reality. In this sense, the biggest scammers are actually in their own hearts.

Space,I want Li Bai to see ...,Space,"Although Zhu Yuan's dance drama ""Never Passing the Rods"" is known as the phenomenon -level dance drama ""The Radio Wave"" has performed more than 400 games. Although the poster of Wang Jiajun, who played Li Xia in the play, was covered with the streets and alleys, wearing masks and protective clothing He was not recognized by a dance fan until three days later. It was not accurate to say that in fact, the residents saw the names written behind him, so they paid attention to the half -faced face, which was confirmed. Asked if he would have an idol baggage, Wang Jiajun said with a smile: ""I can't be busy, what burdens are not burdensome. Daily use of medicines, stare at nucleic acids, and send vegetables. This time The stage looks beautiful and fresh, but in fact, the life of the dancer is very simple. Usually two o'clock, either home or dance group rehearsal hall. Because of the hot performance and tour of the ""radio waves"", Wang Jiajun for two or three years in a row, and it took only a few months to stay in Shanghai. Most of the time, his eyes opened and he had to be stunned for a while before he could think of which city in. In order to get close to the dance group, his parents bought a small house for his old district on Shuicheng Road. With this round of epidemic prevention and control, he has been isolated in this community for more than half a month. ""Really, I have lived here for so many years, and the neighbors who have known each other have not been these half a month."" On April 1st, Shanghai Puxi Sea Control, on March 31, Wang Jiajun signed up for community volunteers. ""We Most of the communities in this community are the husband's house on the sixth floor. The community is very aging. Many of them are grandparents and grandma who have come to a house before. They were inconvenient to go up and down. . We should naturally stand up for the few young people and provide some help. ""Volunteers have complicated work. Wang Jiajun is not afraid of suffering or tired, so he is afraid of getting the elderly:"" A large part of the elderly in residents will not be too much. With a smartphone, it will not be as sensitive as young people's mobile phone information, so they shouted from holding a big horn to knocking from house to house, and then explained and communicated with many elderly people who do not want to go down. Sort out and let the elderly stand for a long time. ""Fortunately, after a day or two"" exercises "", the detection of nucleic acid was carried out in an orderly manner. To this day, Wang Jiajun has been serving in the community for more than ten days, and almost all volunteer positions have been taken. Whether you go to the hospital to distribute the medicine or ""snap up"" the pharmacy; whether it is escorting the last 200 meters of transportation, or to throw garbage in the controlling building, Wang Jiajun said that the most tiring position is the position of auxiliary nucleic acid detection. ""Help nucleic acid detection, usually go to the job to prepare for the job one hour before the medical care. Usually the detection starts at 7 am. Then we will start to set up a shed and set the table to prepare disinfection and detection sticks. Tags for the tube stickers, and also ensure that the code sweepper can operate normally. Basically, it takes six or seven hours in one stop. ""And originally thought, helping volunteers can move the body of the home home. It disappeared after putting on a protective clothing, wearing a mask and a protective mask. The protective clothing is particularly stuffy. Wearing not only is restrained by hands and feet, it is difficult to breathe for a long time, let alone stretch your body. The physical labor such as carrying rice and moving vegetable bags does not exercise muscles, because the way of exerting force is different. So usually watching hard work for a day, he must massage his muscles first, then switch his body to the dance channel, and re -training and basic dance training. Of course, such a valuable experience also allowed the preparatory party member Wang Jiajun to gain an unprecedented life experience. In his own words: ""This time, it is really integrated into the masses and feels it down to the earth. The work of Moon Volunteer gave him a deeper understanding of the community and neighbors. ""Urgent others and want others to think"" also made him fall into the human fireworks. ""I think this (paragraph experience) will be In the future, a valuable wealth will be closer to the life itself whether it is a story in dance or shaping the role on the stage. """" Radio waves ""have performed hundreds of games, and Wang Jiajun performed on the stage countless times. For the prototype, he said in an interview: ""Every time he plays, he will feel that he is closer to Li Bai, and he can understand his choice and sacrifice better."" From time to time, he remembered the hero he played over and over again. ""Because of their dedication, we don't have to face such a cruel struggle, but we also want them to see that today we can also work together Watch the help.

Space ,The correct way to open the home environment ,,"Disinfection in time and effectively is an important part of the epidemic prevention and control. Recently, Shanghai is carrying out environmental cleaning and disinfecting operations in public areas. For park green spaces, roads, sidewalks, etc., relevant departments and districts have continued to carry out disinfecting operations. It has now eliminated 6,444 green land and cleared 1308 blind spots. In addition to the cleaning and disinfecting of the environment in the public areas, doing a good job of cleaning work and proper sterilization and disinfection have also become a compulsory course for many friends to live in epidemic prevention. So, how to correctly disinfect home and environment? What disinfection methods are wrong? Environmental improvement work, the Office of the Municipal Patriotic Health Sports Committee, the Municipal Health Promotion Center, and the Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Center answered the 10 disinfection questions that citizens care about, and also sorted out 8 points for the correct disinfection. Q: How to disinfect the items in the home? Answer: Commonly used small items such as mobile phones, remote controls, mouses, door handles, faucet, various buttons, etc. 70%-80%alcohol cotton balls or disinfected wet towels can be used to wipe and disinfect. Large -scale objects such as desktops and ground can be sprayed, wiped or dragged for disinfection with disinfectant with 500 mg/L with effective chlorine (bromine) 500 mg/L. We clothes, bedding and other fabrics can be exposed to the sun, and generally do not use special disinfection. Washing pools and toilets can be used for disinfection with chlorine -containing disinfection. The first choice of tableware is the first choice for boiling and disinfection for 15-30 minutes, or for 30 minutes circulating steam, or the tableware disinfection cabinet can be operated according to the instructions. You can also use 20-500 mg/L to soak for 30 minutes after soaking the chlorine (bromine) disinfection solution, and then wash it with water. When disinfection in circulation, there should be a gap in the placement of the tableware, and it must not be placed closely to avoid affecting the disinfection effect. It should be ensured that the tableware should be completely immersed. Do not increase the dosage of disinfection at home at home, especially do not pour disinfection and vote for disinfection tablets at will. Q: How to disinfect group purchase and express packages? Answer: When picking up the goods, wear a mask, gloves, and take a non -contact receipt. The outer packaging of the item can be sprayed with disinfectant or disinfected wet towels, and it can be placed for 10-30 minutes. Carton boxes, packaging bags, etc. should be left out of the door as much as possible and put in the trash. Fresh foods can be rinsed or soaked, dry, and dry. After the processing is completed, use ""soap/hand -sanitrigo + flowing water"" in time to clean your hands by ""seven -step washing method"". Q: How to disinfect vegetables and fruits? Answer: It is not easy to dehydrate and deteriorate (potatoes, radishes, onions, apples, etc.), which can be placed on the balcony for some time. Easy to dehydrate, deteriorate vegetables (greens, garlic seedlings, bean sprouts, etc.), can be rinsed, soaked and washed slowly, and storage is drained. Generally speaking, the outer packaging of vegetables and fruits can spray disinfection agents to reduce risks. For the fruits and vegetables itself, they only need to clean them. Do not use chemical disinfectants to disinfect to avoid affecting food safety and taste. If there is a disinfection, the disinfectant with fruits and fruits can be used. According to the concentration on the instructions, soak for 10-30 minutes, and rinse the residual disinfection with water. Q: Can I spray clothes with a disinfectant? Answer: Under normal circumstances, the probability of personal coats carrying new coronary viruses is less likely; secondly, chemical disinfection plants such as pedestrian disinfection channels are directly sprayed on the human body, because the spraying time is too short, and the amount of spray is too small. No disinfection effect. Q: Can the disinfectant spray air? Answer: The positive probability of outdoor air virus is minimal. Even if the virus -containing air -soluble gels appear, the circulation air will quickly decompose and dilute it, almost not infectious. And spray disinfection outdoor, the disinfection time and disinfection time required for disinfection. Question: How to disinfect when going out and measuring acid when going home? Answer: Gently take off the coat and hang it in the ventilation position; take off the mask, and use it again, you should hang it in a dry and ventilated place; use the ""soap/sanitizer + flowing water"" to clean your hands in time; At the door, the upper can be wiped with disinfection wet towels; mobile phones, keys, etc., and wipe with 75%alcohol cotton balls or disinfected wet towels. Those who have conditions can distinguish the ""pollution zone"" and ""clean areas"" at home, and leave clothes and shoes that go back in the ""pollution zone"". Question: The neighbor in the building was infected with Covid-19, how should my home disinfection? Answer: Virus infections are conditional, causing body infection to be exposed to a certain number of viruses. There is no evidence that the virus in the air can cause infection when the concentration is very low. If the neighbors of the same building are infected, it is the most important thing to keep the room clean, tidy and ventilated at home.

Space,Another spring,Space,"Wu Shuangchun is a season that people like, because of her beauty. I also like spring. The air that breathe has become less cold. There is no need to surround the thick scarf on the neck. The mask becomes humid because the breathing will become wet, which is the result of rising temperature. Walking on the road, you will obviously feel that there is a trace of sweetness in the air, and there will be a feeling of being blown by the wind on the forehead. It's the so -called spring breeze. Those who have experienced the cold winter will be grateful for everything in spring, so all the deepest praise in the world will become the gorgeous clothes of spring. But is spring really perfect? I think of a plot in ""A Dream of Red Mansions"": one in the early spring, a little girl said to another little girl, how can you be so frowning? Is it sick? I heard people say that people are willing to be sick in the spring. If you do n’t go to ask Miss Lin, there are many medicines, and you go to eat with her. Another girl said, go! A medicine is also mixed? In fact, I ca n’t remember the specific plot, but I remember the phrase “the people are willing to be sick in the spring”, because it was a brand new common sense for me when I was a kid. When I first read ""Dream of Red Mansions"", I was only about ten years old. When I saw the little girl's mouth, I felt very fresh. Oh, when the spring arrives, people with old aging diseases will be sick. Perhaps this is the so -called ""recovery of all things"". What everything refers to things is not just a new positive thing, but also something on the other, such as egg bugs, such as diseases, such as bacteria, viruses, etc. That happened when I felt troublesome and uncomfortable. During the Spring Festival, I bought two fashionable thin sweater, and happily worn on my body, replacing it with the old, and I was comfortable. Who knew that two days later, I felt itchy, and I took off my sweater at night and found that a lot of red dots emerged on the two arms, and suddenly realized that there was a problem with the newly bought sweater. how could be? The sweater is new and bought in a serious mall, is it because of my allergies? But such a large area of allergies have not happened for many years. I had to take off my sweater. I washed it a few times and soaked with a laundry solution and a soft agent. After drying it, I still dared not wear it again. I wanted to throw it away. Looking at the unique color and style, I was unwilling. I had to press several fragrant insect -proof cakes into the wardrobe, and I didn't dare to touch it again. Coincidentally. A few days ago, the sewer of the kitchen suddenly didn't fall into the water. When I was a child, Feng Feng shouted and shouted me: Sister! Come and see! I washed the bowl, and suddenly the foam came from under the pool cabinet! I ran to see, the sewer was blocked, and the dishwashing liquid was full of the kitchen. Quickly let her turn off the water pipe, don't move the pool first. I hurriedly found a bottle of ""pipelines"", a layer of gray soil was covered, and the gray soil was carefully and looked at it. It expired two years ago. I hurriedly ran to the hardware supplies store outside the two streets to buy back a bottle of pipeline to come back. Sprinkle a lot of water in the pool cabinet. Lying on the ground to observe the water flow, and holding his sleeves and stretching his arms into the position of the floor drain to explore the situation, making my head, arms, hands, and pants legs sticking with black and sticky dirty things. The sewage pipe is made. You said, how can the water pipe be blocked for a long time, why is it blocked at this time? Is it because the temperature has risen and thermal expansion and contraction, causing the accumulation of the pipeline to make a break? Just a few days after stopping, there was a problem with my cat. The 14 -year -old cat Dabai, who was often exposed on my Douyin live broadcast and was quite popular, suddenly made a skin disease. It always uses his mouth to stab its own hair, especially on both sides and back of the body, and later developed on the stomach. At the beginning, I sorted it with a comb, thinking that it was a general discomfort. Later, I felt wrong. The white dander fell down. Do you have dermatitis or cat ringworm? Take out the cat bag, stuff the big white in, and take it to the pet hospital. Do a skin test and a blood test. The doctor said: Allergic dermatitis. For a few days, I took an injection, took medicine, rubbed the medicine, and soaked in. Finally, I saw Dabai quiet, no longer scratching my hair with my mouth, my mood was not restless, and the living state returned to normal. Spring is here, the ice and snow fades, the hard land begins to be soft, the temperature rises, the ground is heating, the green grass germinated, and the spring flower peach blossoms bloom. But don't forget that maggots also began to move, and various bacteria also entered the rhythm of reproduction. The birth of a new life must be accompanied by the existence of another negative thing. This is the law that the world we survive. The other side of life was dead, and behind the survival was dying. We should not be as pessimistic as Lin Daiyu. She is a person who is scattered and uncomfortable, because she cannot tolerate separation and loss. Yes, it is not long in spring and summer, and it will come in autumn and winter. But I also remember another famous saying: Winter is here, will spring be far away? My family is good, and I have recovered. But this morning, the neighbors told me that her cat buns were sick, the urinary system was infected, and she was hospitalized.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-22/8.htm,4/22/22,8th Edition: Nights Cup,,True

The old people would not buy vegetables with mobile phones. Volunteers have built a list of elderly care. I claimed that six elderly people who lived alone or children were not around, built a small group, and every time I bought food, I would ask in the small group. purchase? Buy it well and help them send them to the door. It's just a small movement, which is the work of holding hands, but they get a lot of thanks and feedback. There is a particularly enthusiastic man in the resident group. He has rich resources. He has helped everyone a few times of vegetables, meat and rice, and some frozen foods. In addition to milk, I can help docking. Others can do as volunteers, help carry and distribute materials, and help the elderly who help the neighborhood committees to provide meals. The demand of residents can be responded in time, and with sufficient material guarantee, she can resist the disease at home. Today is the 21st day of the closure of the community. Although he was more distressed in the epidemic, he unexpectedly received the rapid heating up the neighborhood relationship. The story of a simple and beautiful society in the early days, helping each other to cross the difficulty, always happened at all times, and it feels very warm. Starting from a bottle of fresh milk, I opened the interaction between my neighbors. I often send small things at the door: a pack of spices, a burger, a toast bread with a bottle jam ... Give ginseng tea, a box of eggs, a pack of rice, the younger sister will help me grabbing takeaway ... When I know what other people need, they will be transferred to people who need help than me, especially older. resident. I have to go to work every morning and afternoon. At the same time, I have to answer the questions of many residents, especially the elderly, and sometimes I am busy until I eat a meal at night. I feel tired. Helping others is the foundation of happiness, and the feedback obtained is priceless. After all, this epidemic will pass, but I believe that the Shanghai people who have passed the difficulties will always remember the warm time of this neighborhood. I am a Taiwan compatriot. My parents and my parents are from the mainland. They were originally a family. Six years ago, I followed my husband to work in Shanghai and was helped by neighbors on the same floor. Now I can give back to me a little power. Shanghai is facing unprecedented challenges. If everyone can do a little more, this society will get better and better. I found the same story that repeatedly happened in each community. I am very happy at this time I am in Shanghai and move forward with everyone. My name is 806 little king. I will never forget the deep feelings brought to me during this time. Wang Yan",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-23/7.htm,4/23/22,No. 7 Edition: Shanghai News,,True
Space,"Little Orange ""Medicine Shop""",Space,"Lao Zhou Xiaozi is a new Shanghai native. She and her husband were born in 1993 and have been in Shanghai from Sichuan for less than three years. Living into the community is only about a year. Little Orange is her WeChat name. She has a brother with a word ""orange"" in the name, and she likes to eat oranges, so she takes her WeChat name as ""Little Orange"". During the epidemic, Little Orange became a red man in the community. The two couples were originally learned to design. In recent years, they have made a lot of pharmacy design and decoration, so they are familiar with a pharmacy in the surrounding area. Knowing that the elderly in the community went out to distribute medicine, the neighborhood committee was difficult to solve it for a while. Little Orange tried to contact the pharmacies and volunteered to go out for the residents of the community. A group of little oranges, huh, come in hundreds of people. Everyone's drug needs are really: there are basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension, some who want to alcohol and thermometer, some Chinese medicines such as the flowers of the flowers, and the antigen reagent ... In short, there are eight flowers. Little oranges usually go to the goods once a week. Before entering the medicine, the little oranges have to check the information repeatedly, and there are several large pieces of paper under densely. Medicine is a big deal, you can't make mistakes. She did not hurry to collect money, but packed first, and padded in more than 20,000 yuan once. Buy good medicine, find car transportation, find someone to move. That day, the epidemic in the community was tight, and there were more orders for the purchase of sterilized alcohol. The little oranges took the goods and let the driver be transported to the community door. When the sun was directly sunburned, I threw a help information in the buying medicine group: Who can come down to help? As a result, a 50 -year -old uncle came down for a long time. The big box of wine was really heavy, and finally I had to decide to send a notice to the buyer and divide it on the spot. A 60 -year -old Shanghai grandfather's uncle shakes away to pick up alcohol. He saw the little oranges and the uncle who had come down to help before sweating, and muttered: Louji is difficult to buy alcohol. It ’s really embarrassed to buy it, but it’ s unwilling to buy it. Little Orange is not angry or complained, but he is happy. In fact, she doesn't feel that she is not from Shanghai. She feels that she has already become a member of this community. ""You see, I don’t know how many people in the community. She also comforted the uncle, ""Noon, everyone may be sleeping, and most of them are old people who buy medicine, which is inconvenient."" Little Orange can think in other ways. There were still people who doubted whether she wanted to make money from it, otherwise who would be so free? Little Orange does not explain. Every time I give the invoice sheet to buy the medicine to the other party, there are a few points, which is refreshing. Each medicine is sold at a parity and does not make a penny! Not only that, she also paid by herself, and the residents received the payment when they received the medicine. Little Orange said she chose to trust. But obviously, not everyone is trustworthy. Once, the residents in a building obviously asked for ten boxes of flowers to clear the plague capsule, and also had antigen reagents, and repeatedly confirmed in the group. "" In this money, Little Orange had to eat it by itself. Little Orange lives in Building 2. As soon as the medicine arrived, after the division, she moved a table at the corner of the door of the house, and then called one by one in the large group. Let's take it. What impressed the little orange was that there was a aunt who was in his 70s and took medicine alone. She bought a non -Luo Di flat -release tablet, a medicine for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Auntie came to pay for medicine. She had no WeChat nor Alipay, and she brought a bunch of change. Little Orange: At this time, who still collects banknotes? Xiao Orange really wanted to give the aunt for exemption directly, but it was actually not much money, but I thought it was not good. I still collected it after repeated disinfection. She doesn't want the old man to feel ""disgusted"". ""If this aunt is my old man, I don't want them to feel bad. For the old and weak, we should just care more."" Little Orange also has grandparents and grandparents in the house. The elderly who are thousands of miles pass the phone and greetings, so that the old people can rest assured. Later, she prescribed a ""pharmaceutical shop"" in the community and went out for the residents to buy medicine. I never told her family, ""I'm afraid they are worried, and every time they take care of me: good at home, do not go anywhere, don’t go anywhere . I don't want them to worry about me. I am pretty good in Shanghai. ""Just now, she is a volunteer in the community as a volunteer. She is too busy. Every day, the phone is about to be exploded by the neighbors of the community. On one occasion, she even received a SMS notification from China Mobile: This phone uses abnormalities and needs to take protective measures for your number. After some explanations, the line continued. Resident residents are grateful. That day, Xiao Orange said in the group: The weather was really hot. As a result, I received a lot of gifts at once: drinks, cold drinks, and oranges. ""This is the rhythm of feeding me."" Not the residents of this community also began to ask her to help buy medicine. The two are too busy now, and do one thing to do it solidly. Moreover, I always have to be responsible for myself and the residents in the community. ""Little Orange said repeatedly that he is not great. It is also very ""greedy for death"". That day, I didn't see the antigen test for a while, thinking that she had two bars, and she collapsed all at once. ""I couldn't hold it all at once, and I cried for a while."" It's wrong. Little Orange said nothing, immediately wiped his tears, and turned to get the medicine again.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-23/8.htm,4/23/22,,,True

Except for a few patients with extremely critical condition, the designated hospital of the West Hospital of Shuguang Hospital basically achieved full coverage of traditional Chinese medicine treatment. In the face of critical patients with basic diseases, the hospital established a severe medical team to carry out multi -disciplinary treatment of the original basic disease.

She also takes a three -year -old daughter. She asked for help in the circle of friends. I think of a brother Yuan Jianguo in the reading group. He is a small farm called Yamana in Chongming. On April 6, I called Lao Yuan countless telephones and did not get through. Until 10 pm, the call was connected. He told me that he was sending vegetables at Minhang, and he went to the gate at a high speed. I just begged him to help Bei Cai's mother and daughter. He grunted hoarsely: ""I didn't eat meals, and I was delivered to the middle of the night today."" Promise to add one tomorrow. At twelve o'clock in the evening, I chased a phone call to confirm.

The Chongming Chenqiao has passed the Yangtze River Bridge and Tunnel of more than 30 kilometers, and he sent more than 1,000 dishes in three days. At two o'clock in the morning, I rushed to the airport town and walked around countless curves. Finally, I saw an old couple waiting on the side of the road. When Master Yuan took the vegetables, Lao Yuan was in a hurry to get out of the car, and his feet fell to the ground when his feet were soft. The old couple looked at the old couple full of silver hair: ""If you don't go, your life is also important! God will remember it on the book, good people report!"" Lao Yuan said, ""It's worth it, it is worth it."" Yuan was originally a ""boss"". In 2010, he wanted to live a rural leisure life. He rented 86 acres of land in Chongming, raised chicken, ducks, plant rice and vegetables, friends, and fishing. The days in the countryside are relaxed and happy, but they have met the epidemic. Originally, Chongming was also sealed. He simply stopped the conventional food delivery work. I did not expect that countless friends who came out suddenly burst the phone call and asked him to send out the dishes for emergency. Lao Yuan looked at his two -year -old wife and rubbed his hands and said, ""There is no way, it's all friends."" Master Yuan said: ""In this life, I followed the toss."" When people drove, she forced her to sleep until six o'clock. She accompanied the car and brought gum, tens of gold oil and a large pot of coffee to prevent fatigue driving. Lao Yuan drove, Master Yuan was responsible for calling. He always had to go 500 kilometers a day and burned a box of 60 liters of oil every day. Every time I encounter a high -speed rest station, go to the toilet. Buy some water at noon to eat snacks. Dinner must be eaten after going home in the middle of the night. I don't want to take a bath. At this time, the epidemic was even more urgent. It is a friend. If this Chen Guang does not help, it really becomes a friend of wine and meat everywhere, and no one will be saved at the critical moment. ""The couple decided"" good people to do it.

But for these ""friends"" that emerged, the two of them had the courier brothers who sent the door to the door. On the 15th, one of my Wen friends called and told me that her friends lived in a pair of old couples in Yangpu District. Seeing that the materials at home decreased day by day without grabbing food. When my friend was in a hurry, I asked me to ask Lao Yuan to rescue the emergency. I can only ask Lao Yuan to ""Gasai"" again. He agreed again, ""All are friends."" The next day he gave priority to the Yangpu family. When Master Yuan was wearing a protective suit and handed the dishes over the railing, a white bangs floated in the spring breeze.

Space,Hundred years old Kong Rou,Space,"In the past few days, Mr. Kongrou ushered in the joy of Yiyi. Among the poets in Shanghai, there are many elderly lives, but only Kong Rou has entered the threshold of the 100 -year -old. Recently, I went to his house to worship, and he said that he had seen me and remembered it. I was surprised by his memory. More than two decades ago, he held a poetic activity in the Association's Hall. Among the many members, he always arrived early and sat on the last seat. At the end of the meeting, he left alone. Later, he gradually came, and I gradually forgot him. When I met, I asked him that he had not participated in poetry activities for many years. He replied that his old thoughts were not sharp, and his poetic feelings were not agile. He mainly wrote some old poems, so he was embarrassed. I think that some poets enter the old realm and gradually stay away from the new poems and regain their old poems. Mr. Xin Di wrote a lot of old poems in his later years, and said to me: New poems are easy to learn and difficult! The old body poems look difficult to write, and it is not difficult to enter the door. Kong Rou and Xin Di have the same writing. In his life, he was happy, and he spit it quickly. He integrated the armpit. Twenty years ago, he published the collection of old style poems ""The Floating Collection"". The name of this book is his life compared to the sea canoe in the sea, floating in the wind and waves. He wrote a new poem to write old poems, and also wrote a comment on ""Going into the Mind World"", and also translated a number of scripts such as the novel ""Dawn"" and Iraracida ""Lantern"". His experience is unique and rich among Shanghai poetry people. In April 1922, Kong Rou was born in a book incense in Qufu, Shandong, next to Longhu Street under Mount Tai. In Confucius, the poems are deeply traditionally traditionally. He is in the court training. After finishing his homework daily, he has to read some classical poems. In addition to the Book of Songs, there are also Tang poems and modern poems translated from European and American poets. Starting from the excerpts of the famous sentences, I am obsessed with five words and seven, and also learned graffiti. However, the Japanese invaded China in an all -round way, and Qufu had fallen, and the school could not let a calm desk. He and his progressive classmates yearn for Yan'an and quietly left home. He went to Xi'an via Nanjing, Bengbu, and Luoyang. However, due to traffic blocked, he went to Chongqing behind the big rear and was admitted to Chongqing Minzhi News College. Along the way, the scene of the country's death and the people of the people was miserable. Kong Rou was sad and excited, and his poetic was full of blood. He thought that in such a harsh environment, he must reflect this era in a more powerful poetry form. He began to abandon the writing of old -body poems, expressing his mind with new poems to meet the needs of fast -paced real life. He and several classmates who love poetry were not afraid of the sinister environment and the poverty of the economy. He established the ""Poist Poetry Society"". Everyone would rather bear the hunger. In addition to writing poems by themselves, they also asked the famous poets, Xu Chi, and Wang Yaiping to send poems in Chongqing. After the first issue, he received many praise. They continue to work hard and quickly arrange the second period of manuscript. However, due to the advancement of the content of the poetry and the interference of the authorities, coupled with a sufficient printing fee for a while, the second phase was finally born in the death. After the victory of the Anti -Japanese War, Kong Rou came to Shanghai and could not find a job for a while. He used the time to write poems, and chose appropriate ones such as ""Pao Tong"" and ""Give Fan Yan"", and published them in the supplements of ""Poetry Creation"" and ""Dagong"". Once, in the case of living, he kept a friend of his leather box in the storage room of the Xinmin Daily. Due to the tendency to make progress in newspapers, it was seized by the authorities. After the setting off, after the newspaper broke out, Kong Rou rushed to the newspaper to find his own suitcase, but he could not find it. He was not some clothes in the box, but the precious collection of precious poems he bought, and his letters and letters of poetry friends. I remember that there were more than twenty poems in the manuscript, of which ""narrowed winding slate tract/bamboo fence cottage"", which wrote the status quo of the suffering of the year. There are also sentences of ""fighting fires and flying like Taoyuan here"", writing an optimistic attitude in a difficult environment. After 1949, Kong Rou was transferred from the Post Office to the Editorial Publishing House as the editor -in -chief, and then to Beijing, and served as the editor of the theoretical reading of the worker publisher. He remembers that in order to group a good manuscript, he boldly opened the door of the People's Literature Publishing House, and was warmly received and strongly supported by the president Wang Renhu (Ba Ren). In the 1950s, he was mistaken for ""right"" and decentralized in Yunnan. With his literary skills, he entered the editorial department of ""Frontier Literature and Art"" and served as the poem team leader. At the beginning of the new period, Kong Rou was an editor -in -chief of the ""Harvest"" magazine that has been rehabilitated and returned to the long -awaited Shanghai. After reading, I couldn't help but be able to write ""Postscript"" and published it in the magazine of ""Harvest"" that year. In those years, in the editorial department of ""Harvest"", it was Kong Rou's most comfortable happy time. That year, under the leadership of Bajin and Wu Qiang, he and the editors of the editorial department and the young and middle -aged writers from all over the world wrote a masterpiece after attending the first creation of Mogan Mountain to participate in the re -publication. Pakistan wrote the postscript of ""Equipment"", and the money was ""in Mogan Mountain on August 10, 1981"". For the eight days of the pen, Kong Rou's poetic rose was rising, writing a set of ""Mogan Mountain Miscellaneous"" (six songs). Later, he went to Hangzhou with the elderly writer and old editor to live in the ""Creation Home"" for a few days to talk to you about life exchanges. ""Harvest"" old colleague Peng Xinqi knew much about Kong Rou's character and high evaluation. It is said that Kongrou from Shanghai to Beijing to Yunnan, and has been separated for a long time, but has no complaints. He has won the honor of the national excellent literary editor. He is a good editor who is really obscure and is a wedding dress for writers.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-24/7.htm,4/24/22,,,True
Space,Shape a beautiful heart for children,Space,"Chuan Zhongfu Children's Art Theater is 75 years old. I am a few years older than it, it is its old ""fan"". For decades, it has been unforgettable for my spiritual inspiration and artistic appreciation. There are too many content, just talk about it from the perspective of the repertoire. Children's art was under the care of Chairman Song Qingling himself, breaking the soil in the darkest day before dawn. When it was formally established, it has ushered in the brilliant sunshine of New China. As the earliest art group for children, it has become a good teacher and friend of generations, leaving beautiful memories in the hearts of countless audiences. The decades of children's achievements can be reflected most clearly from its drama. Before 1949, I was still a primary school student, and I had been in contact with the ""Table"" and ""Little Master"" they played, leaving a deep impression. After 1949, from ""Snowflake"" and ""Little White Rabbit"" to ""Friendship"" and ""Preparation of Moment"" reflecting children's lives, they all attracted the vast number of audiences. In particular, some of the short dramas and songs, song and dance programs they arranged, such as ""We all have one volunteer"", ""two small captains"", etc., went deep into school performances, and even counseled the small students themselves. When I was on the first day, I played the ""Huang Dabao's OK"" written by Teacher Sun Yi. These plays are vivid and vivid, with diverse forms, full of the atmosphere of the times, and entertaining, which has greatly educated children. Later, the successful performance of ""Ma Lanhua"" opened a unique road to the creation of Chinese fairy tale dramas. It can be seen that from the beginning, children's art has laid a good foundation in the direction and practice of the repertoire. After work, children's drama has seen less, but at the same time, it feels that it has gradually grown up and mature. After retirement, especially in these decade, I have become its audience again. In close contact with it, I have become more and more realized that it has formed its own characteristics on the repertoire. Its drama is mainly based on modern themes, and has never forgotten the main service target is children. It has a lot of themes that reflect the revolutionary struggle, but try to focus on children's lives, such as ""Underground Young Pioneer"" and ""Children's Drama"". It is more about the story of contemporary children. The horizons are wide and ingenious, not only limited to family and classrooms, but not ears and diagram policies. For example, ""There is a pink cloud in the mountains"", communicate with the children of Shanghai and the ethnic minorities in the southwestern southwest. Through the clever plot, in the context of the difference between the differences between urban and rural areas and regions, it reflects the true appearance of Chinese children's lives. Practical education for them and struggle. Another example is ""Encay"". The story takes place in the environment of the earthquake. The protagonist is a child who loves drumming. Through his unique experience of his drums, he has shaped the image of a little protagonist who dares to fight and fight. They did not forget the ancient subjects, and insisted on digging from the treasures of Chinese traditional culture to the spiritual food that was beneficial to niche audiences. They have performed ""Sima Guang"" and ""Dayu Governance"", and also performed ""Oriental Story"" composed of several fragments, such as ""Yan Zixiao Chu"" and ""Sanke Lane"". The latter can also enter school, combined with teaching. It is hoped that in this regard, classical literary factors represented by ancient poems can be better integrated. Fairy tales and myths are important spiritual food for children. Children's art has achieved significant achievements in this regard. They successfully performed the fairy tale masterpiece ""The Daughter of the Sea"", ""Twelve months"", ""The Ugly Princess"" ... Created and performed new fairy dramas like ""White Horse Feifei"", which can be described as unique in the combination of fairy tales and real life. They also creatively adapted the famous films like Titanic into a fairy tale and changed the characters into animals such as cats and dogs. It's not easy. They also adapted world masterpieces such as ""Notre Dame"" and ""Misery World"", and worked hard on cultural popularization. The years are flowing, the children's art is not forgotten, and the hardships are constant. Recently, they were re -line up ""Song Qingling and Children"". I felt very good when I watched it. It should be refined into a reserved repertoire, so that it will always flash in the children's drama garden in China and the world in China and the world.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-24/8.htm,4/24/22,8th Edition: Nights Cup,,True

Space,The story of Building No. 19,Space,"Weng Yang's epidemic came, and the rhythm of people's lives and work was disrupted. Waiting quietly at home, the best performance is not to leave home. The outside world has calmed down, and people's hearts are inevitably disturbed and worried. Fortunately, the charm of life often allows you to see light in the dark, and enjoy joy in sorrow. After living in the building for 18 years, we suddenly received the call from the organization: ""We live in the same building, called the"" No. 19 Garden City Phase II "", everyone actively enters the group and help each other."" Do you come and go? ""The 54 households in our building are happy to enter the"" big family "", and the family does not fall. With ""big head"" and ""big living room"". In the face of the anti -epidemic war, we no longer fight alone, and 138 family members have become a group. Two years ago, the COVID-19 virus invaded Shanghai and was very satisfied with the anti-disinfecting work of his own building, thinking that it was accurate to be the cleaners responsible for cleaning the floor. After entering the door, I learned that the two elevators and the environmental disappearance of the 18 -story corridor were conscious actions of residents in this building. The leader is Teacher Chen, Room 602. He paid for his own pocket, spent money to buy disinfectant and watering pots, and consciously do a good job of disinfecting the corridor every day in proportion. Beginning in March of this year, four or five old gentlemen in the building took the initiative to take turns to enter the battle, carefully and thoughtful and thoughtful. Terminate each other, help each other, and encourage each other to become the door of Building 19. During the epidemic, there were more than seven things that opened the door of the residential building. Nucleic acid screening, antigen detection, material distribution, meals for the elderly, seeking medical treatment for medical treatment, buying food, garbage management ... complicated work. In the face of this test papers, Chen Wanhong, the team leader of Room 502, is a big family. She said that it wasn't how magically she was individual because there was a group of people behind her. The tasks arranged by the cadres of the neighborhood committee were hung in the ""Living Room"", and the volunteers in the building had grabbed the order. Usually do not show up, showing his hands in war. Surprised found that there were all ways to hide in the 19th. The list of 54 households on the 18 floors found out at once, and the basic state of each house also understood. The 7 team leaders were born. Households can pass the test results in time. The sharing of everyone who can get vegetables and milk was originally a ""family doctor"" that medical staff re -fired the old industry. Good for cooking in the living room. The clever women race different cooking skills in the same vegetable. When going out to test, the old man needs a wheelchair. The rice -roasted rice lacks salt meat. The lack of garlic and ginger. You squeake what you ask for in the ""big living room"" and immediately send enthusiastic people to the door. I also accidentally missed a sentence and did not buy cabbage. Sister Wei, the 1302 room, immediately sent it to the door. There are often chief engineers, university professors, educational experts, scientists, and financialists who often come out with doubts. There are also young young people who like to take the humorous paragraph to make my uncle smile easily ... Nucleic acid testing is praised. The 138 people in Building 19 are the most neat, the most important rules, and the most civilized and polite. Everyone immediately put on a mask and said ""thank you"" immediately after testing. When the medical staff finished working, I heard so many ""thank you"" for the first time today, which is really warm. The residents in Building 19 were proud of this feedback. Medical staff in other provinces and municipalities came to assist in the help. Shanghai citizens need to know the grace. This has become a new round of topic. For the first time in my life, I participated in the work of issuing antigen test reagents. It was distributed from house to house. It was not afraid and was quite satisfied. To clarify the essentials and precautions of the operation, the other thanks of the other thanks warm heart. Fighting with such a reasonable citizen, the victims are full of confidence. At 8 am on April 5th, there were three more than three of the antigen detection results. There was no echo for the call of the mobile phone. He went upstairs and knocked on the door and asked the situation. The dad in Room 1802 was embarrassed to say hello to everyone: ""Sleep late, the mobile phone is quiet, my family is all overcast, thank you for your concern."" At 4:30 in the morning, the small birds in the shade of the tree shared, and the trail was busy. A 69 -year -old, 18 -year -old, volunteer in Building 19 is two generations of Shanghai good men.

In these days, each nucleic acid detection is a middle -aged male volunteer ""shouting wheat"" again and again, full of energy and power. With many previous experiences, today's all -member nucleic acid detection can be described as smooth and smooth. The community made full use of the existing space to design a fixed line for each residents of each building, and even use the cobblestone road that winds in the green belt. The heavy rain last night made the path a little muddy, and the ""big white"" was covered with wooden boards in advance.

SPACE,"After the intervention of Chinese medicine, patients can speed up the cabin","—— Zhang Boli, an academician visiting the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine","On April 24th, Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, was interviewed by the media on the relevant issues of this round of epidemic in Shanghai. He said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, the core disease of Omikon's mutant strain has not changed significantly compared with the previous, and it still belongs to the category of ""epidemic"" disease in traditional Chinese medicine. The cause is to feel the epidemic. Different factors such as eating habits are slightly different in syndrome characteristics. The performance of cold, hot, drying, and stasis appears. Shanghai is a kind of wet poisonous wind heat. Zhang Boli believes that the square cabin hospital has played an important role in classification and layered treatment. ""For the treatment of asymptomatic infections, Western medicine is asymptomatic, and Chinese medicine has evidence. For example, some asymptomatic infected people, although there are no symptoms of COVID-19, may be burnout, greasy tongue, stagnant stool, abdominal distension, abdominal distension TCM and other traditional Chinese medicine syndromes are used at this stage to intervene in time with Chinese medicine to regulate the immune function. They can often achieve better results, so that they do not become the diagnostic, and promote the rapid transition of nucleic acids. ""Therefore, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine is adopted. Active intervention is to promote the rapid turns of nucleic acids, prevent the progress of the disease, and reach the compartment standards at an early date and return to normal life. According to Zhang Boli, from the perspective of the preliminary use, COVID-19 virus infection was asymptomatic. After the use of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in patients with mild patients, it showed a good efficacy trend in reducing the rotation rate and reducing the time out of the cabin. Earlier, a data from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine showed that the average nucleic acid to the yin of the asymptomatic infection in the cabin was about 4 days. At the same time, according to the needs of patients, under the premise of voluntary, taking Chinese medicine, such as Chinese medicine, formula particles, etc. The three principles Zhang Boli revealed the situation of the elderly infected in the Shanghai epidemic. ""First, the proportion of elderly people over the age of 60 in the case of confirmed cases accounts for 30 %; second, most elderly people have basic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, tumor, uremia, etc. COVID-19 is added together, which will lead to serious illness, and the condition is progressing rapidly. It is easy to turn into severe and critical illnesses. It needs to pay special attention. ""Zhang Boli introduced that the first principle of the treatment of elderly infections is"" new and old diseases take care of both new and old diseases take care "", COVID-19, pay more attention to the treatment of basic diseases, and pay particular attention to basic disease changes. From the perspective of treatment experience, it is not difficult to treat COVID-19 alone, but it is difficult to treat unstable basic diseases. The second principle is ""to righteousness and dispel evil."" The elderly often lack of righteousness, virtual damage, poor blood, poor blood, phlegm turbid stasis and other basic disease evidence. It is easy to increase quickly after infection with the COVID-19 virus. , Adopt methods such as qi and promoting blood, nourishing qi and nourishing yin. In the evil evil, pay attention to ""Qing"" and ""Tong"", and can be used to clear heat and detoxify, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. The third principle is the treatment of the first movement, the symptoms of the symptoms, and cut off the disease. Patients from asymptomatic to symptoms are a process, and they need to intervene early. For example, in clinical practice, although some elderly patients seem to be ordinary, when the fever continues to continue, the stool, constipation, phlegm sticky, and the lungs are not absorbed, they must hurry up. Time treatment. The key is to grasp the symptoms of the disease that may affect the worsening of the disease at that time, and treat the development of the disease. Zhang Boli said that it is necessary to distinguish between high -risk people and attach importance to basic diseases, multi -disciplinary union, early intervention, syndrome discrimination, one person and one strategy, seize the main symptoms and core disease machines to determine the strategy of combining clinical treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. One ""early"" and ""quasi"" Zhang Boli believes that for the treatment of patients with severe and critical illnesses, the first thing to emphasize is multi -disciplinary cooperation. Each subject exerts its own advantages and collective efforts. , Reversing the disease and reducing the disease rate. According to factors such as basic diseases, the most dangerous factors of each patient adopt the method of dialectical and targeted treatment strategies for each patient. Specifically, it is a ""early"", a ""quasi"", early discovery, early warning, early research, and early intervention. Take targeted precision treatment, ""one person, one policy, one person, one side, one party one party"" method. Specific treatment should be ""fast"", sometimes ""stable"", patiently observe the changes in symptoms, and stability is not aggravated. Sometimes it is necessary to ""support"". Yang Qifu should use large doses to attach back to Yang to rescue the reverse, and to turn the tide. Traditional Chinese medicine injections are used in therapeutic drugs, Chinese medicine retains enema, ginseng powder, rhubarb powder, acupuncture therapy, etc. In emergency medication, the blood must be pushed by blood, phlegm heat and clear pumps, Angong Niuhuang Wan and other internal orbitals. It plays a good role in stabilizing the condition and blocking progress. Since the emergence of recovery COVID-19 epidemic, people have paid attention to whether there are sequelae. The patient can be discharged out of the cabin after complying with the requirements of relevant indicators. However, some people have not completely cured, some people have not fully recovered their immune function, and others have damaged the heart, liver, kidney, etc. due to the COVID-19 virus, and the functional indicators are not normal. Therefore, there is a process of recovery for COVID-19 patients with discharge. Zhang Boli introduced: ""Summarize the recovery of patients in Wuhan and the future epidemic. The concept of 'combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine is generally adopted, and western medicine does health assessment, and Chinese medicine promotes rehabilitation. ""According to reports, after active recovery, the relevant symptoms of most people are basically eliminated within three months to half a year. Zhang Boli pointed out that healing himself must also make positive mentality and mental state adjustments, and actively participate in recovery. In this regard, we should also emphasize that the patients who do not discriminate against COVID-19 in the society should have more care for them.

Among the nine actions of the Social Social Society of this city, the ""Community Management Action"" is ranked first. In recent days, the city's grass -roots communities have been going all out, keeping the door and optimistic people, and minimizing the gathering of personnel flow. The seal -controlled area strictly implements the requirements of ""not leaving the house and the service on -site""; the control area strictly implements the requirements of ""no people from the community (unit), and the peaks to take things""; Chengqiao Second Village Community in Changning District did not leave the house to serve the service team quickly assembled on the evening of April 24th.

Yu Hongjuan, the secretary of the party branch of Chengqiao Ercun, was in response to the small team of the material handling. Everyone and the cadres of the neighborhood committee were carried by the cadres of the neighborhood committee. At 8 pm, they sent all the materials to the residents' homes.

It is really inseparable from the eight words of"" not leaving the house and the service to the door "". The community is stable, the environment is neat, and the living of residents has been stable. It should have been turned around. Both positive patients and secrets have been transferred. The community has been tested for negative nucleic acid for several days. It can be said that it is getting safer. ""Chengqiao Second Village is an old -fashioned community with 1428 residents, with a population of nearly 3,000, and the elderly population accounts for more than 35%. The proportion of party members has reached 10%. ""I am a party member, I will go first."" Since the end of March, the newly established team of 200 people with young party members has been divided into nucleic acid samples, antigen distribution, medical treatment, material movement, garbage clearance and clearance and transportation. Six small teams such as the delivery of the meal, the division of labor and cooperation, and actively carried out the volunteer service of the epidemic prevention and control. Because the community is sampled every day, the workload is very large, and the nucleic acid sampling team also increases from the original 5 groups to 8 groups. As the number of volunteers increases and the number of times is increasing, the degree of cooperation becomes higher and higher, and the time of residents of community residents has shrunk from one and a half hours a day to two and a half hours. It is worth mentioning that the community adopts the detection method of ""residents do not move, big white movement"". In addition to the on -site test of the Yanglou or the special crowd, the normal building is the sampling person who arrives in the downstairs, and the residents go downstairs to test it. 66 There are 66 detection points in each building, minimizing the aggregation of personnel flow. The problem of garbage and transportation in the sealing community also needs to be very careful. The garbage clearance team led by the property manager starts from 7 pm to collecting domestic garbage from the gate of each unit, and then shipped to the gate of the community. It is always busy until 112 pm. In addition, the home delivery team will go to the neighborhood committee at noon every day to receive the box lunch to give love meals for 10 elderly people who live alone, and give them special care.

The reporter, the other six social workers' incarnations of the neighborhood committees sank into various communities, and there are more than 160 volunteers of party members, which are scattered in the buildings of various buildings. ""Considering that the former building team leader was older and was not used to smartphones, we asked party members volunteers, in -service party members to serve as the"" Leader of the Second Party Member Building ""."" Become a chapter to follow. At present, some physical partitions have been done in Zhonghai Yueting Community. The Western District Independence and Control District is uniformly exported to the entrance for property and social workers and nucleic acid testing personnel. Lu Yijun introduced that the ""not leaving home"" in the seal -control area was strictly implemented, and other residents and volunteers could not enter this area. The needs of materials and drugs are uniformly purchased by the town's material classes or the neighborhood committee. ""Strict characters are the head, but the service is meticulous."" The management in the prevention area in the Eastern District is also not loose. Among them, the elimination of foreign courier items is one of the key points. ""Delivery master Note: On -site antigen negative re -unload!"" At the door of the Yueting Community of Zhonghai, the delivery process was clearly written on the signs, and a special disinfection area was divided. Outside the community, a red carpet is covered by the shelves. The courier first disinfect the sole here. After the antigen is tested, it can be unloaded. These migrant items are uniformly disinfected by volunteers. After removing for 30 minutes, they are moved to the shelves on the inside of the community. Since the occurrence of this round of epidemic, Lu Yijun led six staff members to the neighborhood committee, and some have never returned home for more than 40 days. Lu Yijun is a second -child mother. Dabao in the family goes to elementary school and Erbao to kindergarten. It is when they need to take care of it, but they have not seen each other for more than a month. ""It was very difficult at first. During that time, I couldn't video with my children. When I saw their tears, I couldn't stop. Afterwards, I slowly adjusted my mentality."" Lu Yijun said, ""Other friends in the neighborhood committee also have no time to take care of it. Many children, many people are both husband and wife are fighting against the front line. We encourage each other and everyone cheers together. """" 7 people serve more than 7,000 residents, and one person can be ""thousands of troops and horses'."" Lu Yijun said They will rule out all difficulties and lead Xiangxin's residents to adhere to the position until they defeat the epidemic.

Space,The place where we stand is Shanghai,Space,"On April 5th, the ""Nightlight Cup"" of the New People's Evening News published the short essay I wrote, ""Thousands of Normal Days"". I used the white trails without any modification, and narrated the most common nucleic acid testing, ""Bai Bai"" and the neighborhood committee's anti -epidemic scenes of the Shanghai people who had seen it. Unexpectedly, the word 1500 stirred up the unexpected social response. First, the ""Chinese Art Headline"" of the Ministry of Culture carefully used red words to highlight the reading effect of key words, and received 185,000 readers like it. Sohu, Sina, Tencent, Netease, Shangguan, People's Information, Interface News ... major websites have reprinted. When the Xinhuanet Client Galaxy Office's studio was reproduced, the editor -in -chief of Ms. Zhang Shuyun asked the Shanghai painter Ye Xiong to carefully select the theme works of Shanghai painters such as Wang Jiafang, Zhu Xinchang, and Zhang Anpu. At the same time, Xinhua Finance and Guangming Daily The recommendation of China Military Network is recommended. On the day of the reproduction, 1.219 million readers clicked. As of my writing, 6 days after writing a total of 1.517 million. At this moment, Shanghai is not lonely, and the people of the whole country set their attention to Shanghai. Over the years, most of my texts are forced by newspapers and all aspects. In these days, I witnessed the raging epidemic and worried. The chief editor of the Luminous Cup urged me from time to time in a few days after the city sealed on April 1: ""Do you want to ask you to write a home experience?"" ""Can you come here today?"" ... Give me to me An example in life, especially ""refueling to Shanghai"", touched my tears at once. I should write for this city where I raised me and what my father and fellow who were struggling. I have worked in the Shanghai Writers Association for 8 years. Every year on November 25, we will hold a bouquet of flowers to the elderly for the elderly. Bayan taught us, tell the truth, and give the readers to readers. I don't want to moan without illness nor tipping it cheaply. I just want to express that even what I see is the truth of the surface. Therefore, I write the most common and no dramatic scenes. In the end, a period of WeChat of our street cadres, Xiaocheng, did not avoid the negative emotions in their hearts. Then, in order to ""return everyone to a"" everything as usual '"", we went forward. Living in Shanghai, we pass by almost every day with the skyscrapers in the top of the sky. They draw a modern skyline in the sun. In fact, the majesty of the skyscraper is supported by the foundation that is deeply tied underground. It is the 25 million Poping Shanghai people that support this great city, Shanghai. 25 million Shanghai people, do not leave home, can think about it, what does this mean? Everyone is silently endured, persisted, fighting the invisible Omikon, testing again and again, again and again, and countless buildings. The difficulty of overcoming, and there are many new words of ""time and space companion"", writing a silent and tragic page. Different from the hero of the war, the hero fried bunkers and the eyes of the gun, the hero of the peaceful age is in adversity and crisis, watching each other. Needless to say, we heard crying and had pain, but we also shouted, more helpful ... Everyone adhered to the ""proud patience"" in Pushkin's verses with their own dignity. When the last few spring breeze passed our testing team this year, it must have heard our heartbeat. In 2020, COVID-19 raid the Jianghan Plain, and the Shanghai Medical Team went against the wind on New Year's Eve. I sent a period of WeChat that I later reposted on the entire network: ""I like two sides like a city: a little thing is afraid of death, such as lean ice; Heaven is not afraid of death, and life is righteous. The more civilized the city, the more personal the personal life value, and the more happy to the extreme of the personal life value. ""Remember that someone said that the place where you are standing is China, you are bright China is not dark. Yes, every Shanghai person stands, which is Shanghai, is the city of a great hero. We are bright, Shanghai is not dark! In the silent waiting, the back of the spring of 2022 was gradually disappearing in the fine rain of Jiangnan. From the found neighbor on April 7, a positive neighbor was allowed to be allowed to go downstairs for nucleic acid on April 19th. Now I found that all the golden ginkgo trees that were once golden. The hair is shining and sinking; there is a half -semi -maple tree stump that extends out of the corner of the building like a fire. Outside the window, the sun is just right. We are not leaving home. Looking up, the sky is more transparent than the sea water. In these days, I don't have no sadness and confusion, and WeChat WeChat that needs help and rescue from time to time. But seeing ""Dabai"", volunteers, property management, courier brother, neighborhood committee cadres, and doctors and nurses from all over the country. Their busy figures and tired face can only defeat myself weaknesses. Persevere ... I have persisted for so many days, and I have seen the virtuous light at the end of the long tunnel!

方舱建设者  上海建工集团副总裁  蔡国强,35天转战三家方舱医院,,    “我们必须适应每个工程的特点。工人干到什么时候，我就陪到什么时候。”    每天十几小时的连续工作、上百条通话记录、两三万的步数……年近60岁的上海建工集团副总裁蔡国强，在如此高强度的工作状态下，已“连轴转”了35天，投入到三家方舱医院的建设中，没有回过一次家。    蔡国强指挥建设的第一家方舱医院，在闵行体育馆。他与900多名技术人员和一线工人不分昼夜连续奋战72小时，将闵行体育馆改造成了一个能够容纳800个轻症和无症状感染者，且具有污水处理和空气净化功能的方舱医院。    由于体育场馆四面透风，闵行方舱医院改造难度非常大，工期又只有三天，所有建设者几乎没有睡觉的时间。蔡国强作为项目总指挥，基本也是工人干到什么时候，就陪到什么时候。    没多久，蔡国强又转战新国际博览中心方舱医院的建设中。“原本的设计方案在项目开工后，发现有部分不适应的地方，需要对污水废水排放系统的设计方案进行优化，蔡总在现场亲自参与指导，花了十几个小时做了调整，最终满足了工程需要。”上海建工安装集团党委书记、董事长黄震说。    184个小时后，蔡国强又马不停蹄转战金山方舱医院项目。此时的他已喉咙沙哑，靠喷雾药物维持才能说得出话。到达金山现场后，还是困难重重——金山方舱医院所在的厂房水电不足、墙体老旧斑驳、垃圾杂物堆积，整体施工基础较差、施工难度更大，建设者们4月8日进场时根本来不及整顿，也顾不上精细规划，只能边清场边施工。    到安装进水系统时，按原计划，相关设备材料是由外部的供应商提供和安装。然而因上海封控，供应商无法满足要求。蔡国强第一时间抽调了上海建工安装集团旗下的压力容器厂支援，当天就准备好了相关设备材料人员进场，按时完成了不锈钢水箱的安装工作。    每一个方舱建设项目都是时间紧、任务重，但蔡国强一直严把质量关，还经常考虑到细节问题。“涉及专业问题或工程质量等问题，蔡国强会变得非常强势，碰到问题汇报给他，他总能点出矛盾点，并指出一条解决路径。”上海建工五建集团总裁张勇回忆，蔡国强对每一道工序都会认真看一遍，在验收前看到分隔板的边角比较锋利，就要求买些角套装上，以免划伤入住病患。    最近，蔡国强又出现在了位于崇明花博园区P1、P2停车场的崇明临时隔离用房项目现场，这是上海建工集团在近一个月中，参与建造的第56个应急隔离设施项目。    本报记者  裘颖琼,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-27/5.htm,4/27/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
方舱医生  上海岳阳医院方舱医疗队副队长  邓玉海,抗疫老兵又一次逆行,,    “武汉封城忆犹新，魔都结界况未明。网格管理一体化，方舱控防待清零。外治法疗无症状，药食调治虑转轻。新冠执迷终不悟，扫却余毒自由行。”    邓玉海的微信签名，自2020年新冠疫情肆虐以来，就没变过：拒绝恐惧。    他也是这么做的，无论是驰援武汉雷神山医院，还是支援上海市公共卫生临床中心闵行老年医学中心临时执业点，抑或是现在战斗在虹口区纪念路方舱医院。    邓玉海是上海岳阳医院方舱医疗队副队长、消化内科副主任医师。每次逆行，这位抗疫老兵都没有多少犹豫。    别人喜欢叫他“老邓”，可人高马大的他在防护服背面写的昵称却是“小邓子”。他和队伍的第一站，是新国际博览中心方舱医院。在收治病人前夕，他一遍遍检查着舱内的每一处细节，奋战一整夜，医疗队收治了千余位患者。“    根据感控要求，入舱和出舱都有时间要求，注意留好余地，做好前后两班交接后，前组再有序离开……根据出入舱时间，后勤保障组尽量安排好送餐时间，保证及时、足量提供三餐。”一夜没合眼，邓玉海觉得自己仍然很精神，他在微信群里忙着交流总结经验，用他自己的话说，“这是我们筋疲力尽后的自豪”。    在新国博方舱医院奋战一周后，根据安排，邓玉海和队友们又要“开荒”去了——做好与天津援沪医疗队的交接后，他们马不停蹄奔赴虹口区纪念路方舱医院。仅用了一天时间，纪念路方舱医院1200余张床位就准备就绪。    “我觉得，医院为医疗队配备了信息协调组，是方舱医疗队组织架构的点睛之笔。”除了做好医疗救治，邓玉海还协助领队做好医疗队的各项协调指导工作。他和队友一起修订的方舱病员收治问卷，为平稳有序的开舱日打下基础；与感控员设计的感控调查问卷，为分析感控漏洞以查漏补缺提供了依据；在后方支持下，还落实了方舱医院医疗队志愿服务的章程。    对了，老邓还是位斜杠医生，闲暇之余喜欢用诗记录工作。方舱收治首夜，他写下“挥师东进方舱定，诊察三分心绪宽。饱暖无忧医有序，人命千金护万全。”又比如，他也写下了“外治法疗无症状，药食调治虑转轻。新冠执迷终不悟，扫却余毒自由行。”本报记者  郜阳,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-27/6.htm,4/27/22,第6版:上海新闻,,False
保供人  叮咚买菜广灵前置仓站长  赵闯,“许愿群”里的“奥特曼站长”,,    “想到还有人等菜下锅，我们就加快步伐。经历这轮高负荷运转，我们终将在城市这方大舞台找到自己的发光点。”    “他是‘人间奥特曼’，我又相信光了。”在叮咚买菜App的评论区，流传着广灵前置仓站长赵闯的故事，大家之所以叫他“奥特曼站长”，缘于这个“95后”的微信头像，内涵却是特殊期间的感动。一个多月来，他带领团队逆行奔跑，为大家“配送”温暖与希望。    “我晚点给你回电好吗？后台还有千余单配送。”昨天下午5时，电话那头的赵闯语速很快，他介绍，疫情前，广灵前置仓日单才800多，如今却超过6000单。几位分拣员每天像陀螺一样在分拣台边日行5万步，送菜骑手人均每天配送400多单。    晚上8时多，忙了12小时的赵闯总算有空和记者交流，他说：“特殊时期，大家盼着我们多上货、多配送，尽管很累，但作为站长，我一定要尽力保障周边居民的日常生活。”所谓“日常生活”，有吃饱与吃好两个维度。“我们附近有不少老年人，不太会手机买菜，只好打电话或微信群找我。”赵闯表示，叮咚员工没有特权，就算站长也要用手机准时抢菜，但即便再忙，他也会帮忙下单。“听说收到菜后，有位老奶奶的眼泪都在眼眶里打转。”    4月15日送出的1000多个保供蔬菜盲盒，更是广灵站的“高光时刻”。经历一段时间的“买菜难”，当时周边居民囤菜需求旺盛，叮咚买菜推出15斤重的蔬菜盲盒，很快卖光了。于是，大家都在微信群里找赵闯，一长串留言全是“想要”。“豁出去！”赵闯向公司申请补货，很快送来一卡车蔬菜盲盒，大家开足运力，一口气送到凌晨两点多。“那天下着大雨，但居民们半夜里还等着，不能辜负他们。”    随着居家日久，大家需求也从“吃饱”过渡到“吃好”，广灵站的10个“咚粉群”变成找“奥特曼站长”要小龙虾、啤酒、冰淇淋的“许愿群”。“大家有各种需求，我就去找采购，尽量满足。”赵闯说，最有成就感的一次，是帮一个小朋友买到生日蛋糕，“孩子爸爸因疫情被封控到浦东，很久没回家，想安排一份生日蛋糕。我第一时间帮他抢到，让孩子在特殊时期也吃上甜甜的蛋糕。”    这份同理心，也来自赵闯对双胞胎儿子的思念。因为工作，也因为疫情，他有一年多没回家看望父母和孩子。“特殊时期，我还是先当好大家的‘奥特曼站长’，也希望疫情早日结束，让我的兄弟们有空吃口热饭，有时间回家团圆。”    本报记者  张钰芸,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-27/7.htm,4/27/22,第7版:上海新闻,,False
好“邻居”  某房地产公司的销售人员  程景,“外来”志愿者全身心投入,,    “我只是想，与其在家躺着，还不如去做一些真正有意义的事。”    为全小区居民分发完第五批生活保障物资已经是深夜10时了。这是程景来到普陀区真如西村小区做疫情防控志愿者的第26天。程景是上海某房地产公司的销售人员，也曾是真如西村的一名普通住户。今年3月底，当得知浦西地区即将实施封控，住宅小区全部封闭管理时，他决定来这个曾经生活过的地方做志愿者。    在这个有着3200多户居民的大型社区，程景和100多位“萌新”志愿者几乎是在毫无准备的情况下上岗的。所有人都没有经验，互相之间也不认识，配合不好，状况频出。“最惨的一次，由于我负责叫号调度不够合理，有几栋楼的居民几乎同时下楼来做核酸，一时间人群‘扎堆’，当时就有好几个居民凑上来骂我。长这么大，还从没被人这么骂过，眼泪控制不住就下来了……但事后想想我能理解。”几次大规模的核酸检测后，志愿者们和居委会一起摸索着调整工作方式。4月中旬开始，小区内制定了志愿者分片区“对口”服务的工作机制。此后每一次做核酸都按南北区，分两组交叉叫号，有效避免了排长队的情况。    “最近，小区里新增阳性病例明显减少了。我最大的愿望就是守好这来之不易的成果。”程景说，“但时不时还有居民偷偷下楼溜达、倒垃圾、遛狗。我们只能不停地劝、反复跟他们讲道理。”    由于“身份”特殊，程景常常处于一种随叫随到的状态。不少居民甚至误把他当成居委会工作人员。发放抗原试剂保障物资、为高龄老人送餐、为居民配药……因为“全能”，他的工作时间比普通志愿者更长，几乎每天都要忙到凌晨1-2时。刚开始的几天他是在车上过的夜，后来居委会腾了间废弃的工作室出来给他休息。睡不到三四个小时，第二天又重新出现在需要他的点位。    “居委会的工作人员不止一次对我说，如果哪天你坚持不下去了，想回去了，我们随时给你开出门单。但我想，既然我选择了来这里，就一定要坚持到最后。等解封了，我想跟志愿者同事们一起出去吃个饭，庆祝一下。”    本报记者  解敏,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-27/8.htm,4/27/22,第8版:上海新闻,,False

,善意就是光,,    章慧敏    还记得大楼封闭前的某天，在楼道里遇到03室的爷叔，他手里提着好大一把小葱。我问他买那么多葱干吗？他说明天就是自己的生日，女儿一家三口都要来吃面，他准备烧只葱烤大排，还备了许多他们喜欢的菜品。爷叔还说，孝顺的女儿给他订了一只大蛋糕，他明天要分送给天天碰头的老伙伴和我们这层楼的邻居一起享用。    哪里想到，进屋不久，我们8号楼就接到了封闭管理的通知书，好在居民对疫情蔓延后的小区封控已有了思想准备，也就见怪不怪了。只是封控意味着足不出户，啥时做核酸，啥时垃圾出门，啥地方收快递……诸多声音的传递都得有个渠道来源啊。    我先加入了小区300人的大群，总以为有了这个群便可接收小区各路信息。可不一会儿发现不对了：8号楼已发布的一些通知如果不是06室的孙媳妇通过我们两家并排的后阳台喊话过来，我都不知晓。她问我你有没有入群啊？我说加了呀。她也纳闷了，说让我女儿看一下，你加入的是哪个群？    看着女孩触动手机键盘的手指如同珠算比赛的速度，我不由想起，十几年前我们两家搬来时女孩儿还在她妈妈的肚子里呢，转眼间已是名高中生了，怎不让人感叹时光荏苒。小女孩拉我进了新建的8号楼有近200人的临时防疫群里，“叮”，群里的七嘴八舌顿时涌入。    总以为现在的学生毫不关心与己无关的事情，其实他们的内心同样充满了善意。在这个临时群里我看到女孩虽然走不出家门，但她和长辈们一样，在为楼群出力：解答邻居的一些困惑，用英语回复外籍邻居的问题，倍觉温暖。    封闭的日子里最辛苦的无疑是志愿者。为了保证做核酸检测时每位邻居能顺利地出示二维码，他们一家一家地关照截图，为不会操作的老人代办。分发抗原试剂了，又是他们每家每户来发放并讲解要领。封控期间的干湿垃圾，又是他们统一收集……    我知道他和她都是我的邻居，可我不认识他们。敲开门分发物品时，我由衷地想说几句感激的话，但“大蓝”们哪有时间寒暄，他们有任务，而且是不能出错的任务。有序的检测需要合理的安排，什么组织楼层人员、线路布局、电梯消杀等诸多的繁杂，如果不是他们在制定方案，那一定是无序的。这种辛劳和疲惫可想而知。    一个近200人的群自然有各种品性的人，有人甚至于因为下楼做核酸时等了会儿就在群里指责志愿者。群里不是吵架之地，居民们用行动来驳斥：一句又一句对志愿者表示感谢、道声辛苦的话语接成了一条长龙。明理的都清楚在这特殊时期没有一个完美的作业是可以复制的，只有在实践中不断摸索、总结才会找到最佳方案。居民们看不得站着说话不腰疼的人！03室已近七旬的爷叔在群里一声呐喊：有需要叫一声，我们来帮忙。    前几天的一场雨，我透过窗户，看到这些居委干部、物业人员和志愿者淋着雨，把一袋袋荤素搭配的菜从大门外手提肩扛送到我们这幢29层的174户人家。这绝对是体力活，他们的身上滴着水珠，分不清是雨还是汗？    疫情折射着人心、人情，更释放着我们心中的善意。虽然我至今不认识8号楼的志愿者，或许今后我们依旧擦肩而过，没有交接，但你们是居民的定心丸，我深切感受到了。03室爷叔因为封控，蛋糕无法送来，但我深信他一定把人生中这个难忘的生日镌刻于心。疫情阻止了人们欣赏春光明媚，但有一天开门，我突然发现楼道里多了几盆绿植，那是05室夫妇从自家搬出的，这是春之绿色，春天不远了。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-28/7.htm,4/28/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,尽我所能照亮上海,,    我没想到，与上海的首次亲密接触，竟以这种特别方式开启，而且已相处近一个月。不过像我们的领队王玲护士长说的：“既来之则安之。共同抗疫，大家有必胜的信心。”    3月29日，我们安徽省岳西县中医院接到抽调人员组建安徽援沪医疗队的通知，我当即报名。31日，医疗队早晨5时出发，约9小时后到上海，陆续入住松江区酒店。收拾停当，院感专家再次对我们进行穿脱防护服及核酸采样指导，且人人过关，晚上又接受线上岗前培训。这些“战前”实训都为了让我们更好地开展工作。临睡前接到通知，第二天到静安区展开第一轮核酸检测，我们这组20人的小分队负责共和新路街道采样。    4月1日，早上5时起床，6时坐上大巴车，7时左右到达目的地，由社区工作者带领我们进入采集区域。大家各司其职，经过十多个小时连续作战，晚上6时多才完成工作，8时30分回到酒店。这天起，连续作战变成常态。    4月4日采样中，我收获许多感动。在三阳小区，一对母子结束采样后，小女孩递来两张小纸条，一张写着“谢谢”，另一张写着“Thanks”。女孩母亲说，这些词汇是孩子当天才学会的，她认真写好，送给阿姨。同样在三阳小区，一位六七十岁的老奶奶向我的同事鞠躬，说：“你们辛苦了。”那天，在乐业小区上门为市民采样时，一位90多岁退伍军人躺在床上接受核酸采样后，向我的队友敬军礼，他的夫人也鞠躬致谢。    在和诚公寓，一个小女孩将自己绘制的画送给我们。画上鲜花围绕，“大白”笑眯眯地做出胜利手势，画面上边写着“上海加油”。从这些小细节里，我们感受着上海市民的善意和暖心，似乎疲劳都没有了。    4月6日早上5时还在迷糊中，听见王玲护士长喊我们赶紧起来，今天闵行区要进行紧急采样工作，那边工作人员不够，需要我们去援助。一直忙到晚上将近7时，我们增援的两个小区，核酸采集任务圆满完成。    4月9日中午12时出发，子夜12时才结束，回宾馆已是次日凌晨1时许。12日，上海气温33℃，刘慧一组8人干到傍晚6时，因为高温，加上长时间穿防护服，刘慧中暑了。    老公每天给我打电话，都会问大概什么时候回家。我只能回答，目前还不确定，君问归期未有期啊。4月15日，援沪医疗队工作群里发布“动员令”，我和队友们都毫不犹豫报名，并签下请战书，誓要在这场没有硝烟的战场上坚持战斗，迎接最后的胜利。    从4月16日到4月27日，连续十多天的攻坚，在杨浦区的各小区、街道都留下我们安徽“大白”的身影，社区工作人员对我们工作的支持，生活的细心照顾，让我们真切地感受到“皖沪一家亲，抗疫一体化”的力量！    写到这里，我的耳边回荡起最喜欢的一首歌：“城里的月光把梦照亮，请守护她身旁……”我想，我们这些援沪医疗队队员，虽然平凡，特定时刻，仿佛也是这座大城市的月光中的一缕，尽自己的力量照亮上海、守护上海。  汪婷婷,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-28/8.htm,4/28/22,第8版:上海新闻/广告,,False

普惠城乡，让金融服务没有距离,邮储银行上海分行　多措并举助力乡村振兴,,    乡村振兴是我国“十四五”时期的重要任务之一，银行如何发挥自身优势，破解农村金融服务的难点和痛点，为乡村振兴战略的实施提供有力保障？作为国有大型商业银行，邮储银行上海分行交出了一份不错的答卷。    近年来该行始终坚持“普之城乡，惠之于民”的理念，坚守“普惠城乡，让金融服务没有距离”的使命，提供普惠金融服务，稳步构建协同支农生态，推进全面脱贫与乡村振兴有效衔接，积极履行社会责任。上海分行以推进普惠金融发展、服务实体经济为主线，聚焦新型农业主体，创新金融产品与服务，积极推进科技赋能，不断提升服务实体经济质效，加快推进三农金融服务的转型升级和高质量发展。    “贷”动农民合作社扩大生产种植规模    疫情期间，上海地区市民的“菜篮子”，除了依靠外地物资转运之外，还依靠上海本地的一些合作社。金山区支行就有着这么一群老客户，为上海的生活物资供应，默默贡献着自己的一份力量。    金山区枫泾镇的某农民专业合作社就是其中一家。该合作社成立于2015年，规划用地300亩，一期已建成160亩左右，主要以猕猴桃、赤松茸的种植为主，并与国家果树研究所建立战略合作关系。合作社在种植及规划上与现代国际农业接轨，高标准设计、精品化种植。现基地正在创建金山有机示范农业园，构建水肥一体化加互联网智能管理。合作社的日常生产主要就是供应各大商超、农贸市场、企业食堂和线上平台等。目前已成为“盒马鲜生”的种植基地，将金山区品牌“金山味道”带入盒马渠道，同时联合金山周边村民农户，通过向村民采购蔬果进行统一销售的方式，将小农户的特色瓜果带入盒马。    金山区枫泾镇重视林下经济工作，去年在枫泾镇农发办的推荐下，金山区支行得知合作社有意向承包150亩林地，用于扩大现有生产种植规模，在充分尽调合作社情况后，很快就发放240万元贷款。贷款发放后，合作社的经营收入也有了明显的提升。    疫情期间，邮储银行上海分行全力保障受疫情影响临时性资金周转困难的新型农业主体的资金需求，充分运用随借随还、无还本续贷、周转贷等服务方式为小微企业提供无缝续接支持，帮助小微企业纾解困难。    据介绍，疫情期间上海分行积极关注涉农企业的生产情况，及时为新型农业主体提供帮助，助力保障上海地区生活物资供应。    为新型农业主体提供综合性服务方案    及时为新型农业主体提供帮助的案例不胜枚举。    “截至目前，已有一批新型农业主体享受了我行推出的综合性服务方案，惠及新型农业主体100余户，其中74%的贷款笔均不足50万元，未来将让更多小微农户及新型农业主体享受到普惠信贷支持服务。通过综合服务方案，丰富生产生活场景，有效激活农村微观经济主体活力，构建邮政惠农协同生态圈。”邮储银行上海分行相关负责人表示，近年来，该行通过邮银协同，形成以邮储银行为主导，配套叠加邮政服务综合金融服务模式，为涉农主体打造了集“银行服务、保险服务、寄递服务、电商服务”于一体的金融特色综合性服务方案，切实解决农业产前、产中和产后的“融资难”“流通难”等问题，减轻了越来越多小微农户的资金包袱。    此外，邮储银行上海分行围绕新型农业主体需求，积极创新金融服务，推出特色信贷产品“邮储惠农贷”、“邮储担保贷”。2021年8月，邮储银行上海分行还正式了上线“邮储新农快贷”产品，实现新农直报平台、邮储银行上海分行和上海市中小微企业政策性融资担保基金（以下简称市农业担保基金）三个板块的线上有机串联，成为沪上首个实现三方数据交互的银行。    据介绍，邮储新农快贷主要针对资金需求在300万元以下的小型新型农业主体，创新采用批次合作模式，市农业担保基金实现“线上见单即保”，整个审核放款周期较以往缩短了一半以上。“就前期在上海松江区开展的相关试点工作来看，因其方便快捷受到客户青睐。下阶段将逐步全面推开至全市范围，惠及更多的新型农业主体。”相关负责人表示。    支持企业客户供应链流转    与金山枫泾镇合作社情况相似的是，数千里外广西和云南等地甘蔗种植农户们的产业也在金融活水的浇灌下茁长成长起来。    某集团公司下属子公司长期从事蔗糖生产和销售，需要不定期采购蔗糖来生产，其中大部分原料都是在广西、云南等甘蔗种植较多的省份进行采购。    由于跨地区的原因，该公司对于资金使用、利率价格（由于他行和异地的涉农贷款有一定的优惠政策）和贷款架构有一定的要求和难处。    在获悉相关情况后，为助力乡村振兴，支持集团子公司有更充裕的流动资金进行原材料采购，邮储银行上海分行前中后台联动为其申请利率优惠，制定专属方案，最终于今年2月成功发放流动资金贷款1亿元，用于集团子公司采购蔗糖，从实质上支持客户，支持甘蔗、蔗糖的供应链流转，这也解决了广西和云南等地甘蔗种植农户和农村的甘蔗销售问题。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/5.htm,4/29/22,第5版:专版,,False
,不让 沉默少数 被遗忘,市残联在疫情中出实招服务困难残疾人,    在疫情防控最吃劲的阶段，全市残联系统牢记“服务、代表、管理”残疾人的使命和职责，将残疾人基本生活保供和看病吃药等问题放在突出位置来抓，加强底线思维，强化底数排查，筑牢服务保障残疾人的底板，对残疾人在疫情管控期间的各类困难需求，想方设法为残疾人排忧解难，不让“沉默少数”成为被遗忘的角落。    党员干部身先士卒    积极发挥残工委作用，市残联加强与卫健委、商委和民政等成员单位的协调，建立直报沟通渠道，及时解决疫情中残疾人的急难愁盼。党员干部身先士卒，市残联党组书记及党组成员分片包干联系指导区残联在疫情防控中积极履行群众组织的职责，一名党组成员带领重要岗位部分同志24小时值守机关，部分被封控的重要岗位同志全天候居家办公，其余党员干部全部向所在社区报道，与基层干部群众并肩作战，接受居村党组织统一指挥，在疫情排查、小区封控、群众服务等工作中当先锋、作表率。    经统计，目前市残联系统党员干部社区报到人数286人，参与防疫志愿服务537人次。同时，向全市盲人协会、聋哑人协会、肢残人协会、智力残疾人及其亲友会、精神残疾人及其亲友会等各级各类残疾人专门协会发出倡议，动员全市残疾人参与和配合疫情防控，坚持正面宣传引导全市60万残疾人为实现社会面动态清零作出贡献。    兜住民生安全底线    基层残联组织与属地残疾人尤其是一户多残、以老养残、孤残、重残、独自生活无人照料残疾人等特殊困难残疾人建立疫情期间经常性联系，突出关注低保低收入家庭、急症重病患者、出行不便和新冠肺炎确诊和无症状感染者中的残疾人，形成辖区内重点关注人员名单，分发至街道、镇（乡）党委政府，建立健全相应的关心关爱机制。    针对因重残等长期居家卧床的残疾人情况，基层组织通过上门服务等方式，解决核酸检测中的出行困难。排摸滞留在盲人按摩机构或住所的盲人按摩师情况，指导全市81家盲人按摩机构业主承担起责任，保障滞留在机构的盲人按摩师正常生活，同时协调属地通过应急特需专用通道，尽力给予生活物资保供服务帮助。组织饿了么、美团、京东、盒马等电商平台企业，为残疾人搭建绿色通道优先保供。    积极发挥市残疾人福利基金会的济困助残作用，积极动员爱心企业捐款捐物，4月8日由上海喜士多便利连锁有限公司捐赠的1000多盒明治鲜牛奶已送到悦苗残疾人寄养院，后续还将送到本市部分社区的重残和一户多残家庭。目前基金会还在联系企业捐款一批防疫物资和生活用品，给奋战在一线的残疾人工作者提供防护，保障安全。    协调解决特殊困难，如确保上海市疫情防控新闻发布会的手语直播不间断，协调解决封控期间导盲犬室内排便难、护理用品断供、患有尿毒症残疾人需要进行血透治疗等难题，帮助重残人员购买或发放生活物资，协助相关部门安排新冠肺炎确诊和无症状感染者中的残疾人尽快转运等。针对“三阳机构”关闭线下服务情况，借助“上海市心理热线”等平台资源，通过电话、微信等方式关心服务对象的居家情况，为其提供心理疏导，安抚情绪、消除顾虑。    畅通民生反映渠道    凡涉及防疫工作的残疾人诉求，按“第一时间向上级报告、第一时间交属地办理、第一时间向信访人反馈”的原则办理，对残疾人来电来信采取“先行办理、后补工单”的办法，保证处置效率。    市残联向社会公布24小时信访咨询电话12385、63211941，全天候均有专人值守。同时，各区残联建立并向社会公布24小时值守的信访咨询电话。公布12345市民服务热线手语视频电话，方便听语残疾人求助。全市残联建立“一小时”残疾人疫情信息报告制度，凡是辖区内的残疾人因新冠肺炎确诊等原因被隔离的，各区残联接到报告后，第一时间协调力量帮助解决困难，并在一小时内报告市残联。    下一步，市残联将继续坚决贯彻落实市委关于疫情防控的工作部署，持续体现残疾人工作者的责任和担当。加强对新冠肺炎确诊和无症状感染者中的残疾人在隔离救治中遭遇沟通、照料等困难的预判，抓紧制定工作预案或工作指引。加强与属地党委政府、电商平台等沟通协商，加大对残疾人主副食品、必要药品、辅助器具等保供保障力度，确保残疾人基本生活。加强对一户多残、以老养残、孤残、重残、独自生活无人照料残疾人等特殊困难残疾人的主动关心，想方设法解决他们的基本生活困难。加强对抗击疫情的正面宣传报道，在及时响应残疾人群体关切的同时，对疫情期间涉及残疾人的舆情做好正面引导，坚持主旋律、传播正能量。孙云,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/6.htm,4/29/22,第6版:专版,,False
,愿每个人找到自己的心流,,    孙雯    自从2020年新冠疫情暴发以来，多了很多读书和思考的时间。线上线下、古今中外的书，我都找来看。读书的确是一件令人非常愉悦的事情，因为有很多地方、很多人文、很多时代，你是不可能一一走过的，他们的这些记录或者文字，能把你带到这样一种环境、一种想象当中。    心流这个概念，是我在参加国际足联的培训课上听到的。最早，来自于美国心理学家写的一本关于积极心理学的著作《心流》，其中很重要的一个论述是，在人类进步和繁衍的过程中，人类不仅仅有为了自然选择的一些生理需要，也就是所谓感官的享受和快乐的需要，这当然也无可厚非，但那并不是我们的最终极目标。这些由色、味、声、香等等所带来的快乐，一定是稍纵即逝的，你还是会有一种无序感，得不到安宁，会感到焦虑。    人最高的获得感，就是沉浸在心流的体验中。当然这个体验它有很清晰的定义，就是要有明确的目标、及时的反馈、全身心全神贯注地投入、得到不断提升的掌控感、技能的成就感，最终获得一种忘我的体验。    看完以后我恍然大悟，当年很多人说，女足没有钱，又没有奖励，又苦等等，为什么能坚持下来？当时很难去跟他们解释那种极致的体验。如今，我可以很好地说明了。很多东西不是金钱能换来的，就像我们在足球的成长过程中，所有前面讲的五个步骤，都能够在足球当中获得体验，这个是因为热爱所导致的一个心流的过程。    《心流》是一本提升幸福感和效率的行动指南。它是一种自我成长的体验，选定一个目标，投入全部注意力，专注无他，不管做什么事，一旦我们体会到了做这件事带来快乐，我们就会加倍努力，正循环形成，自我成长就开始了。    如果我们能非常幸运地去获得心流的话，真的是一件很开心、很幸福的事。我觉得自己就很幸运，我希望每个人都能找到这样的心流体验，获得一种积极生活的幸福感。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/7.htm,4/29/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,生活的艺术在于搭配,,"    徐芳洁    天气渐暖，适宜拈花惹草，吃春笋、蚕豆和菠菜。然而眼下，封闭居家，物资比以往紧张，土豆、洋葱等常见、易保存的食物也变得异常珍贵。    母亲每日准备三餐，家中不多的食材在她手里总能搭配出不同的花样。六点的晚饭，母亲四点半开始动手准备。不一会儿，一个个盘子里，绿色、黄色都洗干净了，切完、搭配好，静静地等待着烹饪。准备烧一个菠菜汤，无奈没有皮蛋，母亲便放了几粒虾米，汤鲜得不得了，我喝了一口，大赞：“这可真是春天的味道！”她还炖一个排骨，没有常吃的玉米，正好昨天还剩下一节藕，于是，粉藕炖排骨，一藕两吃。凉拌一盘干丝，没有香菜、胡萝卜，母亲就放了芝麻酱等调料，依然被我们吃到空盘。    我常感觉母亲有一双魔术师般的手，随心自如地搭配，不管是吃饭还是穿衣，看似随意却都自成一统。记得我很小的时候，就跟在母亲身边，看她买菜，去百货楼，不论买什么，总能找到另一个搭配的东西。过年无疑是我们小时候最期待的事情，母亲早早地给我们准备好了新衣，搭配得体，也早就准备好了过年期间的食物，庆祝一年的收获。    在慢下来的居家时间里，或许把时间放到最平常的吃饭、穿衣上，才能从内而外地感受到生活的美好与朴素，生活需要花心思去搭配、去经营，在这个过程中，我们也能寻找到生活的趣味。而这种搭配的能力是需要时间培养的，只有形成自己对于生活、对于美的感受与认识，才有可能搭配出自己的个性与味道。    这种在搭配中酝酿出的味道，或许才是生活的味道、人间的味道。当没有富足的物资时，就需要人们精打细算、统筹安排。搭配一桌饭菜，不仅需要食材，更需要的是愿意去付出的一份心思。母亲经常说：“守住灶台，就守住了一家人的幸福。”如今在疫情之下，一桌花心思搭配出来的饭菜更能抚慰人们焦躁、恐慌的心灵，就像明代李贽主张的那样，“穿衣吃饭,即是人伦物理”。    “搭配”还有另一层意思就是珍惜。母亲那代人，生活在物资比较稀缺的年代，养成了节俭的生活习惯，物尽其用，边边角角的料既能炖成一锅，也能钩成一只毛线包。    而如今，物资丰富，倘若谁在生活中节约一些水和电，节约一些剩饭和面包，反而可能招来一些疑问。也许长期以来，我们已经习惯了这种生活，食物的丰盛不可避免地造成了大量的浪费，往后的日子，我们肯定还会遇到不同形式的困难，在自然万物面前，我们一定要学会节约和珍惜，学会平等和尊重。    疫情终将会过去，我们必将取得最终的胜利，但留给我们的问题值得许多人去反思、去研究。从个体来说，一个在生活中会花心思、会搭配，又懂得节约、珍惜的人想必应该也早已参透了生活艺术的奥秘。若再遭遇类似困难时，我们必将拥有更多的经验与智慧，收拾好心情，守护好家园，打点好生活。",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-29/8.htm,4/29/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,最新“三区”划定,封控区涉及人口再减83万,"    本报讯（记者  左妍）今天上午10时，上海市举行第169场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会，市卫生健康委副主任赵丹丹、市商务委副主任周岚、市经济信息化委总工程师张宏韬出席。    市卫健委通报，4月29日，本市新增1249例新冠肺炎本土确诊病例和8932例本土无症状感染者。1249例本土确诊病例中，264例在闭环隔离管控中发现,985例为无症状感染者转归确诊病例。8932例本土无症状感染者均在闭环隔离管控中发现。截至4月29日24时，在定点医疗机构接受治疗的重型患者356例、危重型57例。    4月29日，新增本土死亡病例47例，平均年龄82.4岁，死亡的直接原因均为基础疾病。    昨天，全市本土确诊病例出院2807例，无症状感染者解除集中隔离医学观察13605例，他们将返回居住地接受健康监测，请社区妥善做好接返工作。    近期，本市聚焦重点、分区分级，对封控区、管控区、防范区实施了“核酸+抗原”的组合筛查。依据阶段性筛查结果，4月29日各区的“三区”划定结果，与4月28日相比较，全市共划分封控区15895个，涉及人口数444万人，减少人数83万人；管控区21230个，涉及人口数539万人，减少人数54万人；防范区49651个，涉及人口数1378万人，增加人数140万人。    公立医疗机构下调核酸检测费用至25元    根据市疫情防控工作领导小组办公室最新发布，本市自2022年5月1日起，将公立医疗机构开展的核酸单样本检测价格由28元下调至25元。另外，为了减轻市民和企业负担，从5月1日到6月30日，本市常态化核酸检测点实行免费核酸检测。    动态调整方舱医院设置，对患者全力救治    市卫健委副主任赵丹丹说，为实现“应收尽收”目标，上海扩大8家市级定点医院收治能力，建设32家区域性定点医院，可收治床位2.3万张。选择基础条件好、适宜改造的方舱医院加强硬件建设，提高救治能力，转换为4家“亚定点医院”，提供6700张收治床位。目前，市、区方舱医院总开放床位约30万张。    定点医院和方舱医院的床位数从开始的比较紧张，再到后来的紧平衡。据统计，近6天本市新增阳性感染者85832例，出院出舱131030例。下一步，我们将根据疫情发展进一步研判，根据分类、分级救治的原则，对定点医院、方舱医院的设置运行进行动态调整，让需要住院治疗的患者得到及时、有效的医疗救治。    保供电商大仓八成开仓，复工复市推“白名单”    市商务委副主任周岚说，截至4月29日，主要保供电商平台大仓已恢复运营56个，开仓率80%；电商平台前置仓已恢复营业862个，开仓率73.3%。全市超市卖场营业门店总数1164家，营业门店比率72.4%。各主要业态保供人员在岗61402人。    下一步，按照市委市政府要求，将出台本市商贸领域企业复工复市工作方案和疫情防控指南，建立市、区商贸领域企业复工复市“白名单”，启用“复工复市人员返岗电子通行证”。在严格落实疫情防控措施的基础上，逐步推行“线上集订集送”和“线下到店消费”服务模式，尽快恢复商业体系活力。    发放“复工证”，首批“白名单”企业复工率超80%    市经济信息化委总工程师张宏韬说，当前，在做好疫情防控的前提下，本市首批“白名单”企业复工率超过80%，日前又推出了第二批1188家“白名单”企业，有的区在此基础上也推进了一批符合条件的企业复工。    为方便重点企业人员返岗，本市在“随申办”上启用了电子“复工证”（复工复产人员返岗电子通行证）。“复工证”由相关企业向区主管部门集中申领，已发放了超过1万张“复工证”，加上有关区支持部分企业组织的集中返岗等方式，近期全市重点企业新增返岗人员超过4万人，使企业员工得到了有效补充。",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-30/7.htm,4/30/22,第7版:上海新闻,,False
,也说二餐,,    胡展奋    朋友最近多次与我激辩，缘起二餐。他自诩“二餐”了，似乎加入了什么“勋业”似的，很高光的气象，这本无不可，疫情期间根据自己的囤备而裁定餐桌之丰俭，很正常，但由此而高谈二餐的养生优越性并称“古人都是二餐的”，言外之意还是“优秀传统”，就未免矫情了，好比宅家日久皮肤白了，头发长了，就大谈“苍白的高贵性”与“蓄发的飘逸美”，有意思吗。    然而辩论一向是推动考据的，首先这个“古人”的古，“古”到什么时候呢？考证了一下，“二餐”之最古，而且成“制度”的还是殷商时代，那也未免太古了吧。甲骨文中常有“大食”与“小食”之说，据考，分别指一天中的朝、夕两餐，相当于现在的早饭晚饭，那么根据书证，殷代基本是两餐，卜辞是记载王室贵族的活动的，贵族尚且“二餐”，平民不可能有更奢侈的三餐，然而，殷人二餐，并非因为营养学上的优越性，更非“断食修炼抗疫”，而实在是“米甏里米忒少”也，彼时生产力低下，农具不是木头就是石头、骨头，比如木犁石铲骨耜，绝大多数还是人力拉犁，那地里你能指望多少产出？    《周礼·膳夫》有“王日一举”的记载。举，就是杀牲为肴，东汉郑玄解释，周王每日早饭都要开荤（杀牲）的，但中饭与晚饭则不再另杀新牲，而是吃早饭吃剩的肉食，这至少说明东周时的显贵都已一日三餐，爰至春秋战国，铁质农具的普遍应用，使生产力更为飞跃，粮食多了，遂在全社会确立了“三餐制”。    成书稍晚的《战国策》“管燕得罪齐王”章有“士三食不得厌，而君鹅鹜有余食”一语，意思是你养的鹅鸭饲料吃不完，而你的食客却一日三餐吃不饱。    显然战国时的“食客”包括孟尝君门下的冯谖都是一日三餐制的，后者“食无鱼”还不干。查《庄子·逍遥游》：“适莽苍者，三餐而反，腹犹果然”，意思是如果郊游，往返只要备好三餐之粮就不会喊饿。也说明时人皆以三餐为习。    到了汉代，人们还给一日三餐赋予了专称，早饭叫“饔”，午饭称“shang”，晚饭谓“飧”（音“孙”），《说文》“shang”，昼食也。读音与“晌”相同，专指午饭。    可见先秦以下，汉唐宋元，一日三餐的习惯早已确立而且普遍，自然这是指正常的市井社会，广大农村乃至穷乡僻壤，“二餐”还是常见的，如若乱离之世或穷苦人家，则一日能一饭尚属幸事，更遑论“三餐”“二餐”呢？朋友之论，失在“都是二餐”，未免武断了。    至于“二餐”是否具有养生的优越性则完全因人因时因地而异，我之蜜糖，焉知不是彼之砒霜？    坊间盛传，朱元璋的手里，“二餐”差点成为制度，说他即位后似乎提倡过“过午不食”，那是他出身贫苦，而且深受佛门影响的缘故，恰如他所言，“天下已平，国家无事，封赏之外，正宜俭约以省浮费，”正好提倡廉政节俭的好风气。    问题是，贫苦人只吃二餐，是为无奈，出家人只吃二餐是为修行，你朝堂之上，倡廉可以，但“廉”到一天仅二餐，简直就枉为天朝了，须知所谓早朝，就是凌晨起床，清晨4时进宫列班，因为隔夜是空腹的，很多人非但肠胃受不了，而且极易“低血糖”，上朝“启奏陛下”时必然呈半死不活状，7~8时散朝后方能进食。午时的概念是11时至13时，则午饭12时开始到翌日4时的十多个小时又必须空腹了，真有类似的规矩，不要说大臣们会隔空“喊饿”，就是他的龙子龙孙如朱棣朱权诸王以及往后的宣宗英宗武宗之类的又有几个能遵守祖训不喊饿的，故而朱元璋真有类似的旨意我也以为是“圣主乱命”——而乱命照例是应该不从的。终明一世，还不是该三餐的仍然“日食三餐”吗，在圣旨与身体之间，当然是身体更诚实啦，一个简单的道理就是，中午摄入的能量能够让你撑过慵懒的下午，穿过漫漫长夜直到翌日早晨吗，况且旧时农民晚七点一过即睡了，而你的“夜生活”晚七点才开始，还说天天上网到子夜，你当你真能“禁足日久皮肤既白，须发复长，正好枵腹大谈苍白的高贵性与蓄发的飘逸美”吗？    言甫及此，门铃骤响，朋友一个箭步冲了上去。    居委米到！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-04-30/8.htm,4/30/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

本市疫情社区传播风险得到有效遏制,六区实现社会面基本清零,,    今天上午10时，上海市举行第170场新冠疫情防控新闻发布会，市政府副秘书长、市疫情防控领导小组办公室主任顾洪辉，市卫生健康委主任邬惊雷，市商务委副主任刘敏，市公安局法制总队总队长范宏飞，市道路运输管理局副局长蔡敬艳出席，介绍疫情防控相关情况。    市政府副秘书长、市疫情防控领导小组办公室主任顾洪辉说，近一个月以来，在全国各地的齐心援助和全体市民的共同努力下，上海本轮疫情防控取得阶段性成效。当前，全市疫情形势稳中向好，清零攻坚效果日益显现。本土阳性感染者自4月13日达到单日峰值27605例后，总体呈现波动下降趋势。4月27日起，单日新增感染者数量已连续4天在1万例以下；本轮疫情的有效传播指数（实时再生数）Rt值，由此前的2.27下降到现在的0.67，已连续15天维持在1以下；核酸筛查和抗原检测的阳性检出率逐步下降。经专家综合研判，本市疫情社区传播风险已得到有效遏制。    但是，当前每天新增感染者的绝对数仍处于高位，部分老旧小区、大型企业和建筑工地等重点区域仍有疫情，全市隔离房源仍比较紧张，重症、危重症患者救治任务仍比较重，全市疫情防控成果还不稳固，稍有松懈就可能出现反弹甚至前功尽弃。    为进一步巩固扩大疫情防控成果，尽快恢复常态化防控，市防控办已制定了近期实施方案，继续从严从紧抓好应急性处置，分区分级实施差异化防控，力争尽快实现全市社会面动态清零。    结合上海超大城市实际，本市明确了社会面清零和基本清零的评价标准。即以行政区为单位，区内社会面（含管控区、防范区，以及非闭环管理的社会流动人员等）阳性感染者数量日趋减少、风险可控；如果连续三天单日新增数占区内总人口数比例小于十万分之一，就可以认为社会面基本清零；如果连续三天单日新增数为零，就实现了社会面清零。本轮疫情社会面清零之后，全市将进入常态化防控阶段。    对照上述标准，目前全市符合社会面基本清零标准的有6个区，即奉贤、金山、崇明、青浦、松江和普陀。这6个区在做好“三区”管控的同时，实施“有限人员、有限区域、有限活动”，通过全面推进十大攻坚行动，力争早日实现社会面清零的目标。    对尚未达到社会面基本清零标准的其他区域，主要是黄浦、静安、徐汇、长宁、虹口、杨浦、宝山、闵行和嘉定等9个区，继续从严从紧，实施“全域严格管理、全员检测筛查、全面流调排查、全民清洁消杀，全程查漏补缺”等综合防控措施，力争尽早实现社会面基本清零。    因为区域面积较大等原因，浦东新区将按照街镇划分，并实施相应的分区分级差异化防控措施。目前，浦东新区宣桥、泥城、大团、万祥、老港等5个镇，已符合社会面基本清零的标准。各区可以根据疫情发展和防控要求，动态调整相关措施；对与封控区、管控区毗邻并经研判具有风险的防范区，可以实施提级管控。本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-01/3.htm,5/1/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False

封控小区里，10岁生日女孩收到邻居阿姨定制版“星云蛋糕”,32层饼皮叠进多少心意,,    深邃的星空之上，升腾起一道光束，云层中，花儿若隐若现……前天是上海女孩萱萱的10岁生日，看见爸爸妈妈端着这个特别的生日蛋糕从房间一角忽然出现，萱萱惊喜地叫了起来。她原本以为，由于小区封控，自己今年生日吃不到蛋糕了。没想到，陌生的邻居阿姨用巧手满足了女孩的心愿。    深蓝的饼皮    萱萱家住闵行，从3月初以来，小区始终处于封控状态。按照上海人的习俗，10岁是“大生日”，萱妈原本想，买不到漂亮的蛋糕，自己只能赶鸭子上架，亲手做一个。在小区业主群里，萱妈求原材料和蛋糕制作方法的“求助帖”一发，邻居安妈干脆爽气“接单”。她告诉萱妈，自己女儿生日只比萱萱晚四天，两个金牛座女孩的生日蛋糕，她一并承包了。    安妈是烘焙达人，虽然家里常备各种烘焙原料，但两个月封控期间，“撸面团”成了她最好的解压方式，原料已经所剩不多。烤箱也不合时宜地闹起了脾气，做戚风蛋糕有失败的风险。究竟该如何实现女孩的心愿？安妈想到，那就做一个不用烤箱的千层蛋糕吧！    听说萱萱喜欢紫色，她用蝶豆花泡水，再兑上柠檬，调成柔和的紫色。32张饼皮一张张摊好，用慕斯圈刻成规整的圆形，再凉透，抹奶油，加上装饰，安妈从吃完晚饭一直忙碌到凌晨。然而，意外的是，天然色素在饼皮加热时产生了反应，饼皮从浅紫色变成了深蓝色。女孩会不会失望？望着这片“星空蓝”，安妈说，一瞬间，自己似乎望见苍穹。再一查，巧的是，深蓝色饼皮配着食用色素调制的薄荷绿奶油夹层，竟然和金牛座尘埃状星云有些像。这给了她灵感。她翻出“艾素糖”，制作了一块冰晶状插片，插在“星空”之上。    “它代表光，可以穿越乌云，直达穹宇。”安妈希望，在被疫情困扰的这个春天，女孩能读懂她用蛋糕所表达的祝福，“星河依旧璀璨，再灰暗的日子，也要昂首仰望！”    女儿的卡片    “这份特殊时期来自邻居的爱，就是给孩子最好的礼物。”收到这个别具匠心的生日蛋糕，萱妈颇为感慨。    看着妈妈忙前忙后，女儿安安也一起给素未谋面的小伙伴萱萱，制作了一顶糖果皇冠。    而安妈相信，成人的一言一行，都会随着时间流逝在孩子心中留下成长的印记。疫情期间，她主动报名成为了社区志愿者，是核酸检测时配合医生工作的“大白”，也是一名忙碌的“片区长”，负责几十户人家的抗原结果统计、物资发放管理等细碎工作。但每天，她仍会变魔法般，给全家变出精美三餐。给安安的小点心上，则会时不时出现一面面可爱的加油小旗帜，那是一张张用标签机打印的小纸条，“上海好起来”“再封也不疯！顶住!”    一天，临睡前，安妈意外地发现，安安不声不响为自己画了一张卡片，“亲爱的妈妈，谢谢你挺身而出当我们小区的志愿者。看到你穿上‘大白’的衣服，我感到既担心又骄傲。你在帮助别人的时候，也要保护好自己。我知道现在有很多困难，大人们都在努力解决，我也很想帮忙。我会照顾好自己的学习，也会看好胖胖（家里的老猫）。我还可以帮你煮咖啡，按摩哦！爱你的安。”本报记者  陆梓华,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-01/5.htm,5/1/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False

,向为国做奉献的劳动者致敬,,    于漪    今天是五一劳动节，我这名鲐背之年的老教师特向劳动者们、向奋斗在抗疫一线的工作者们致以衷心的节日祝贺。    在新时代，继承和弘扬劳模精神，劳动精神，工匠精神尤为重要。劳模精神是百年来，在党的领导下千千万万劳动模范舍己忘我，奋斗拼搏为建设国家造福人民而创造的极其宝贵的精神财富。人具有了这样的精神财富，脊梁骨就会挺直，心胸就会开阔，视平凡的工作为祖国伟大事业的重要有机部分，就会奉献无穷的智慧和用不完的力量。    我这个人做老师，从懵懂到成熟，就是坚持不懈地向王进喜、裔式娟、黄宝妹、包起帆等一代代劳动模范学习，从他们身上吸取宝贵的精神养料，努力自我反省，自我改造，自我提升，逐步锤炼对党的事业赤胆忠心，增强为人民服务的本领。为之，我对上海劳模、全国劳模一直怀有深深地敬意和感恩之情。    我欣喜地看到，现如今的上海有许多提供给劳模深造的平台，既引领劳模继续深造，在新长征途中发挥更加灿烂的光彩，更是切磋琢磨，理论联系实际，汇聚多方智慧，创建和弘扬中国特色劳模精神、劳动精神、工匠精神，不仅把精神转化为物质力量，而且恩泽莘莘学子，教育和激励他们健康成长，赓续红色血脉，意义重大。    劳动创造物质财富、精神财富，奋斗才有力量。时下上海的疫情，正牵动大家的心，我们要发扬奋斗、拼搏的精神，通过努力、通过劳动，克服暂时的困难。奋斗能攻坚克难，创造丰硕的学习成果，奋斗也一定能创造建设事业的辉煌，向为国做奉献的劳动者致敬。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-01/7.htm,5/1/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,丰德园,,    张旻    与年龄相适的成熟，理应包含对身边不同事物的留意，对经历过的人生“物质层面”的触摸和感悟。在我的小说里也曾出现过秋霞圃，但那只是一所背景“校园”而已，并不具有自身独立的形式意味。一些曾经隐姓埋名的奇石名筑，在我的记忆里更是几无印象。现在当我重新看到它们时，恍若隔世的感觉中，它们似乎也确乎与我无关，它们原本各具形貌，各有各的故事，未尝因某个身边过客的记忆而有所消长。    我想说的是，在个人的成长记忆中，对环境的印象大概率会出现明显的“误差”，恐怕也是我们这辈人的特征，它给我们的影响很容易会指向某些固有认知和价值观。在自己写下若干篇关于成长的小说后，如今我难免会问，如我所写，凡我所经历的，即是我所以为的和所感知的吗？当然我也还会反问，比如嘉定孔庙前，那道连接育才、仰高、兴贤三牌坊的石栏杆望柱顶部的72座古石狮子，曾经被“多此一举”加封的封套，不也是值得信以为真的吗？    如今，当我的关注点常常落在身边尚存的那些曾被“错过”的事物上时，我的目光里总还不时会流露出某种动容之情，似乎有所不忍。我曾在拙文《汇龙潭》里写过一座栉风沐雨几个世纪、40多年前从城外原古道旁迁建于此的花岗石井亭，简单的功用，讲究的用材和建造，如木作般打造出榫卯结构、歇山顶和屋脊雕刻等。在它面前，我也还会不时伸手触摸它一下，又说不出摸到什么。更不用说上述孔庙门前那72尊小石狮子和两尊大石狮子，关于它们的文字很多，每一处都会用上“栩栩如生，神态各异”。大石狮子的腿脚部位，不知被多少只手抚摸过，已变得光润如玉。这些制作不仅早已不具实用性，也已然超越观念的形态，成为一种神奇的存在：当我们伸手触摸它们时，其实宛如触摸到了历史的面容和祖先的温度。毋庸置疑，在它们诞生的年代，它们就已是巧夺天工的艺术品，可是我们并不知道它们的作者是谁。艺术品一件件完成，艺术家一个个消失了。福楼拜说过类似的话：呈显艺术，退隐艺术家。    在我的人生经历中，出发地和回归点竟都和江南园林有关，一头是旧园“秋霞圃”，另一头是曾为2019第二届长三角古典园林文化论坛圆桌对话会议现场之一的新园丰德园。曾经是懵懂学生，如今是“退隐”过客。这一命运的安排，似乎就为给我机会，弥补曾经的“错过”。不过，另一方面，我也因此幸运，常会暗自思忖，我又该如何不错过当下这番“这边独好”的人生晚景？尤其当我积累多了，懂得为精湛的传统工艺叹服时。作为今人造园的尝试，丰德园同样表现出不凡的造诣，如工艺繁复、精致华美的梅花亭顶棚构造，如气象万千、栩栩如生的砖雕影壁。有幸的是，我还能很容易地见到它们的制作者。不必说，他们都是普通“匠人”，他们也不自以为“艺术家”：在当今艺术家们的“具名”“印章”日显重要时，他们仍然只是“呈显艺术”。那么，按此逻辑，若干年后，关于这座园子，仍然没有人会知道他们。我也曾翻阅过一些古代园记，其中确实也少有关于“匠人”的记载。如果说，这是过去园记作者们的一个“疏忽”，那么毋庸讳言，它已成为今天我的一个绕不开的视点。由这个视点很容易看到一个群体，身怀绝技，默默无闻，其“前世今生”，对应的是一种本土文化生命的源远流长，是从秋霞圃、汇龙潭（孔庙）、古猗园到今人造园的生生不息。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-01/8.htm,5/1/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,小薛，挺住了！,,    小薛当居委主任，眨眼就五年了。以前天天见，胖笃笃，戴副眼镜，文文雅雅的。疫情一来，就见不到人了，只在群里见不少业主点他名，要他回答这回答那的，口气很生硬，就知道这后生日子不好过。    那天大雨滂沱，樱花大道两侧，核酸检测排成长龙。我刚测完拉上口罩，猛一抬头见小薛站在雨中，把我吓了一跳：这还是小薛吗？面黑似炭，发长如草，眼里还有血丝。在我看来，他一下子从白净书生，变成了一个风雨中的赶脚大汉！见他正哑着嗓子维持秩序，我也不便啰嗦，心想都在一个群，有话群里说吧。    可那些天，群里都是“讨伐”他的声音。逼得最紧的是：小区里的阳性病人，你为什么迟迟不转运？还有问得凶的是：核酸检测形成聚集风险，你怎么解决？    外面是凄风苦雨连夜下，网上是风刀霜剑严相逼。疫情越来越严峻，邻居们情绪也越来越激动，但小薛很久没有发声。我真想催一下他：你出来表个态啊！可他就是不出来。我替他捏了把汗。    后来邻居在群里说了公道话：“你们也要设身处地想想，居委干部也是上有老下有小的，小区封一个月，他们就在办公室住一个月；我们有床有沙发，他们只能睡地板；我们一日吃三餐，他们有一顿没一顿的。”还有邻居说：“这两天你们追着问，小薛没出声，你们知道他干什么去了？他在其他小区干一件大事，你们知不知道？”    原来，这居委要管五六个小区。某景苑街面房有个小旅馆，不知怎的，上面就把一个“中转站”落在了这里，二十多张病床，救护车载着阳性患者，在那里进进出出。这一下几百户居民不干了，嚷着要小薛说明情况、马上“拔点”。试想，能把中转站设在这里的，会是一般部门吗？而小薛这个居委主任，却是最基层的干部，他能拔掉这个点吗？    那两天，小薛焦头烂额，一天只在办公室睡两三个小时。几个小区都缠着他，上边任务又压着他，特别是某景苑居民拉着他，捶胸跳脚，要他“马上解决问题”。事到最后，小薛也豁出去了，千方百计找到分管领导，也来了个缠住不放。他想，只要认准“人民至上”“生命至上”宗旨，就是主任丢了也不足惜。最后，他果然如愿：“中转站”从居民区撤了出去……    邻居们听到这事，再遇小薛，就有了刮目相看的意思。那个“中转站”上过网，全上海都有名，他们没想到，这块硬骨头被小薛啃下了！    但小区群里，对小薛的逼问还在继续。有一天我实在看不过去，就微信他：“阳性病人转运的事，业主们催得这么紧，要不要我来助你一臂之力？”他回道：“谢谢彭老师！我们正为此举行专门会议，快了！”    果然第二天一早，邻居们见小区大门难得大开，一辆救护车闪着警灯，径直开到阳性感染者家门口停下。群里随即传开：“转运车来了！居委说，今天要运走三位病人！”    又一日，众人接到通知，说今天核酸检测，大家可以安心等在家门口，不需要再出来排队聚集。正疑惑间，四辆黄色电瓶车分头开出，每车载着两位医生，徐徐开到各家门口，一一采样。这四辆采样车，正是小薛组织人马日夜加班改成的，核酸检测的聚集风险，一下子降低不少。    居委所辖几个小区，四月底大多成了令人羡慕的“防范区”。但疫情起伏、众口难调，小薛依然处于风口浪尖。劳动节到了，抗疫正在吃劲爬坡时刻，我给这后生一句节日赠言——小薛，挺住了！    彭瑞高,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/4.htm,5/2/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,226个“暖心大礼包”送到特殊人群家,“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟携手街道、居委会等送“五一”礼物,    今天，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”融媒体平台在今日头条、抖音开设的“紧急求助热线直播”已进入第11天。连日来，不少高龄独居老人、癌症病人、残障人士等在直播中发来求助信息：自己线上不会网购、线下不会团购，虽然相关部门、街道、居委会一直给予关心，但家中生活物资还是有些“捉襟见肘”，希望更多好心人能帮帮我们。    昨天是“五一”国际劳动节，在这个特殊的日子里，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟集结出发，在公益个人、公益企业、小区志愿者、街道和居委会共同努力下，226个“暖心大礼包”送达特殊人群家中。“谢谢！谢谢！这真是雪中送炭啊！”“多亏你们了，这是我收到最好的节日礼物！”一句句感激的话语，让公益联盟小伙伴感到欣慰而踏实。    菜肉米面短缺    奶粉酸奶告急    家住闵行区古美五村的胡女士是小区志愿者，她在走访中发现小区有不少“老弱病残”，或因子女不在身边，或因缺乏生活自理能力，家中菜肉米面短缺，急需关心帮助。古美七村居委会支部书记李玲向记者表示，居委会下辖四个小区，包括古美五村、六村、七村和顾戴路115弄，共有2014户居民，其中60岁以上老人占三分之一。经初步排摸，目前约有172户特殊人群家庭需帮扶，“如果‘战疫·帮侬忙’能支援我们，那真是太好了，不少人都盼着呢！”    家住嘉定区双单路718弄永盛公寓的孙女士反映，疫情期间因丈夫值守单位，她独自一人照料一岁半的女儿。时日一长，家中米面粮油、蔬菜蛋奶濒临“断供”。虽然孙女士每天都定好闹钟抢菜，却常常“颗粒无收”；参与几次团购，又接连遭遇退单。“我少吃两口都不要紧，可家里的奶粉也快没了，宝宝饿不起啊。”    而市民袁阿婆心里最牵挂的，就是84岁的姐姐。她说，姐姐多年前由于中风瘫痪在床，牙齿不好，吞咽也有困难，只能吃酸奶、土豆泥、软面包等。小区封控后，街道和居委会配送了生活物资，但许多食物姐姐都吃不了。“我们现在最缺的就是酸奶，没有它，姐姐一日三餐都难以为继！”    需要啥就送啥    讲到一定做到    “你们需要啥，阿拉就送啥，讲到就一定做到！”在汇总核实相关信息后，“战疫·帮侬忙”融媒体平台立刻向公益联盟群发出了求助人的各项需求。一家公益企业立刻举手接单，他们迅速调配物资运力，很快就备齐了蔬菜、水果、速冻水饺和面包。“这些东西，我包下了！”一位不愿透露姓名的公益个人自掏腰包，送来了大米面条。“酸奶，我来！”“奶粉，我们来！”公益企业上海清饮贸易有限公司、公益企业光明乳业纷纷“抢单”，为袁阿婆的姐姐、孙女士1岁半的宝宝，找来了“特殊口粮”。    公益企业顺丰和途虎养车接下了“爱心接力”最后最吃重的一环——配送。第一站古美七村，昨天下午，当172个“暖心礼包”送达后，居委会支部书记李玲和志愿者们全员上阵，卸货、消杀、运送。“阿姨收到东西后，开心煞了！能帮伊拉，再辛苦也值得。”忙碌了一下午的李玲和志愿者们心里满是欣慰。    “袁阿婆拿到酸奶了”“小朋友的奶粉送到了”“静安区送达”“黄浦区送达”“长宁区送达”“虹口区送达”“杨浦区送达”“浦东新区送达”“奉贤区送达”——直到昨晚8时22分，226户特殊人群家中都收到了“五一”节的“暖心礼包”，回复电话几乎打爆了记者的手机，每一句话都是对每一位好心人的祝福与感恩。“有啥事情再来寻阿拉，阿拉一定帮忙！”这是同心抗疫者们的承诺。本报记者  房浩  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月1日11时至5月2日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求353件，其中紧急类诉求106件，已推动解决85件（含“公益联盟”11件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/5.htm,5/2/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
驰援嘉定临时隔离用房项目,85小时完成半个月工作量,,    得知自己获得2022年度全国五一劳动奖章时，上海铭富建筑安装工程有限公司电工班长黄惠冲有些意外：“我就是一个打工的，开始还以为有人在跟我开玩笑，后来祝贺我的人越来越多，我才相信了。”    在工友们眼中，黄惠冲是一名踏实、肯干、靠谱的农民工兄弟，他先后参与了上海迪士尼、上海光源二期工程等一大批市重大工程建设。今年疫情期间，他更是带领10多名班组成员，驰援嘉定临时隔离用房项目，在抢建中用苦干加巧干，解决了诸多难题，顺利完成了任务。    每一刻都是    紧急冲刺    4月7日一早，坚守在上海迪士尼工地的黄惠冲接到驰援嘉定临时隔离用房的指令，他率领突击班组火速赶往现场。面对三个区域800多套隔离板房内所有智能弱电的安装以及配合调试任务，原本半个月的工作量，留给他们的时间只有85小时。    黄惠冲绕着场地周围走了好几圈，发现室外管路错综复杂，这意味着室内铺设时必须再三小心。他主动与设计人员优化方案，将室内原有的管线重新精简编排，保证基本生活需求，也使得项目效率大幅提升。    作为上海建工安装集团的尖刀班组，黄惠冲团队参与嘉定项目最深的感触就是：每一刻都是“紧急冲刺”，每一秒都在“以不变应万变”。一间隔离板房内的弱电敷设，需要经历加装穿线盒、配管连接、线路敷设、设备终端接线安装、系统调试等多个步骤。对于黄惠冲来说，这些环节早做了上千遍，技术手法烂熟于心。“就算如此，我在铺线过程中还是很谨慎，生怕一个小环节失误导致工程延期。”    一个个难题    突如其来    一天夜里，刚完成一间隔离板房铺线的黄惠冲，收到了一名队员发出的“求助”。这名队员所在区域已铺完了线，样板房几乎可以“验收”，可在调试时线路连接出了状况，有的视频监控没电，还有的收不到信号。    黄惠冲赶到现场检查发现，由于时间紧，线号标注和设备编号对不上，且天气潮湿使得记号笔标注非常模糊，字迹难辨。“当时只能一根根归位。”黄惠冲从最里间的隔离板房开始检查，拿起寻线仪、记号笔为一根根线路重新做上标记。通过对线仪，确认每根线路的连接是否“通畅”。逐一调试后，弱电间里交换机上一个个指示灯亮起，黄惠冲知道线路都通了。    解决突如其来的难题，他都记不清多少次了。比起工作强度，黄惠冲还要帮助工友们克服害怕、担忧的心理。“班组成员在施工过程中多少有些担忧，既担心无法按时交工，也怕被感染。”黄惠冲说，他将班组分成两组轮班交叉作业，确保24小时不间断，也让大家有休息的时间。同时，施工时不断叮嘱他们戴好口罩，做好自身防护。    最终，85小时，上千条电线，原本需要半个月完成的嘉定临时隔离用房智能弱电安装工程，在黄惠冲率领的10多名电工加班加点冲刺下，顺利完成。    目前，黄惠冲和工友们已进入隔离点休整，等待下一个工作通知。电话那头的黄惠冲说：“平时忙惯了，现在让我休息，真的很不习惯。”    本报记者  裘颖琼,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/6.htm,5/2/22,第6版:综合新闻,,False
,整个世界都将为你让路,——“行走天地之中”之二十一,    俞天白    行走天地之中，总会感到，大地存在一种让整个世界都要为之让路的神圣。这种感受来自于《论自然》和《生命》享誉思想界、文学界的爱默生的一句名言：“当你坚定了自己的选择后，整个世界都将为你让路”。世界上最珍贵的是生命，当你选择了对于生命的热爱以后，世界也会为之让路！    无疑，火山是伤残大地最厉害的杀手之一。我没有目睹其暴虐，但我不止一次到过被摧残的遗迹，比如，被称为地球上最大火药桶的美国黄石公园超级火山，滇西腾冲的“热海”，海南岛的马鞍岭，长白山天池，黑龙江的五大连池等等。最教我刻骨铭心的是五大连池。那是中国唯一的活火山群，其中被称为“老黑山”的火山口，最后一次喷发是在十八世纪30年代。它喷发那一刻的肆意横行，摧毁生灵，撕裂大地的野蛮与疯狂的痕迹，依然令我心惊肉跳。这个直径300多米，深达140多米的口子，就是用无法想象的高温熔浆，轰隆隆几声，从内向外被捅开的！面对这个倒锥形的大坑，从影视中所见的火红岩浆如何奔突而出的疯狂，还会顷刻间在我眼前重现。喷发将终止，近口子的岩浆，没有喷突出去就慢慢地凝结了，被烈焰烤焦了的砂石，从四周滚落下来，和蜂窝般的火山溶液凝结物，累积成了这座陡壁。大地，也就留下了这样一个向周边展延数公里的“疤痕”：都是经过烈焰烧煅的焦黑的砂石，还有火山灰土积聚而成的“墨泥”……更多的，是流淌中的熔岩凝成的岩块，深黑色的，发着蓝光，一望无垠，其流向不相同，可以想见烈焰熊熊的岩浆肆意横行的模样，硬是将河流堰塞成了几个段落，成了相连的几口堰塞湖！    最叫人震撼的，是“石龙”所呈的景象。    “石龙”，就是指那一片因岩浆奔流而下，堰塞了石龙河而成的龙状黑色岩浆凝结坡。那是数里宽广的大空间。我们所走的道路，就是在其间开辟出来的，左右岩浆凝结成的“石海”，辽阔浩渺，波状起伏，有如犁过土地上的土垡，如柱，如碑，如坎，如陵；有的如水纹，有的如漩涡，有的如车辙，有的如麻花，有的如龙蛇，有的如牛马，有的如炊饼炉子，上尖下大，中空如竹，并由此出现了地下隧道，被辟为水帘洞和仙女宫供游客观赏……显然，烈焰喷发、岩浆奔腾、毁灭它想毁灭的那一刻，热胀冷缩，表面凝结了成了岩壳，却被下面仍在流动的熔浆撕碎了，冲破了，冲积成了如此凌乱的堆积物，200余年以后的今天，仍拒不吸收阳光，人车行走其上，气温骤增，犹如余热尚在喷发！    我的心灵，就是在彼时彼刻，被一种神圣感震撼了！这就是出现在这一片焦黑中的那许多绿色。有的岩石上，长着一些小葛蕨与圆形小叶的灌木，小家碧玉一般，如盆景；有的熔岩上，披起了青白色的苔藓，点缀着细小美丽的石花，凭它们所能，不屈地展示生命力。最令人惊叹的，是柞树、桦树，尤其是柞树，她们居然选择在经历如此浩劫的岩缝中蓬勃生长。可以想象，最初，随风而来的种子，是落在岩浆凝结物凹陷处或者狭仄的岩缝中，由灰沙积成的那一点点泥土上面的，发芽，顽强地扎下根须，努力引体向上，吸取雨露阳光，一步步，不屈不挠地将焦土覆盖，希望还给世界一片生机盎然的翠绿，就像一万年前喷发的马鞍岭那样，用葱茏生命修复得不见“伤口”！    你看，这大地，她遭受种种难以想象的凌辱与摧残，为了不失万物之母的完美与尊严，不顾火山之威，摧残之烈，毅然借助风力搬来一粒粒尘沙，年年月月，朝朝暮暮，锲而不舍修复自己，默默地去占领每一条夹缝，每一个留得住尘土的凹坑，携手随之而来的像柞树这样的每一颗带着生命的种子，还给世界以翠绿和希望，去抗拒不可抗拒的法则，于是，整个世界，就这样为她的选择让了路！眼前这一切，不就是这一自然法则的鲜活注解吗？这不禁教我想到了新冠病毒正在肆虐这一现实，两年多来，抗击这一灾难中无数可歌可泣的故事，不就是因选择了热爱生命，整个世界都为之让路的完美体现吗？病毒的每一次变种，每一次疯狂，无非只是给了这一生存法则新的诠释，新的印证，新的考验！坚定地尽自己所有与所能，为人，为己，为整个人类，热爱生命，热爱生活吧，病毒与疫情一定会为人类的神圣选择让路的！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/7.htm,5/2/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,你知道我们在想你吗,,    童自荣    1992年4月25日，这是上译人永远不会忘却的日子。三十年前的这一天，一个带领一帮配音演员创造四十余年译制片辉煌的传奇老人——这位永远躲在“幕后的幕后”的掌门人陈叙一先生与世长辞。    曾毕业于圣约翰大学、又在佐临大师的苦干剧团摸爬滚打历练过的恩师陈老头，在他生前的最后那些日子，因喉部有疾，不得已把声带割除，自嘲“从此无声”，但他依然来厂里初对间，着了迷地用手写帮着翻译做台本，此情此景，是老人留下的感人一幕。更难忘老人家弥留之际，眼已无力睁开，听觉也几近丧失，但左手指依然在下意识地动弹，那正是他在初对间里给译出的台词数口型……真是鞠躬尽瘁、死而后已啊！    三十年过去了，即便在平常的日子里，我们眼前也都会时不时地浮现陈老头兢兢业业投入工作的身影。这条清清白白、光明磊落的汉子，既不在乎名，也不在乎利，唯一在乎的就是从做本子这种创造性的劳动中获得最大快乐和幸福。今天且不说他业务上的非凡造诣，而着重讲一讲他的人品。    说来好笑，那个非常时期，从上影借调来的演员，对我们厂真是又爱又恨。爱的是可脱离牛羊棚，还可看外国影片，搞配音业务；恨的是，如同军营一般，八点一到，必须带着戏、带着嗓子进棚，红灯一亮就进入实录，而有些老兄是自由散漫惯了的，哪里受过这样的罪？不过他们很快就和我们一样习惯了，反觉得活得意气风发。这背后，首先就是因为有我们的陈老头以身作则做榜样。他如同铁人一般，每天起码提前半小时骑着“老坦克”进厂，随后就开始各部门的巡查，事必躬亲。一天、两天不难，365天天天如此，你能做到吗？    比起纪律的严格，更严格的则是对工作质量的要求。印象最深的就是“用功”二字。那接待大厅里“天天要下功夫”几个熠熠生辉的大字，时时刻刻在提醒、敦促着我们。我在译制厂三十年，从未得到过他的表扬，其他人也差不多。一句“就这样吧”，勉强算是变相的表扬，因为他的理解、感悟、判断力可谓超人，我们的配音根本达不到满分。我算是“空前”用功的，属笨鸟先飞型，连跑龙套也用功，五年龙套，我就用功了五年，这并不夸张。他都看在眼里，恰是欣赏的，所以火候一到，马上就让我尝试配主要角色，连续不断地把机会给我。而陈老头自己又是带头下功夫。我们都亲见他没日没夜做本子。那些经典影片，如《王子复仇记》《简·爱》《音乐之声》等等中的精彩对白，都可说是老厂长用他的天赋和他的生命换来的。    说到此处，立马联想到发生在他身上的那出名的段子，这个小细节若非他女儿当玩笑讲，我们还难以想象——陈老头儿因为挖掘一个绝词而心不在焉，穿着一双袜子就伸到脚盆里去洗脚，而且不止一次。一个小小的肢体动作，反映的是怎样一份伟大的襟怀啊！    在上译厂，我们的老厂长是掌握“杀生大权”的，那份配音角色名单由他一手钦定。演员安排得当，配音便成功了一半。我们心服口服，也赞叹他的艺术判断力。当然，出于培养目的，有时也担点风险，如让我配《茜茜公主》中的博克尔上校、《狐狸的故事》中的旁白。而《野麦岭》中的坏到骨子里的反派大少爷，他就不会轻易让我尝试了。坊间说，有权不用，过期作废。摆到老厂长那里就嗤之以鼻。他就像给业务把关一样，领导管理这一关的把控也同样严格，甚至更严格，小小的一点特殊化都不会沾边。他有个最钟爱的女儿，长得跟他极像，我们奇怪为何她一直待业在家。把她安排到厂里，随便哪儿找个工作，像这样的事都不用他开口，点个头就是了。但他就是不表态，也不准别人瞎起劲。一直到有了政策，可以合法地安排，这才让她来上译厂报到，去的也是个和肥缺无关的普通车间。    “一切从工作出发”是他不可动摇的信条，为此敢“犯上”。这谈何容易，不但令我们这些学生由衷地钦佩，也着实为他捏一把汗。这里是有故事的。老厂长一天天老了，由谁来接他的班，他自然早有考虑和谋略，考虑的范围也就在厂内。谁知上头硬性下了指令，老厂长也只好明确摊牌，从此后，业务上他照常出力，行政方面则决不配合。幸好没多久，事情就起了变化，老厂长当机立断，把合适的人选推上岗位。一场风波就此有惊无险地画上了句号。这个无私无畏的倔老头什么也不怕，而事实证明，他的看人和用人是完全对的。    如今上译人仍在苦苦思索，苦苦努力，期望翻译片事业再现欣欣向荣的局面。我们做学生的，愿在影迷朋友们的热切牵挂和支持下，永远追随恩师陈叙一先生，在翻译片这个阵地上战斗不息。抚今追昔，陈老头，你知道我们在想你吗？,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-02/8.htm,5/2/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

三个社会面基本清零区加快速度复工复产,包装蔬菜女工站一天腿都肿了,,    进入5月，上海六个社会面基本清零区的市民生活逐步恢复正常，区内企业复工复产“白名单”也正在迅速加长。特别是保供和防疫相关企业复工速度加快，以保障市民正常生活，加强疫情防控基本设施建设。今天上午，记者采访了青浦、金山、普陀三个社会面基本清零区的企业，了解复工复产最新情况。    青浦太来合作社    100%复工，32吨茭白妇女扛    “你看这32吨茭白，都是我们女工扛过来的，马上要运到市中心去。”今天上午，在青浦区夏阳街道太来果蔬专业合作社，理事长王印不无骄傲地对记者说。    作为一个保供企业，太来合作社如今几乎24小时运作，为中心城区和本区居民提供最需要的绿叶菜和优质蔬菜。从4月15日开始，合作社已经100%复工。    记者在现场看到，在流水线上，一捧捧不同品种的新鲜蔬菜被放到一个淡蓝色的大号马甲袋里。品种有生菜、油麦菜、茭白、菜萁、茄子、青椒，还有送的生姜、大蒜，这些都是当下市民喜闻乐见的新鲜蔬菜和绿叶菜，12斤一共60元。王印说，这个价格在全市应该算很低的了。在这个特殊的时期，企业应该拿出应有的责任担当。王印说，他现在压力很大，真切感受到市民的焦虑和迫切需求，各区镇也一直在催他送菜，不抽烟的他最近也抽上了烟。    4月30日，王印感到疫情严峻，在公司开了一个动员会，要求转入闭环运行。让他感动的是，公司48个女工全部选择了留下。最初连洗衣粉、妇女用品都没有，睡觉就在会议室里打地铺。这些女工让王印非常感动，不喊苦不喊累，一天要站十几个小时，很多人一天站下来腿都肿了。昨天进的32吨练塘茭白，都是这些女工装卸的。早上7时开始工作，一直做到深夜12时，下班后洗澡还要排一两个小时队，一天最多睡5个小时。而王印天天在包装车间办公，有时自己也去扛大包。王印说，他自己还有所有员工，都感到吃的这些苦受的这些累非常值得，能让越来越多的市民吃到新鲜满意的菜，让市民少些焦虑，他们就觉得特别有意义。本报记者  沈月明    金山枫泾镇叶聚兴粽子厂    快速恢复产能，备战端午    今天上午，记者来到位于金山区枫泾镇的叶聚兴粽子厂，在生产车间内，工人们各司其职，5名工人正在娴熟地包粽子，平均15秒就能完成一只；2名工人则在对粽子进行最后的封口及分装，准备发往上海市区。    负责人陈勋是枫泾粽子第四代传人，负责“叶聚兴”老品牌的振兴恢复工作。他介绍，粽子的生产线现在都是半自动化的，即洗米、拌米和拌料的环节都用机械操作，大大减少了人工投入。目前工厂封闭管理，4月16日刚复工时，每天只能生产3000只粽子，现在可以达9000只左右。5月对于粽子行业来说，是难得的销售旺季。往年这个时候已经在没日没夜地生产了，最高峰时一天可以生产3万只粽子，去年一年，就产出了近100万只。    “虽然受到疫情影响，但是秉承产品是核心竞争力的理念，加上前期有良好的口碑，我们还是充满信心的。”陈勋说，“目前最受市民欢迎的是五花肉粽、蛋黄粽，还有陈皮豆沙粽。我们还研发了时令系列的产品，包括竹笋粽子、梅干菜肉粽子等，希望疫情早日结束，大家可以开开心心吃粽子、过端午。”    本报记者  屠瑜  通讯员  朱丽燕    普陀施耐德工控    防疫“不掉链”，生产“不停工”    办公室里支一张行军床，虽然不如家里的床垫舒服，但上海施耐德工业控制有限公司（以下简称“施耐德工控”）的总经理乔卫新睡得很踏实。    伴随着上海实行“三区”分区分级差异化防控管理，公司近日恢复了生产线。这对乔卫新意味着新的挑战，他既要确保全公司的防疫安全“不掉链”，还得守住车间产线“不停工”。    施耐德工控生产模数化智能家居、办公用交流接触器等产品。产品除了对工业基础设备厂商意义非凡，对正在紧急建设的上海后备医疗保障设施更是意义重大。乔卫新说，作为企业的负责人，生产不能停，防疫不能松，肩上的担子很重。    施耐德工控在园区有11000平方米的工厂区域，现已有227名一线员工及工厂管理团队进行全封闭运营生产。    227名员工，生产不停工，可以保住施耐德的重要产能。“按照这样的产能及考虑到上海和周边城市的防疫控制形势，我们必须提前拉入更多原材料，这样就需要临时仓库来保障封闭生产的原材料储存。”乔卫新介绍说，而公司原本在嘉定的外仓，也早就处于封闭管理期。    “一面是生产不能停，一面是货物没有足够的储存空间”——这是封闭生产前，让乔卫新最犯难的事。未来岛园区党委书记钱世嵘了解情况后，马上给予了大力支持。从匹配园区资源，实地看场地，再到线上开会、签署临时仓储租赁合同，运送货物进仓，只用了两天。“真的太快了，还是周末，园区召集了相关负责人线上开会，签署相关文件后，当天下午就派了工作人员来帮我们打扫仓库，第二天，货物就送了进来。”乔卫新说，看见一箱箱原材料摞起来，他的心定了。本报通讯员  丁婉星  记者  江跃中,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/4.htm,5/3/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,忙起来就忘　想起来太晚,朱秋霞想和高三女儿视频有点难,    4月28日，长宁区张家宅居民区一小区突然出现“阳”，居民们炸开了锅，纷纷盯着朱秋霞不放。“我们要求一天三次消杀，要专业的！”“我们老年人多，年轻志愿者少，没人送快递怎么办？”“人数达不到团购数，物资没了怎么办？”……等她安抚好居民，想和两天没有联系的高三女儿视频，一看已是第二天凌晨1时许，只能作罢。    不放心和离不开    44岁的朱秋霞是新华路街道张家宅居民区党总支书记，从3月26日开始，就和同事们一起住在居委会。女儿马上要高考了，虽然她心里放心不下，但是居民区的防疫工作也离不开她。她说：“自己的困难自己解决，克服一下没问题的，我女儿还有人烧饭给她吃，起码饿不着，但这里有很多独居老人，没有子女在身边，只能依靠我们，太不容易了。”    张家宅居民区有9个小区，近3000人，居委会办公室设在延武机电大楼。人手不足是朱秋霞面临的最大问题。居委会有两位社工被确诊后，剩下的人都被隔离在延武机电大楼内。“我们能够照顾到大楼的居民，居民区范围大，比较分散，居委会的外围主要靠街道的下沉干部和志愿者，大家都很辛苦。”朱秋霞说。    虽然她和同事们不能出去，但是每天还是要做大量的联络沟通工作，除了居委会办公室的热线电话，朱秋霞的手机也经常被“打爆”，充个三百元钱几天就停机，后来她就一次充五百元，勉强能用半个月。有居民半夜单位送物资找她，孕妇羊水破了找她，有怨气了也会找她……    居民说要打12345投诉，朱秋霞就一直耐心地在线上和大家解释，帮他们想办法：第一，要专业的消杀是合理的，居委会想办法解决。第二，对于团购达不到人数的问题，她建议和旁边的一个小区合并采购。第三，对于快递，可以让居民寄到附近一个小店老板那，然后居委会去动员老板，帮忙解决“最后100米”。她说：“居民的心情我可以理解，我也总是尽量去帮助他们，但是有时候真的有点忙不过来，也希望居民能够理解。”    抢到一单麦当劳    每天晚上，朱秋霞尽量安排大家睡在活动室，她睡在办公室，可以随时接听电话，“我年纪最大，其他人白天做了挺多体力活，也很照顾我，晚上就尽量让他们休息好，我来最后汇总报表，处理紧急事情”。她说，基本都在凌晨二三点钟才通知白天的核酸时间，收到通知后，她还要在志愿者群里发通知后才能睡下。早上7点又要起来做准备工作，7点半就要开始测核酸，早饭常常没有时间吃，或只能随便应付一下，想和女儿视频总是“忙起来就忘，想起来太晚”！    朱秋霞通常也没有时间给家里抢菜。前几天，她正好看到有居民在线上抢麦当劳，也拿出手机随便一试，没想到给女儿抢到了一单，高兴极了。朱秋霞现在最大的心愿，就是疫情能够早点过去，早日和女儿团聚。本报记者  屠瑜,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/5.htm,5/3/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
奶粉断了一个多星期大宝小宝天天饿得直哭,紧急调运  18罐奶粉3小时送到,,    求助    我家大宝、小宝的奶粉已“断供”一个多星期。小区周边的母婴超市由于疫情封控还在停业，而网购也是一直没货。两个宝宝天天饿得直哭，真不知道该怎么办才好？    宝山区大场镇  胡女士    帮忙>>>    在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”开设的“紧急求助热线直播”现场连线中，记者了解到，胡女士家的大宝是哥哥，今年2岁；小宝是妹妹，今年1岁。“奶粉吃完后，这一个多星期，我每天只能喂他们一点稀粥硬撑着。宝宝这么小，正是长身体的时候，天天看着他们饿肚子，我心里直发疼。”言及此处，电话里传来了胡女士的抽泣声。    “帮帮宝宝！”——记者随即向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出求助信息。“这件事，我们包下了！”公益企业光明乳业迅速“接单”，一场3小时的“紧急配送”开始了。    光明乳业奶粉营销中心配送员郑旭宏即刻赶到普陀区桃浦镇的仓库。在仔细寻找后，发来信息，“婴儿配方奶粉，有货！”提上三箱奶粉，郑旭宏驾车近一个半小时，在下午3时左右，抵达胡女士所住小区。随后，志愿者经消杀后，把宝宝们的“口粮”送到了母亲手中。    在回访中，胡女士的欣喜之情溢于言表：“拿到奶粉后，我马上给宝宝们冲了两大杯，他们咕嘟咕嘟喝得可欢了！3箱18罐，够他们吃上好一阵子，这下心里踏实了！”胡女士还特地发来了宝宝的照片，在奶粉罐堆起的小山旁，可爱的他们笑得格外灿烂。    在向光明乳业配送员郑旭宏转达宝妈的谢意时，他告诉记者，考虑到两个宝宝的年龄差异，特地给他们送了二段和三段奶粉各一箱，正好满足不同需求。由于后期物流可能存在的不确定性，还多送了一  箱，让胡女士家中能多些“储备”。    据了解，疫情封控期间，光明乳业一直在努力保障婴幼儿家庭和特殊人群的生活需求。在得知浦江镇、吴泾镇、马桥镇有多个婴幼儿家庭出现奶粉短缺后，公司连夜调拨送达2000罐婴幼儿奶粉。同时，光明乳业还通过上海市残疾人福利基金会，向特殊人群捐赠了1010箱光明优加益固配方奶粉和20箱光明健能全家护益生菌。    本报记者  徐驰    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月2日11时至5月3日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求341件，其中紧急类诉求105件，已推动解决86件（含“公益联盟”17件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/6.htm,5/3/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,无轨电车老司机,,    马尚龙    一个小姑娘中学毕业，分配到了电车三场，当上了26路无轨电车的司机，每天从外滩到徐家汇，途经淮海路，开七圈半，下班。真是额骨头碰到天花板的好工作。“中学毕业分配工作”，这几个词搭配在一起，是五十年前的景象了。    小姑娘很是开心，邻舍隔壁也说她运气好，却有弄堂里老爷叔插横档进来：侬是开无轨电车啊？啊哟，无轨电车没轨道，可以乱开，叫作乱开无轨电车……老爷叔讲得起劲，小姑娘眼泪水也要落下来了：做啥瞎讲！啥人乱开无轨电车！    无疑，“乱开无轨电车”，不是一句好听的话。乱开无轨电车，是要被批评的——凡是被广泛批评的事情，也一定是广泛发生的事情。    常常是开会学习还要讨论的时候，不知不觉就说到了和主题毫无关系的零零碎碎。讲讲大道，传传小道，开开玩笑，面授摘花之招，秘传驯夫之道……无轨电车开起来，人民群众的想象力、创造力、幽默、尖刻、爽朗，火山般爆发，心旷神怡。每个人都是老司机，无轨电车总是越开越远。直至小组长拍拍台子：好刹车了！回到消灭四害的主题上来！    很多年后，我琢磨起“乱开无轨电车”的起因。最被冤枉的，不是在无轨电车上当司机的小姑娘，而是无轨电车。无轨电车得罪了谁，要承担起社会性的责任？无轨电车要是有灵性，也当是强烈要求恢复名誉的。    无轨电车生不逢时，也可以反过来说，无轨电车生而逢时。    乱开无轨电车的年代，与无轨电车在上海开始取代有轨电车的年代，不谋而合，也可以说是无轨和有轨的对接。    1960年6月1日，淮海路上有轨电车也开到了终点，由26路无轨电车替代，无轨电车成本低，票价也比汽车便宜，起步价4分，是一时的宠儿。    这“一时”，是大会小会最密集时期。里弄要开会，小组要开会，车间要开会，田头也要开会……开着开着，就开到了无主题变奏。无法考证，是谁赋予开会讨论极其形象的生命——乱开无轨电车。    这“一时”，也是社会上既热气腾腾又少章法时期。许多事情，不迷信社会定论，立志打破旧规章制度，脑袋一拍做起来。不过一做就出洋相了，老爷叔哼哼一笑：拍脑袋就是乱开无轨电车。这么一说，升华了有轨电车的意义：在上海，凡事皆有轨可行，凡事皆有规可依，不然，就是乱开无轨电车了。    无轨电车无轨，却长了两根朝天的长辫子，连接架空电线。马路上时有见到无轨电车转弯没有转好，辫子滑脱，“翘辫子”了。一阵哄笑之余，老爷叔又哼了一声，啥水平啊！乱开无轨电车——乱开无轨电车大约就是这样开出来的。    在市区有轨电车消逝后，“有轨”的概念倒是延伸了。比如“出轨”。现在这个词用得很广泛，以“出轨”来形容背离婚姻规定的延长线，很恰当。以前有轨电车四通八达的时候，也有这样的事，直白地叫作“轧姘头”，难听得没有任何讨价还价的余地。这个词极其贬义，不过当时隐忍下来的倒是比现在多。那个年代，很多人顺着年代的婚姻价值观轨道，即便出轨，多半也被教育后重新入轨，脱轨很少。    如今很少听到“乱开无轨电车”的说法了。“小组讨论”还是有，做事情不行轨不依规也还是有，但凡讨论，会场上没有乱说话的，都拿着手机在刷屏。手机不是无轨电车，又岂止是无轨电车，是飞船了。国际大事，鸡毛蒜皮，八卦传言，两性欢娱……手机是网络时代的无轨电车，不需要自己开了，乘上无轨电车，做一个吃瓜的群众，妥妥的。    那一位当年开26路无轨电车的小姑娘，几十年后退休了，仍旧是善于紧扣主题的人。朋友间说什么事情，谁要是插科打诨，她还会厉色制止：不要乱开无轨电车。不过对方笑了，她自己也笑了——她才是专业开无轨电车的。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/7.htm,5/3/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,这一抱竟成永别,——追忆黄蜀芹老师,    王悦阳    壬寅年春天尚未过去，却不曾想到离别一而再、再而三地出现。4月21日夜，著名导演黄蜀芹老师走了，享年83岁。    噩耗传来，无尽悲痛！怀念这位令人敬爱的艺术大家，作为第四代导演的杰出代表，蜀芹老师一生留下的作品数量不算最多，可影响巨大，不少都已是电影、电视历史上的经典之作。    蜀芹老师真诚、善良、勤劳、质朴，对艺术精益求精，对生活淡泊洒脱，对朋友热情大方，永难忘怀她真挚爽朗的笑容。    说来有缘，我们家和黄佐临先生三代都有交集。黄佐临先生很欣赏我父亲的舞台艺术，有一次看滑稽戏演出，结束后上台，人家跟他介绍我父亲：“这是青年滑稽演员王汝刚”，佐临先生点头微笑：“嗯，我知道，目前最好的滑稽戏演员。”父亲闻言很感动，要知道，打造中国喜剧一直是黄佐临先生的艺术梦想，他不仅亲自执导拍摄了滑稽戏电影《三毛学生意》，还曾将姚慕双、周柏春、袁一灵领衔的上海滑稽剧团，一度收编入他领导的上海人民艺术剧院，严顺开更是他发掘并培养的喜剧大家，能得到佐临先生的肯定，无疑是极高的荣誉。因此，在佐临先生担任上海戏剧白玉兰奖评委会主任时，父亲凭主演《明媒争娶》里媒婆“杨玉翠”一角获得了主角奖，奖状上就有佐临先生的亲笔签名。也因此有缘走近佐临先生，得其教诲，并与蜀芹老师相识。佐临先生去世后，家人编辑出版了《艺术大师黄佐临》一书，里面特别收录了父亲与佐临先生的合影。    因为这段缘分，使得蜀芹老师和我父亲也互相欣赏，成为好友，尽管他们没有合作过影视作品，却在一起合作了一部昆剧《琵琶行》，那是国宝级表演艺术家梁谷音老师的“封箱戏”。由于佐临先生导演过根据莎剧《麦克白》改编的昆剧《血手记》，因此梁老师想到邀请蜀芹老师做该剧导演，记得黄蜀芹老师执导时提了三点要求，第一，对于昆剧本体的写意、虚拟、程式表演，一点不动，坚决以演员表演为中心。第二，古典戏剧必须要有古典风格的演出环境，因此这部戏必须在“三山会馆”的古戏台上演出。第三，该剧有一个丑角，茶商吴一郎，希望邀请王汝刚来演。这也是我父亲第一次也是唯一一次客串演出了昆剧。    后来事实证明，黄蜀芹导演的三个要求，都为《琵琶行》演出的成功奠定了基础。特别是该剧去德国演出时，舞台上模仿“三山会馆”，搭了一个中国的古戏台，引起西方艺术界的轰动和好评。    近年来，蜀芹导演年纪大了，也几乎不再执导艺术作品，逐渐淡出了大家的视线。2007年金秋，因为杨绛先生的话剧《称心如意》在上海恢复上演，我特意去采访了她，写成了《围城情系两代缘》一文。    得知我要去采访，她非常高兴，早早在家等候，准备了自己与钱锺书、杨绛的合影，还把钱锺书先生因为电视剧《围城》而写给她的信给我看，几个小时的采访很愉快，尽管那时候她已经有些病态了，但回忆起往事时，依旧神采奕奕，唯一令我意外的一点，就是她经常说着说着就会重复说一些讲过很多遍的话，我想起来，她的母亲丹尼晚年也有类似的情况，心里不知怎的忽然难过了起来……《称心如意》在话剧艺术中心如期首演，在剧场又一次遇到蜀芹老师，她热情且亲昵地抱抱我，还用手摸摸我的头，完全把我当成一个后辈小孩，印象里，这也是我与她最后一次见面，这一拥抱，也成了永远难忘的回忆。后来我跟她的儿子郑大圣导演也合作过，还是昆曲——七夕版《长生殿》，我的文学整理，郑大圣导演，张军、沈昳丽主演。沈昳丽后来和大圣喜结良缘，成了蜀芹老师的儿媳。据说蜀芹老师最后几年身体状态并不好，大圣忙于工作，基本都是沈昳丽事无巨细地照顾着她，给她的晚年生活带来温暖与温情……舞台作因，氍毹有缘。难忘这样淡泊却真诚，整整维系了三代人的深厚情谊，如今看来，是这样珍贵且难得！现在，黄蜀芹老师走了，回忆起往事，点点滴滴涌上心头，令人感到特别难过。父亲闻讯，写下哀悼：“从混沌人间回归极乐世界，愿她一路走好！”    蜀芹老师，永不说离别！难忘您的真诚善良，也永远记得您导演的《围城》《人·鬼·情》《孽债》……岁月无情，经典不朽！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-03/8.htm,5/3/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,方舱医院夜班她们互道“节日快乐”,,    “看一看，防护是否都到位了？蹲一下检查一下气密性。”夜已深，在金山天华路方舱医院更衣区，龙华医院医疗队队员刘晟宏细心检查了“战友”张莹的防护用品穿戴，为她贴上了姓名贴。临近缓冲区，刘晟宏似乎想起了什么，冲着队友喊了声“节日快乐”，张莹一愣，忙碌的工作节奏让她无暇顾及这个属于自己的节日，挥挥手，张莹推开了门。    在天华路方舱医院，有这样一群人，她们时而穿着蓝色的隔离衣，在穿脱区像班主任一样盯着“战友”的每一步动作；时而穿上白色防护服，在方舱里为感染者带去安慰。感控护士，是医疗队里不可或缺的一员。    “曾经一起在雷神山战斗、年龄最小的她，现在成了顶梁柱。”这是护士长眼里的刘晟宏。在大家心中，这是个性格活泼开朗的东北姑娘，业务能力强，做事有条理，很放心把团队感控的重任交给了她。    “做感控护士不仅要对病人负责，更有守护我们团队的责任。”刘晟宏日常主要负责监督、指导并协助医务人员穿脱防护服，补充舱内外的防护用品，还要监督穿脱区和舱内的保洁消杀及方舱每周三次环境采样。有了武汉经验，她心里很有底气。    “想给爸爸妈妈打个电话，又怕他们担心。”小姑娘笑着说，期待患者早日治愈出院，也期待不久的将来，凯旋的那一天。    另一边，进了舱的张莹也是一刻不得闲。这是她来到天华路方舱医院的第七个夜班了，第一件事就是要通知今早需要做核酸的患者，核对信息，提醒他们截屏二维码。    紧接着，又是为病人们测量体温、心率和指脉氧，这些看似简单的操作却能快速判断患者的病情变化；用敷贴、穴位按摩等中医护理技术为患者服务，也是夜班工作的重要部分。这不，一个女病人辗转反侧，引起了张莹的注意。了解到病人失眠，向她推荐了“现代冥想辅助新冠患者康复”系列专辑，冥想治疗半小时后，关女士平复情绪，渐渐入睡了。“对了，我们还要做好患者治疗情况的记录、舱内物资的盘点，让患者的治疗和护理得到延续性的保障。”她扭头对记者说。    舱外传来了大巴车的声音——又有病人来了。张莹三步并两步，赶到收病人的入口。大巴的行李舱门离下客的中门很近，她用手托住行李舱门的一角，提醒病人们小心别磕到。有位感染者穿了“大白”来到方舱医院，张莹发现后，耐心指导他脱下……    不知不觉中，6个小时过去了。两位年轻姑娘在回驻地的大巴车上相遇了，天气渐热，刘晟宏戴着的腰托已湿透，张莹穿着的手术衣也被汗水“染”成了深色。这次轮到张莹先想起来，对着更年轻的刘晟宏道了声：节日快乐！    本报记者  郜阳,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/4.htm,5/4/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,逾十万配送寄递人员获证上岗,800多家企业上“白名单”,    本报讯（记者  张钰芸）“看，这是我的电子通行证，绿色健康码、核酸阴性报告和抗原结果一目了然。”昨天下午，叮咚买菜曹杨区域主管于国靖打开自己的随申码，点击下方图标，向记者展示其通行证。疫情期间，这已经成为配送寄递人员上岗的必要条件和通行凭证，有效防止“带疫上岗”行为的出现。    上海市商务委表示，根据全市疫情防控有关要求，近期上海已开展全市范围的配送寄递人员防疫管理专项行动，在强化“白名单”管理的基础上，上线了配送寄递人员“电子通行证”。昨日，全市配送寄递“人员白名单”人数达10.5万人。市区两级“白名单”的企业已达800多家，其中既包括美团、饿了么、盒马、叮咚买菜、京东、拼多多等电商平台，也包括邮政公司、顺丰、申通、圆通、中通、韵达等邮政、快递公司，以及在本市依法注册登记的超市卖场、餐饮企业等具有配送、寄递业务的企业。    “上岗员工必须有‘电子通行证’，我们每天都会统计信息，上报到公司。”在叮咚买菜白玉前置站，于国靖指着墙上的场所码告诉记者，员工上岗前必须扫一扫场所码，现场做一次抗原检测，同时持有“电子通行证”，才能进入站点取货并配送。而获取“电子通行证”的必要条件，是持有符合要求的核酸、抗原检测阴性证明和“健康码”绿码的“白名单”人员。如果审核不通过，“电子通行证”就会失效，该员工也会被平台叫停接单工作。    4月20日，市商务委、市邮政局发布《关于进一步加强疫情防控期间本市电商平台、邮政快递公司等配送寄递人员防疫管理的通知》，建立了涵盖电商平台、快递公司、超市卖场、餐饮企业等经营主体的“企业白名单”和配送寄递“人员白名单”。    4月22日，本市又上线了配送寄递人员“电子通行证”。经由企业报送的人员信息，通过行业主管部门审核后，再汇总报送上海市大数据中心，上海市大数据中心通过系统比对人员信息、随申码、核酸检测状况、抗原检测等信息，信息无异常人员将生成“电子通行证”。配送寄递人员开展取、送货物等工作时，要主动展示“电子通行证”、扫“场所码”，配合相关部门查验。同时及时开展核酸、抗原检测，确保“电子通行证”持续有效。    本市将强化“白名单”管理，持续推动相关企业和人员纳入“白名单”，实施动态管理，力争做到应纳尽纳、应管尽管。督导企业按照有关要求开展抗原和核酸检测，确保“电子通行证”及时有效。严格要求企业对检测结果异常的人员不派单、对“白名单”以外的配送寄递人员不派单。同时，采取多种技术手段，加强对“白名单”及“白名单”外的配送寄递人员的动态监测。    各区将开展常态化巡查抽查工作，加大“电子通行证”推广使用力度，组织社区加强在收发货、配送寄递各个环节查验“电子通行证”。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/5.htm,5/4/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
临港新片区内复工复产企业已达251家,这家半导体企业4月出货量创新高,,    4月以来，临港新片区重点企业迎来“复工潮”。上汽临港乘用车工厂，整车正在陆续下线；三一重机上海临港产业园总体复工率接近20%，国内订单生产量已恢复到正常时期的30%左右；上海电气临港工厂人员逐步返岗，国家重点项目开工率超50%……截至昨天，临港新片区范围内复工复产企业（含连续生产企业）达251家，全部在厂封闭生产及管理人员总数40651人，累计受理市级白名单企业申请返岗“复工证”2512人。    在新昇半导体科技公司创新中心工厂内某抛光车间，设备运行均全自动，能保证24小时不间断生产。60多名员工在现场照看设备的正常运行。自本轮疫情以来，上海地区集成电路制造、封测和设备材料生产企业采取多种闭环管理措施，最大程度保障生产正常进行。位于临港新片区的新昇半导体科技公司主要为下游芯片制造企业提供12英寸大硅片等关键原料。疫情以来，生产设备和产线24小时不停。3月28号后，研发、生产等关键岗位近700名员工在厂区内开展闭环作业。为确保正常生产，对于生产所需的重要原料，市经信委等部门给予大力支持，办理了各类“重要物资保障通行证”。4月份，新昇半导体300mm大硅片出货量达历史最高点，累计出货量近500万片。此外，存储器用硅片继续保持历史最高出货纪录。5月份，产量和销量将再创新高。    “停工32天后，临港新片区管委会把我们从困境中拉回来了！”上海旻艾半导体有限公司总经理吴晓坚说。旻艾半导体是专门从事IC测试的企业，主要为本市各个龙头IC设计公司做配套服务，停工导致的影响主要包括现金流压力、贷款合作流失等，最大的危机是客户转移，而且对于IC设计来说这样的转移往往“不可逆”。4月28日，旻艾“上海市第二批白名单”和临港新片区复工证明同时获批复；29日，旻艾21名员工进厂，正式复产。5月1日，旻艾工厂在岗员工增至40多名，并于当日纳入临港新片区“白名单”机制。    近日，临港新片区管委会根据疫情变化及时调整复工复产要求和疫情防控措施，制订“一企一方案”，配备“一企一专员”甚至“一企多专员”开展组团式服务，支持企业协调解决人员到岗、物资运输、疫情防控等问题。本报记者  杨欢,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/6.htm,5/4/22,第6版:上海新闻,,False
,天台远眺,,    王纪人    看到这个标题，有人以为我身在浙江台州市的天台山景区。这确实也是我的一个梦想。此生有幸登过这山那山的，甚至在唐古拉山口如银幕上的慢动作般走过几十米，在铁力士山经过长长的冰洞才登上山顶。但天外有天，山外还有山，天台山就属于那些我还没有去过却很期待拾遗补缺的名山之一。然而在防控新冠疫情中，浦东和浦西先后闭关了二十余天，上海犹如围城，所以我不可能冒天下之大不韪外出闯荡。与其成为他乡的流寓者，不如与两千五百万同城居民感同身受地共渡难关。    我这里说的天台，指的是所住公寓顶层的露天平台。我是三十多年前举家搬迁到这栋曾经是霞飞路上的第一高楼，其实也仅六层，平台则在七层，约有一百平方米，既可观景，也可晾晒衣服。一侧为一排储物间，另两侧则是城墙垛口造型的护栏。垛口与公寓的外立面曲体结构合为一体，形成装饰主义风格的仿法国城堡建筑。居住在此“城堡”的三十余年中，我很少光顾顶层的天台，而仅封城以来我和家人就登临了三四次。虽说在屡次核酸检测中，本楼居民一直保持阴性几连冠的纪录，可是也只能在小区过道、草坪和楼道里走走。因为实在无聊烦闷透顶，我们一家便开启了天台之旅。    电梯本来可以直达顶层，但不知为什么按钮只设定到六层，再爬十几级楼梯便可走上天台。在天台东南侧的垛口，沿淮海中路上空一路望去，近处是有鸽群来回盘旋的梧桐区老洋房，可惜已听不到鸽哨婉转的声音。中景是武康大楼，但只能看到上面几层。记得去年平安夜时，有一家阳台上爬了个模拟的圣诞老人，吸引过许多路人的眼球；再过去便是上海图书馆颇为硕大的建筑，但思想者的雕塑被遮蔽了。远景则是直冲云霄的上海中心，因为高耸，才能被远望。黄浦江上汽笛的长鸣和回声，已经许久没有听到了，过去可以传到几十里外，我一直把它听为来自或去向远方的声音。从西南侧的垛口望去，建筑物连绵如起伏的山峦。直达徐家汇的华山路，中间有一个小小的弧度，但不影响望到徐家汇商圈的一角。如果从架在平台上的铁梯再上一层，里面是大楼水箱的位置和机房。三十年前站在上面，东南西北都可眺望，可惜现在的视野大约被阻挡了一小半。    淮海中路和拓宽后的华山路，是交通十分繁忙的主干道，子夜后还可听到汽车在柏油路上疾驶而过的摩擦声，更有骑哈雷摩托和开豪车飆车而过的轰鸣声。附近不仅有徐家汇商业圈，地处五岔路口的武康大楼因成为网红地标建筑而天天人来车往川流不息，说日均有三万人次在此摆拍、抓拍、游荡和喝咖啡，已是保守的估计。它在精神方面的某种游荡功能，远超购物消费功能。但节假日人群过于密集，成为一个槽点。然而当我前几天在平台上俯瞰和远眺淮海中路和华山路时，日常车来人往的通衢大道，如被施过魔法似的变得空空荡荡，再也没有人和车经过。连往常满大街骑着助动车快进快停又快奔的快递小哥，也突然不见了踪影。这种突如其来的荒芜带来的空寂感，是颇为惊人的。我知道，这座原本生机勃勃、日夜不息的国际大都市，在执行封控的一刹那就开始不同了。    时常登楼使我想到了建安七子之一王粲的《登楼赋》。公元204年王粲久客思归，登上荆州当阳的麦城城楼，纵目四望，百感交集，写下了这篇传诵千年的名赋。此赋开宗明义说：“登兹楼以四望兮，聊假日以销忧”。可见登楼也可销忧，诚者斯言！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/7.htm,5/4/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,邻里情又回来了,,    陈建兴    疫情肆虐沪上，大家都宅家了，楼里建起了互助群，你缺菜、我送上，谁家没口罩了，邻居们纷纷送去，团菜一起接龙……搬进楼里二十多年了，楼上楼下、左邻右舍从未有过这么融洽、亲近，邻里情又回来了。    儿时的弄堂，大都居住着平民百姓，生活并不富裕，居住条件差，有的多户合用一只灶披间，一只大火表，但邻里间嘘寒问暖相互照应的生活气息很浓厚，整条弄堂像一个大家庭似的，充满着人情味。    夏日，弄堂里一些老头老太常会搬只小矮凳坐在弄堂口嘎讪胡，手中却不空闲，有的在拣菜，有的结绒线，有的则戴只红袖章当治保，一旦有陌生人进弄堂，就会盯着问：“侬寻啥人啊？”非要来人讲清门牌号头和姓名才会让他进去。    邻里间彼此的家庭情况也了如指掌。张家儿子会裁剪，李家媳妇绣花绣得赞；沈家爷叔会修脚踏车，王家女儿是厂里电工……谁家有困难上门求助，邻居绝对不会推卸。如果遇到老人半夜里发毛病，左邻右舍闻声都会出门帮忙：有的人去推黄鱼车，有的人搬来躺椅放到车上让病人躺下，有的小青年自告奋勇来踏车，朝着医院飞驰而去。    逢年过节，小小的灶披间是最忙碌的地方，你洗菜我烧饭，侬炒菜我择菜，相互谦让着，尽量为对方腾出空间来。王家泡饭在煤球炉上烧着烧着潽出来了，王阿姨却出去倒垃圾了，邻居蒋阿姨忙帮她掀开锅盖，搁上只筷子，不让泡饭再潽出来。灶披间里相互借根葱借块姜借一调羹酱油食盐麻油也是常事。谁家要炒辣椒毛豆子了，都会事先打个招呼，让怕辣的人避避开。谁家要办喜事了，邻居家有圆台面的都会主动出借，甚至台子、凳子，还有锅碗瓢盆，还帮着拣菜、洗菜、汏碗、刷锅子……    上学的孩子丢了钥匙，坐在家门口等爸妈回家，也会被邻居叫进屋里吃点心、做功课，甚至直接吃夜饭的。有什么好吃的，邻里间也会一起分享。谁家包了馄饨，总要一碗碗端给四邻尝尝味道；谁家有人过生日，也会把排骨面一一送给邻居。    端午节家家户户裹粽子，你家送赤豆粽，我家送白米粽，你家送蜜枣粽，我家送鲜肉粽，分享着各家的品种和手艺。春节前，农场和插队落户回来的儿女们带回的瓜子、花生和山芋干等相互也会送来送去。    哥在崇明农场是帮职工剃头的，每次探亲回沪，他总是不忘把理发工具一同带回来，抽空为邻居剃头。特别是春节前，弄堂里不少人都会来找哥剃头、剪发，一时间，我家门庭若市。有的人还拎着热水瓶、面盆，剃好头还要哥为他洗头，哥也是毫无怨言，乐呵呵地为大家服务。    邻居是互帮互助的好亲戚，但有时也会为一些鸡毛蒜皮的事情发生争执和纠纷。邻居诸家没打招呼便把家门口的一块弹硌路面填高了，雨水便积在了孙家门口，孙家姆妈大为不快。次日早，孙家姆妈有意把刷好的马桶放到了贴近诸家门口的地方以示“抗议”。诸家姆妈一看也不乐意了，也把她家的马桶放到了孙家马桶旁。本来两只马桶都是贴着自家门口放的，现在都到了两家的分界线上。一天，孙家姆妈见诸家的马桶越界到了自家地盘，怒从心头生，撩起一脚将马桶踢得老远。正从大饼摊买好油条回家的诸家姆妈见状也恼羞成怒，拎起孙家马桶掼到了弹硌路上，马桶盖裂成了两爿。从此，抬头不见低头见的两家大小都如同陌生人。    一个艳阳高照的日子，孙家姆妈去菜场买菜，留下儿子照看着晒霉的衣物。天有不测风云，一场暴雨顷刻降至，孙家儿子手忙脚乱地朝着自家搬东西。此时，诸家姆妈第一个跑过来帮孙家收竹竿上晾晒的衣服，接着诸家大女儿、小儿子都跑来帮忙。孙家姆妈急匆匆赶回来时，被眼前的一幕惊呆了。“仇人”变“亲人”了，孙家姆妈难为情地喃喃说：“谢谢倷一家门哦。”就此，两家的隔阂渐渐消除，两只马桶也都撤出了阵地。    弄堂虽已拆迁多年，但抚今思昔，我仍会念念不忘弄堂人的那份邻里情。但愿疫情过后的邻里情继续，继续……,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-04/8.htm,5/4/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

松江泖港镇防疫、生产两手抓，不误农时春耕忙,沪郊第一茬早稻今起插秧,,    本报讯（记者  沈月明  杨洁）今日立夏，阳光明媚，喜鹊翻飞。今天一早，松江区泖港镇胡光村2233亩水稻田一片忙碌景象，开始插秧。据了解，这是上海沪郊第一茬水稻，预计9月5日左右就可以新米上市。    记者所在的50亩水稻田两台插秧机同时运作。农民把秧板一块块装上机器，随着一声轰鸣，插秧机隆隆前进，一畴碧绿的秧苗徐徐展开。在田角翻土的胡光村农民曹轧大说，这块地属于家庭农场主，他今天是第一天下地做工。村里已经很久没有出现疫情，而且种地可等不得辰光。    据泖港镇农村农业服务中心党支部书记、副主任、高级农艺师梁荣介绍，今天种下的水稻品种为“松早香1号”，是地产优质大米品种，口感软糯，可以做糍粑，烧粥也很好。预计今天种下的水稻可在9月3日左右收割，9月5日左右即可上市，比传统意义上的国庆稻来得更早。因为所有的农民、农机操作员都是本地人，所以泖港可以做到早准备、早下田，加上育苗基地也在本区，所以今天大面积插秧可算全市最早。    眼下正是“国庆稻”育秧播种的重要时节，作为“沪上粮仓”之一的松江区，已实现社会面基本清零，在疫情防控的同时不误农时开始春耕。    截至目前，松江已完成春耕14.5万亩，完成率95.7%，略快于去年耕作进度，预计5月上旬全部完成。全区早熟品种国庆稻“松早香1号”今起插秧，常规晚稻的播种也在有序推进中。    协调人力让农民下地，畅通种子肥料等农资保供，都是春耕备耕的必要前提。在符合防疫要求的情况下，松江以镇、村为单位落实差异化防疫措施，组织人员有序投入农业生产，实行点对点闭环管理。    松江区农业技术推广中心负责人陈勇介绍，截至目前，全区种植业条线上的家庭农场、蔬菜基地、合作社等生产主体988家中已复产978家，复产率99%；已复产单位的从业人员2276人中已复工2234人，复工率98.2%。“上海市民熟悉的松江大米，仍会在国庆飘香。”,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/2.htm,5/5/22,第2版:要闻,,False
新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会,全市布局核酸采样点近9000个,构建“15分钟核酸服务圈”，4500个已开放,    今天上午10时，上海举行第174场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。上海现在正在布局一批常态化核酸检测采样点，市发展改革委副主任陈石燕介绍，各区结合自己的人口密度和功能需要，在居民社区、办公场所、企业园区、地铁站周边、交通场站等区域布局了一批便民采样点包括固定采样点、便民采样点和流动采样点，积极构建“15分钟核酸服务圈”。截至5月4日晚，全市共布局设置各类核酸采样点近9000个，其中，4500多个点位已经布设完成开放，目前已经提供核酸检测服务。    同时，市相关部门围绕采样操作、人员培训、采检匹配、医废处置等，制定出台了一系列配套制度和标准，加强对“采送检报”全流程的规范管理，努力为市民提供更便捷、更安全的采样服务和检测服务。    为了方便市民查询，近期市大数据中心在随申办平台上开发上线了“市核酸采样点一站式开放服务系统”，提供采样点信息搜索、位置导航、忙闲状态查询等服务，市民可以在随申办App、小程序上查询附近的采样点信息。后续也将根据市民朋友的意见、建议和反馈情况，对整个服务系统再做优化升级。本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/3.htm,5/5/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,夫战妇随  重唤石库门温情,,    疫情时期，有不少共赴一线的夫妻档，他们挺身而出，扛起双份责任担当。家住虹口区北外滩街道唐山新苑的奕枫和蔡铮就是这样一对抗疫夫妻。    早出晚归是常态    “又忙了一天抗疫，得空弄下晚饭……估计晚饭后还有团购物资到，要继续为人民服务。”近日，奕枫发了这么一条朋友圈。没想到，第二天，他就收到了好心邻居的“爱心投喂”，这让他很感动。    奕枫所住的楼栋在疫情期间就自发组建了近20人的志愿者队伍。“小区封控时，我看到居委人手不够，便询问是否需要帮忙。”就这样，奕枫也成为了一名志愿者。志愿服务涉及方方面面，奕枫参与了其中的8项，包括维护核酸检测秩序、发放物资、发放抗原，甚至还能为居民做些小修小补的“手艺活”。    加入志愿者团队后，奕枫变得忙碌起来，早出晚归是常态。“我一般早上8点起床，先打开手机看一下居委群是否有任务，有的话尽快洗漱一下，吃几口早饭就去上岗了。”任务多半是维护核酸检测秩序，整个小区的居民完成采样需要花费半天时间，其间奕枫和其他志愿者要不停地引导居民，“大家都排好队，相互间隔两米，准备好二维码、身份证。”诸如这样的话，他一天要说上几百遍。除此之外，奕枫每天还要协助完成一些日常性的工作。例如，从早上开始，小区会陆陆续续收到一批批团购物资，其中不乏有较难存放的生鲜食品，奕枫在群里收到消息后，会一遍又一遍地前往小区快递点，核对信息后，和志愿者们将物资送到居民家门口，“一般从上午9点开始忙，到凌晨才能休息。”临睡前，他还要在脑子里过一遍第二天要做的事情。    一个月瘦了12斤    参加志愿服务不到一个月的时间里，奕枫瘦了12斤。尽管身体上很疲惫，但看到通过志愿者们的努力，居民们从一开始不理解不配合到邻里守望相助、共渡难关，奕枫很高兴，“以前对门叫什么都不知道，但现在楼里的人融为了一家人，大家相互鼓劲，也就不觉得累了！”丈夫的辛苦，身为妻子的蔡铮都看在眼里，在妥善安排好家庭事宜后，她也毅然加入了志愿者团队，承担起协助居民采买生活必需品的“职责”。    小区群里发起团购时，经常会发生“小插曲”，蔡铮总能凭借多年的财务工作经验和擅长数据统计的优势化解矛盾。老年人不会参与接龙采买，蔡铮耐心示范操作；有的居民没看清团购信息就盲目参与团购，结果闹了“大乌龙”，蔡铮指导其取消接龙后再次重新统计。尽管工作困难重重，但蔡铮毫无怨言，“我愿意为大家服务！”    在他们的带动下，邻里间的关系更近了，谁家需求迫切、谁家物资短缺，只要她在群里一发话，居民们就主动站出来协调，让的让，给的给。蔡铮说：“疫情时期，邻里间前所未有地进入一种全新的相处模式，就像以前老上海石库门那样，彼此关照……”这也更加坚定了她做志愿者的信心，“助人也是助己，没有一个人是一座孤岛，只有携手，才能共克时艰！”    本报通讯员  张城凯  记者  袁玮,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/4.htm,5/5/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False

,7人  每日送药500单,饿了么星光耀外卖站获评“全国工人先锋号”,    在上海本轮疫情中他们组建抗疫志愿小队，帮居民配送药品等应急用品；外卖站成立联合工会，骑手意见沟通渠道更畅通……在新业态劳动中屡有创新的饿了么上海星光耀外卖站，荣获2022年度“全国工人先锋号”称号，这一殊荣首次颁给外卖站点（一共两个），星光耀外卖站就是其中之一。    疫情期间，新业态劳动者成为保供的重要力量。据饿了么上海星光耀外卖站站长吴义介绍，站点原本有四五十名骑手，自4月1日浦西实施封控管理以来，站点共有1名站长加6名骑手坚持在岗，每天从8时工作到夜间24时，并主动将服务半径从3公里扩展到5公里，为周边更多居民配送食品、药品以及生活用品等物资，每人每天平均配送100多单。其中占比最高的为团购药品订单，全站每日配送药品约500单。    面对运力紧张的问题，星光耀外卖站在饿了么总部的帮助下，与老百姓大药店、好药师大药店合作推出“社区集采+集中配送”的模式，让一家药店得以覆盖周边30个左右的社区。社区用户在饿了么平台下单后，药店会按照社区对打包药品进行分组，再由星光耀外卖站专车派送至每个社区，社区志愿者则接力完成最后100米送达。在运力吃紧的情况下，这一创新大大提高效率，更快响应更多市民需求。    在站长吴义的动员下，骑手们组成了志愿服务小队，在团购药品等服务之外，通过微信接单等方式，免费帮高血压老人买药、帮新生儿买尿不湿……接到周边居民的紧急需求后，骑手们说“能帮一个是一个”。    星光耀外卖站也是全国首家成立网约送餐员联合工会的站点。联合工会成立于2017年，入会有各项福利、保障。“我们大部分骑手都是外地来务工的，医保不在这里，大家不舍得去医院看病。”骑手岳少秋说，加入工会后能享受到很多服务，如免费体检、意外伤害保障、关爱物资等，联合工会与石泉路街道社区医院还设立了爱心驿站，免费为骑手问诊配药，还为站点发放感冒药、胃药等常见药品；骑手如果遇到擦伤，也可以去社区医院免费包扎。    如今，联合工会的会员规模超过了百人，不仅有本站点的小哥，也有周边其他站点的外卖员。    本报记者  金志刚,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/6.htm,5/5/22,第6版:综合新闻,,False
,灯光,,    梅子涵    我是分外恋光的，分外依赖。    阴雨日的白天，没有阳光，我就一定要开灯，桌上的台灯必须亮着。不是只为了阅读和写作，哪怕是在房间里兜圈子，坐在那儿发呆，也要亮。有灯光的发呆，呆得心里有涟漪，一圈一圈扩散，小鱼小虾蹿得格外活跃。平凡人不是大江大海，喜悦、忧郁都只在一个池塘般的方圆间，有小鱼小虾一圈一圈围着，拱起温情记忆，想起还有愉快去处，一秒钟地来到，一分钟地过去，就也如小鱼小虾一样，活跃许多，蹿上蹿下。日历上的内容除了年月日、节气，还可以由自己填上去，添上光亮心情，让自己飞扬。    大学毕业后，我离开从小的家，去大学宿舍区建立自己的家时，母亲问我想带走什么，我指着那盏年代已久的红罩子台灯，说：“它。”    在开往新家的车上，我一直抱着它，从城市的东头到西头。    它后来一直在我的桌上，夜晚和阴沉的白天，都亮着。    小时候我在它的光下做作业，后来被它映亮着写文学，备课写讲义，久了，灯罩旧了，乔其纱脆破，模样落魄。我就四处寻找了换，没法寻到。它是古典的中国式设计，从高档黄杨木龙身的嘴里叼出，精致的落落垂挂，哪怕有几处的光不得已由脆破的漏洞间映出，散开得有些憔悴，无法讲究，可我还是非要揿亮。它亮着，许多就都亮了。幸亏后来我的一个慈爱的伯伯帮着找到了师傅，几乎一模一样地制出了崭新的。这个伯伯是抱过婴儿时的我的，常来家做客，熟悉桌上那红的一片，不用言语，也懂我的心切。    一定有着必然性，我最早的记忆也和灯光有关。    那是很小很小的时候。从那个海岛上飞来的敌人飞机轰炸发电厂。他们已经来炸过，修复了，又来炸。他们不想让这儿的人有灯光，希望漆黑一片。那是夜晚，外祖母抱着我，对我说，毛毛，别怕。    窗外的天空有交错的探照灯光。很长的灯柱划破天空，晃来晃去，一个很小的孩子，也能觉得它亮得那么有力量，觉得安全。    一个年幼的孩子，对于黑和亮的记忆都可能很深。黑夜里的惊心，划破黑暗的光柱的镇定、有力量，年幼时不可能描述，但会成为记忆。这样的记忆也许不能说是迷人的，但是拥有了，却也迷人，是属于我的池塘里的丰富，游来游去。    后来，那些飞机被探照灯光照着追着飞走了，后来，我大概也睡着了。    探照灯光保卫了我们的生命，我的长大的权利。那时的家住得离发电厂很近，离煤气厂、自来水厂都很近。这都是那些飞机想炸的，很恶毒！    光、灯光于我，已有自动感应，自动会亮，如影相随，也洒入我的文学文字。    那一本法国文学杰作《小王子》里的男孩子，离开他的小行星后旅行到了别的几颗小行星。一颗一颗上遇到的人，他都觉得疑惑，不可思议，甚至反感。唯一觉得可以欣赏，甚至想留下住在那儿的是那个点灯人的星球。点灯人虽然没有自己的“思想”，行为机械，但是他的点灯职业毕竟意义明亮，如同升起星星，美丽地照亮了世界。虽然他的星球分外小，可是小也是世界。    这个点灯的人是小王子在小行星旅行中遇到的最有确定意义的人，具备生命逻辑，小王子想和他成为朋友。    每一个人都有自己的小池塘、小行星，待在自己的小方圆里，又和世界联系。我们这样的算作作家的人，别人以为你很有水平，其实也就是写了一些故事，讲些经历，说说心情，无论完全真实或者纯属虚构，都是会传到别人眼前和耳边的景象、声音。亮一点，暗一些，会掀动别人不同的涟漪。我只选择了讲一点明亮的人和事，它是我的哲学、美学，所以明明是很艰难的岁月，有沉重和伤痕，我在笔下的文字间都尽量一跃而过。任何年月都有晴朗的天气、暗暗的欢喜、善良的心意，我不喜欢站在乌云下，怒气冲冲地和自己走过的路途、踏出的脚印怄气，也让别人读了怄气。我决定的是：都真实，却温暖些，美好些，诗意充分些……难有大真理，但有小光亮！    光也是可以写出来的。如同谱在旋律间，画在色彩里。    我曾经去过巴黎那个小镇，踏进梵高住过的小楼，暗暗的楼梯，小小的房间，一个不大的天窗，日子贫穷，买面包的钱也不足，实在没有多少明亮。可是他却着迷地坐在麦地里画，金黄得铺天盖地！那只是他眼睛看见的印象金黄呢，还是心里原本有金黄的生长盛开？寻找光亮的角度，写出、画出光影照着的人生、世间，是文学和艺术的另一番大意义，鼓励生命和岁月，令心境明媚。    在农场当知青的那些年，日子是有些茫茫然然的。一间不大的平房宿舍，住下六七个人。一只暗弱的灯泡吊在房顶中央，透过帐子洒落到各人面前，只余下昏花了。有很少数的人，带了小小的台灯去，偷偷接上电线，亮在床头。那是违反规定的，可是领导们也不强行没收，眼开眼闭随它们亮着。那首很有浩荡之气却又唱得悠悠的歌里的词：“三百六十五里路，三百六十五日年年地度过，过一日，行一程，”不知何时是头。青年人想在床头有些亮光的小心愿被宽容地照应了。只是很容易的一点儿善意，多少个夜晚就明亮和温暖。    让床头亮着的人要光，眼开眼闭的人心里也有光。善意是光。让人光明，自己也光明，都成光明人。    恋光的何止哪一个某某人！    他们是在灯光下写信给父母，读会儿书报，梦里不会只有白天哼哧哼哧地拼力劳作……    我胆子不大，没敢带去，只是走过时总会羡慕地看一眼，心里美好得微微跳动。    现在想起那微微的跳动，依然美好，也有些伤感。    因为我每晚都是在帐子里很昏花的灯光下就着小台板读着、写着，无意地准备了未来。    昏花的灯光也是光。    所以也准备了今夜的写作。在老台灯的光下写着灯光。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/7.htm,5/5/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,问候达式常老师,,    汪正煜    撷一束阳光，在明亮的房内会显得更加灿烂，置于忧郁的角落，总带着忧郁的色彩。抗疫期间，宅在家里，每个人的豁达或阴郁一定与其心中有否阳光相关。    著名演员达式常，心中一定是充满了阳光的。退休以后，演员剧团需要演艺界前辈帮忙，他和老伙伴们招之即赴，毋需任何条件。如今疫情防控，无法外出，他依然关心社会新闻，关心剧团同事，有时还眺望窗外，拿起相机拍摄下“大白”们辛劳的感人场景。是的，年届八十的他，无法如田文中在《难忘的战斗》里那样指挥，却依然关切并坚信最后的胜利。    达式常比我年长点，但我们是同代人。大学毕业时，他主演的《年轻的一代》，激起我沸腾的热血，影片中的萧继业、林育生给了我极大启迪。其后，我也非常关注他的作品，那深沉稳健、准确细腻的表演和儒雅的风度，值得学习和仰慕。所欣的是，后来，我在两部电视剧中和他有过合作，在艺术上，向他学到不少，他是我的老师。    电视剧《上海人家》是部反映上海改革开放之初、体制改革的鸿篇巨著，刘琼、凌志浩、仲星火等影视界巨擘都出演，达式常演主角、体制改革的闯将焦宏基。我则忝列其中，演副厂长曹军，此人左右逢源、诡计多端，阻挠改革，是焦宏基的对立面。我很少演反派。第一场戏，拍曹军去焦家送甲鱼，拍马屁，为保官帽探消息。试镜时导演姚寿康就制止我：“你想演出坏蛋样子？”我点点头。他摇摇头：“真的坏蛋，表面从来不像坏蛋。情节发展，矛盾冲突中会显出他坏到极点。”又说：“你和达式常演对手戏后，会有体会。”果然，后来一场戏，我到焦宏基办公室去，说要把他小舅子调入厂里工作，也是拍马屁讨好。剧中焦宏基还不了解曹军，所以达式常说话平和自如，淳淳询问。对手戏往往会互相启发，营造出剧情需要的氛围。我受到他表演感染，演出了潇洒懂行又讲道理、掩盖住内心的卑鄙的样子。    毋庸置疑，电影是导演艺术，但离不开演员的创造。《子夜》拍摄时，傅敬恭导演约我现场去观看，有位演员问桑弧导演：“我这个镜头表演怎么样？”桑导回答：“我是导演，不会演戏！”细细琢磨才恍然其妙言。电影《谭嗣同》，因变法失败，谭嗣同被杀。当刽子手大刀砍下之前，达式常在这场戏里设计了一个镜头：断头台上突然飞来一只小虫，谭嗣同微笑着，轻轻挥手，让小虫飞离。这个细节，把谭嗣同无畏无惧，又善良正直热爱生活的内心世界，淋漓尽致地表现出来了。这个创造对我很有启迪。《上海人家》的剧情发展到后来，冶金局组建，曹军虽然进了领导班子但依然捣乱作祟，焦宏基做出决定，严厉地揭穿曹的真貌，撤销他一切职务。此刻，曹军手足无措、慌乱窝囊至极。如何表现？按戏的节奏，不可能给许多镜头。我设计了一个抽烟动作，海绵头香烟倒拿了，一点烟，咳嗽不止，一看着火的是海绵头……一个中近景把人物的内心表露无遗。    还有一场戏，曹军和原东方厂龚厂长（何麟饰演）狼狈为奸，后龚厂长因贪污事发被捕。抓捕龚的那场戏拍摄时，我要求导演给曹一个镜头，楼下面是龚戴手铐进警车，再接一个镜头仰拍推近景，曹军在楼上窗口看着。不需要做任何表情，蒙太奇镜头一组合，马上令观众明白曹是什么样的人了。这集播出后，我的邻居遇到了我，都骂道：“想不到侬演的迭个人，迭样子坏呀！”    和达式常第二次合作，我还是演反派，一个到大陆搞投机赚黑钱的港商。他演公安局侦缉队长，最后侦破案件，抓住港商审讯。审讯的戏真的在上海某看守所审讯室，我也真戴上手铐。拍戏前，他笑道：“你又做坏蛋，我们是老对手了！”我说：“这次是演罪犯了。”心里却深感，这两次学到不少。后来执导电视剧《迟开的兰花》时，朱曼芳来表扬我，我答：“谢谢大姐。”心里说，演艺上所有本事，我都是向前辈巨擘和你们学的啊，明着学或偷着学！    达式常工作敬业演艺高超，为人又热心。前些年，上影改革，初次方案较粗糙，很多人不满意又不敢明确反对。他就敢站出来为大家讲话，最后才改换了方案。这事大家都记得，上影的朋友也对我讲过。    去年，他在电视剧《光荣与梦想》中饰演张澜。张澜曾云：“人不可以不自爱，不可以不自修，不可以不自尊，不可以不自强，而断不可以自欺。”诚哉，斯言！    如今我们面临前所未有的磨难，但永远充满必胜信念。历史会记住今天，最美好的是曾经度过的时间。多少年过去了，流逝的是岁月，苍老的是回忆。谨以此文，问候上影厂的朋友们，问候达式常老师。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-05/8.htm,5/5/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,全力以赴持续推进清零攻坚,,    今天上午10时，上海举行第175场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。    市委常委、常务副市长吴清介绍说，本轮疫情发生以来，本市坚持“动态清零”总方针不动摇，落实“四应四尽”要求，采取坚决果断措施，全力以赴推进清零攻坚。目前疫情防控形势稳中向好，疫情得到有效控制。3月1日至5月5日，全市共报告本土确诊病例55131例、无症状感染者542293例，合计597424例，排查密接748239人，均在管控中；同期共报告境外输入病例632例，无症状感染者239例，合计871例。    自4月22日以来，全市疫情报告阳性感染者数量连续两周呈现下降趋势，实时再生数（Rt）连续十多天维持在1以下，阳性检出率逐步下降，核酸筛查检出感染者近日已降至5000人以内，且绝大部分在封控区和隔离人群中，目前疫情社区传播风险得到有效遏制。昨天，嘉定区达到社会面基本清零标准，全市累计7个区和浦东部分街镇社会面基本清零。但是，单日新增阳性感染者数量降幅较小，社会面仍有阳性感染者报告，存在疫情反弹的风险。重点区域、重点人群、重点环节防控任务依然艰巨，还需要持续推进清零攻坚行动。    近期本市加强资源统筹，实施清零攻坚十大行动，巩固扩大工作成效。目前，已经达到基本清零的区正全力防止疫情反弹，加快实现社会面清零。其余区域继续从严从紧，实施全域严格管理、全员检测筛查、全面流调排查、全民清洁消杀，全程查漏补缺等防控措施，尽早实现社会面清零。    5月1日至5日，累计核酸筛查4500余万人次。按照“三区”划分要求，动态梯次调整“三区”管控范围，封控区人口数下降至约235万，管控区人口数约430万，防范区人口数上升至1667万。本市坚持非必要不离沪，严格落实离沪管控措施，强化区域协查和信息推送，有效防止疫情外溢。目前，定点医院在院患者17644人，方舱医院在院患者97327人。已治愈出院481881例，占累计发现本土新冠肺炎感染者总数比例超过80%。    本市持续加大能力储备，本地隔离用房总数达12万间以上，建立市区定点医院44家，已开放救治床位2.5万张；方舱医院开放床位总数19.5万张。到5月5日，全市共布局设置各类常态化核酸采样点近9000个，其中5000多个点位已经开放运营。    下一步本市将深入学习贯彻落实习近平总书记在中央政治局常委会会议上的重要讲话精神，按照市委、市政府部署要求，毫不动摇坚持“动态清零”总方针，按照“四应四尽”要求，同步抓好降新增和防反弹两个重中之重，深化推进清零攻坚“十大行动”，坚决打赢“大上海保卫战”。本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/3.htm,5/6/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,复工复市“白名单”再扩容,,    ■在防范区，将加快推进超市卖场、便利店、生鲜蔬果、餐饮、日用商品、药店等满足市民基本生活的必备业态“应开尽开”。    ■餐饮门店通过线上外卖提供服务，防范区内美容美发、洗染等居民生活服务企业提供线上预约、线下错峰限流服务。    上海商贸领域企业复工复市有了明确方案。根据《关于加快本市商贸企业复工复市的通知》（沪肺炎防控办〔2022〕527号）精神，上海将在严格落实疫情防控措施的基础上，有力有序推进本市商贸企业复工复市，尽快恢复商业体系活力。    部分商贸企业“应复尽复”    目前什么类型的商贸企业可以优先申请复工复市？《通知》表示，在做好疫情防控措施的前提下，保障超市卖场、便利店、购物中心、电商平台、农贸市场（含批发市场、菜市场）、生鲜蔬果、餐饮、日用商品、药品流通等商贸企业的网点和节点（含配送中心、大仓、前置仓、中央厨房、食品加工中心）以及为上述企业提供城市配送服务的企业“应复尽复”。    其中，原来已经取得保供证明的企业可以转入复工复市“白名单”范围。其他商贸企业凭复工复市疫情防控和闭环管理方案向所在区商务主管部门或区防控办指定的部门提出申请，经审核同意后，纳入复工复市“白名单”。    《通知》明确，在做好疫情防控措施前提下，商贸企业的网点可开门营业，逐步推行“线上集订集送”和“线下到店消费”服务模式。餐饮门店通过线上外卖提供服务。    其中，在防范区，本市将加快推进超市卖场、便利店、生鲜蔬果、餐饮、日用商品、药店等满足市民基本生活的必备业态“应开尽开”。餐饮门店通过线上外卖提供服务，防范区内美容美发、洗染等居民生活服务企业提供线上预约、线下错峰限流服务。    返岗员工实施闭环管理    复工复市“白名单”企业可为其返岗人员及其承运企业（城市配送物流企业）的返岗人员申请“复工证”（复工复市人员返岗电子通行证）。返岗人员凭身份证、“复工证”联系所在居村委会，由居村委会核对其身份证和“复工证”并拍照保存，确认所住楼栋7天内无阳性，现场加做抗原检测阴性即可放行，并做好登记。如所在居村委会近期没有统一检测核酸，返岗人员无48小时核酸阴性证明，现场抗原检测阴性也可放行。    原则上相关人员不再返回小区居住，实施闭环管理。商贸企业需落实员工集中住宿。对新返岗员工设置2天静止期，尽可能落实独立住宿。    复工复市要求动态调整    商贸企业要把好“入场关”，做好进门查验，在经营场所门口张贴疫情防控相关提示和要求，设置“场所码”或健康核验一体机“数字哨兵”。要求入店顾客佩戴口罩，扫“场所码”或“数字哨兵”，配合测量体温且无异常后方可进店采购，确保人员信息可查询可追踪。划设进出通道，做好人员分流。合理设置经营场所顾客最大接待量。支持符合条件的商贸企业网点适当延长营业时间。    接下来，本市将根据疫情防控需要和商贸企业复工复市实际情况，适时对商贸企业复工复市相关要求和疫情防控指南作动态调整。  本报记者  张钰芸,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/4.htm,5/6/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,几百斤透析液是如何爬上5楼的,,    4月14日，徐汇区田林街道田林三四村已经封控管理了两周。晚上8时，居家办公的白领志愿者盛珑杰突然在小区500人大群里看到一条求助消息：“我姓何，有糖尿病、高血压，还是残疾人，家中只有85岁老母亲并患有乳腺癌，现我有很大的困难，我星期日有25箱透析液要搬五楼，我现在很着急，透析液对我来说很重要，一天不做就会面临生命危险，我只好求助群里好心人和志愿者能不能帮我搬上5楼。”    盛珑杰立即给求助者发去好友申请，也把截图发在了志愿者群里，很快志愿者群就有了反馈，正好有一位志愿者就是该楼栋的，可以上门询问具体情况。    600斤、按照25箱来计算的话，单箱重达24斤，需要搬上5楼，可以说是个重体力活了。更何况物流公司在门口卸货，再从小区门口运送到楼下，中间还有200米左右的路程。“多一个人多一份力”“我也来，多少能搬两箱”“或者我们多来几个？一人一层，接力上去？”志愿者们纷纷响应起来。    盛珑杰笑着告诉记者，当他看到“总共600斤，单箱24斤”时，他第一件事是摆弄起室友的哑铃，想看看24斤到底多重。此时，求助者何阿姨也通过了他的好友申请，反馈了一些具体的信息：“原来每箱中有2袋5升的透析液，如果单箱太重了，可以拆箱后运输；而且最低限度是每天需要2袋，并不需要一次性送上5楼；数量一共是23箱，25箱是手写时的笔误。”盛珑杰整理了一下新的信息，反馈到志愿者群里，并打算第二天上岗时去居委会反馈情况，让居委、志愿者们有一个统一的规划，整合力量，协调工作。    和往常不同的是，午饭后本该是众人轮班换岗、小憩一会儿的时刻，可是4月17日那天却没有一个志愿者回去休息，越来越多的志愿者赶来参与这次“600斤上5楼”的行动，当班志愿者们延长在岗时间，休息中的志愿者吃过午饭就早早赶来报到。居委门口停靠着4辆“小电驴”，是几位热心居民提供的运力。    下午2时，求助者何阿姨打来电话，透析液到了。同时也带来了另一个消息：“楼栋里有几个小伙子听说了，也来帮忙搬，你们志愿者别太辛苦了，上楼的任务交给他们吧。听说下午还有街道的物资发放，你们保留点体力，多休息一会儿。”    “人手多是好事啊，口罩戴好，注意消杀，咱们一起，一次性全给搬上去了！”“还有，跟商家协商好了，疫情期间改用小箱包装的，一箱一袋。之前是23大箱，一个月的量，现在是23个小箱子，半个月的量，这样运输上会方便很多。”当志愿者们风风火火地赶到门口接货时，发现换成了小箱，半个月透析液的重量远没有他们想象中那么难搬运，“早知道才这么一点，我们两个志愿者就可以帮她搬上去了，都不用做什么搬运方案了。”    5月1日，又一批透析液到了，盛珑杰告诉记者，小区拥有了一辆电动三轮车，“小电驴”已经换成“大三轮”。    本报通讯员  姚丽敏  记者  袁玮,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/5.htm,5/6/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
肿瘤患者走路5分钟就气喘，出小区做核酸检测、到医院来回20多公里路怎么走？,的哥接单  助老人完成化疗,,    求助    今年春节前一周，老伴被确诊为鼻咽部淋巴瘤，由于发现得早，2月中旬住院治疗，需要大小化疗总共六次，每周都要去医院。由于疫情封控，老伴原本4月7日就该做的第6次化疗，耽搁了整整两周。现在，他在家里走上5分钟路就会上气不接下气。我们最近预约了复旦大学附属肿瘤医院就诊，但由于小区封控、交通管制，这来回20多公里的路到底怎么走？！  宝山区新沪路  瞿阿姨    帮忙>>>    记者沟通后发现，老人所住小区居委会已同意开具出入证，瞿阿姨的老伴也约好了专家门诊。按照疫情防控要求，就诊必须持有24小时内的核酸检测阴性报告。“阿拉先要出门去做核酸，第二天再去医院看毛病。做核酸的地方和医院离家都蛮远的，老头子连几步路都走不动，没有车子，真是勿晓得哪能办？”电话中，瞿阿姨焦急万分。    记者立刻在“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟群发出信息，海博出租“雷锋车队”的吴文根师傅又“接单”了！吴文根师傅是“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟的第一批志愿者，之前他送过怀孕遭遇“胎停”的云女士和史女士到医院救治，也送过刚刚经历丧子之痛的母亲回到奉贤。    接单后，吴文根立刻拨通了瞿阿姨的电话，仔细记录了她和老伴的用车需求。当天上午9时，吴师傅赶到老人所住的小区，送他们去做了核酸检测。第二天早上8时30分，吴师傅又将瞿阿姨和老伴送到肿瘤医院。临走时，他还和老人约好过两天再来帮忙。“也是怕老人着急，我凌晨4时多就从家里出发了。这个时候，需要帮助的人真的很多，能帮一把是一把。”吴师傅说，家里人都很支持自己的公益志愿行动，孩子还帮我买了N95口罩和酒精棉。现如今，他们全家人都成了社区抗疫志愿者。    5月5日，记者在回访中了解到，之后的又一个连续两天，吴文根师傅仍旧先接送老两口做核酸检测，第二天又把他们送到医院就诊。目前，瞿阿姨的老伴已完成化疗，身体状况可接受下一步的放疗。“老头子的这条命算是有救了！谢谢吴师傅、谢谢居委会，真的太感谢大家了。”瞿阿姨话语激动。东方体育日报记者  梁群    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月5日11时至5月6日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求316件，其中紧急类诉求138件，已推动解决110件（含“公益联盟”16件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/6.htm,5/6/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,她一直深深地存在,——缅怀王玉梅老师,    奚美娟    在我上小学期间，曾经看过一本传播很广的电影连环画《丰收之后》。由此知道了一位叫王玉梅的演员。《丰收之后》被拍成电影之前，是由山东省话剧团公演于20世纪60年代的一出舞台剧。王玉梅老师在同名舞台剧和故事片中，都饰演了剧中主要人物赵五婶，口碑极佳。    20世纪80年代，我已经是上海人艺的一名青年演员。那时上影厂出品了一部轰动一时的电影《高山下的花环》，王玉梅老师在影片中饰演一位英雄战士的母亲，给人留下深刻的印象。    当年我读到一篇电影座谈会的报道，文章里写到谢晋导演专门赞扬王玉梅老师的表演状态，他介绍说，王玉梅在拍摄前与他谈戏，谈到“母亲”这个角色时，她说，当她听到儿子在前线牺牲的消息后，顿时觉得整个人像是“矮”了一截。王玉梅老师这种感受是很独特的，浸透了演员对角色的深刻体验和感悟，完全是用自己的心去紧紧粘连住一个血肉之躯后才能产生的独特感受。    这句话给我留下了很深刻的印象：原来真正的表演艺术家，是在用这样的态度，让一个角色诞生的。在我年轻的心里，感同身受地触摸到了一个词，并知道了什么才叫作“全身心”的投入。    我与王玉梅老师真正相交相知是在20世纪90年代。我们一起参与了电视连续剧《儿女情长》，饰演剧中的一对母女。《儿女情长》是一部现实主义的都市家庭剧，描绘了改革开放进程中，城市改造工程涉及到普通人家的切身利益，以及住房搬迁等工作给每个普通家庭带来的振荡。    王玉梅老师扮演的这位上海石库门弄堂里的妈妈，有六个子女，老伴从剧情开始不久就中风躺在床上被人照顾。众所周知，石库门弄堂的市民文化，具有鲜明的上海地域特色。《儿女情长》剧组的主创演员，除了王玉梅老师，其他几乎都是上海籍演艺人员，而妈妈这个角色又是剧中的灵魂人物，在“像不像”上海妈妈这个敏感话题上，不知当年王玉梅老师有没有感到压力。但从一个同行的角度来忖度，我想，压力肯定会有的。不过任何事情都有它的规律和个体解读。    说到这里，我想起著名编剧刘恒说过的话：“凡是敬业的人，有一个算一个，都是惯于自己给自己施加压力的主儿……”王老师无疑是一位敬业的演员，当她从山东话剧院来到上海的剧组，立刻与剧组成员融为一体，生活中与我们扮演她子女的六位演员亲密如一家。    记得当年的主场景是在上影厂的一个摄影棚里搭建的，开始进入拍摄后，玉梅老师就出手不凡，表演过程中点点滴滴的细腻老到，都融化在剧中对各个子女小家庭的操劳中。对于躺在床上需要照料的老伴，更是无微不至。我记得她还特意用碎布条编了一根粗粗长长的绳子，当作戏中的道具，一头拴在老伴的床头，一头拴在自己腰上，就怕万一自己坐下打个盹，老伴叫她听不见的时候，可以用拉绳子来唤她。    这个特殊的、又具有“这一个”人物性格特点的道具设计，我至今记忆犹新。我觉得这是一个表演专业上值得重视的艺术典型。因为影视作品中表演上海妇女，尤其是老年妇女的形象，经常会夸张地展示某些地方特点。而王玉梅老师当年的表演完全没有这方面的考量，我认为王老师塑造艺术人物的标准只有一个，那就是专业标准，她从来不会让自己拘泥于所谓“像不像”的表层解读，她没有夸张地搬弄一两句方言，或者概念性地表现一些世俗性的习惯动作，以为那样做就能解决所谓“像”上海人的问题了；她是从更高层面为观众献上了一个智慧而善良，朴实奉献的东方母亲的形象。    王玉梅老师演绎的上海妈妈，让看过《儿女情长》电视剧的观众都牵肠挂肚，众口交赞，却完全忽视了她是一位来自北方的演员。    我常常想，作为一名专业人士，我们到底要向前辈艺术家学习什么？他们身上到底有什么值得我们后辈学习的东西。显然，我在王玉梅老师身上，看到的是一位职业演员的专业精神，我所说的专业精神，实际上就是一种专业素养。每次她与我见面聊天时，无论时间长或短，我都能淡淡地感受到这种素养。    其一是学习的自觉意识。当她意识到时代在飞速发展时，她什么都想了解，什么都想学习。我们平时不在一个城市生活，和王老师见面聊天的机会当然也不算多，但每次见到王玉梅老师，不太会听到她碎碎念自己“已经老了”之类颓伤的话，她是一位自觉要融入生活洪流中去的表演艺术家。    其二是她对表演专业的痴迷而谦虚的态度。王老师多次与我说，我们是和其他职业的从业者一样的劳动者，只是职业不同，我们的不同是在于我们从事的是艺术劳动，这关乎到精神层面的创造需要，因此我们更要通过学习去看透眼前那个宽泛深层的现实世界。在这一点上，我也是深以为然的。我以为，在平凡生活中，你只有用平视的眼光来见识生活，才能透过现象看到本质，对于艺术工作者来说，看待生活要用平视而不是居高临下的视角，是异常重要的。    这个世界自古以来一直在流动，风云际会中我们也不知道一辈子要与多少人擦肩而过。然而，该留在心里的，她一直都会深深地存在：留不住的，那也只是过眼烟云，不必在意。王玉梅老师从事了一辈子的职业，是表演艺术工作者，但她用心用情为广大观众留下的艺术形象，一定会经久不衰永存于观众心中！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/7.htm,5/6/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,关于借钱,,    邬峭峰    一般来说，那个步步紧逼你的人，就是你自己。    当你难以顾及体面，将窘境告诉了有可能帮助你的人，尽管你已做好被婉拒的准备，但还是乐观了。往往，一旦向私人提出借款，会有个短暂静场，接着，尖锐气氛便陡然而至。平日用来遮遮掩掩的东西会纷纷脱落，只留下含义奥妙的对望。就像煮水铜壶那个把手，除去包裹着的层层布条，已不是平时那样了；再握，烫手到尖叫。    拒绝你的人，陆续排列成行。一般来说，真正会帮助你的那个人，假如存在，也将同样会以出乎预料的方式出现。    想象中，应该不是这样的，但这就是常态。道理简单，当你向个人申请借钱时，你多半没有足够关切到，别人对财产安全的重视，远非你料想的那么轻巧。你很惊诧，人们竟然如此不怕失去你，而只是怕失去钱。你发现，你已是一个有问题的载体了，接近你，就像接近一柄悬空的达摩克里斯之剑，令人不自在。至于你的高尚性和体面，只一个回合，就被忽略了。    有人猜测，你的请求，似有1%的不良嫌疑，为保全他的智商和财产，他宁可对你99%急需搀扶的事实不予关切，就回绝了。有人觉得，你眼下状态低劣，玷污了他社交层次的清誉，你已失去了互利价值，在通讯录里删除你，不会有利益上的负面涟漪，就回绝了。有人担心，你缺乏偿还能力，索债比借债还要头痛，凭什么你的麻烦，要转变成他人的惴惴不安，就回绝了。有人自知，眼下并没有能力出手相助，但也不愿让你知道得那么清楚，就回绝了。有人认为，你有点交浅言深，这等两难的情状本不该出现。也有人认为，你不够努力，怎么可以轻易分享他人以血汗换来的收成？这么想问题的人，过去或也求助过他人，但时过境迁。有人暗忖，若以真实的A原因拒绝你，妨碍他进一步看高自己，就找一个B理由回绝你，也哄骗了自己。当然，出于各种考虑，连回应你一下，都省略了，亦不在少数。    既然是一种请求，所有的回绝，都该被理性接受。如果你以往并不仇富，盼你依旧。事实是，他人的钱财和你们之间的情谊相比，在天平一侧，你像飘起的一只气球，鲜丽得窘迫。你一筹莫展，陷入懊恼、耻辱和慌乱。这便是对一个失误、失利、失败者的惩罚。    在我们周围，为什么不少人不太愿去体谅，甚至帮助有钱款需要的人，包括当初有过向人借钱经历的人，后来也不见得愿意将心比心地看待现时的借钱人。    人们总以为借钱人，要么是破格消费，要么在哪儿有了过失，再加上不太慎重地开口为难他人，他们是活该受到冷遇。借钱人在哪里出了问题，是一定的，但他们未必不是良人。很多人想到的是，你为什么要自愿落到这种地步呢？不应该让你在团团打转中，外加收到个严厉教训吗？    因缺钱而临危，退无可退时的接续步，越走越难看的案例，天下比比皆是，可谓底线难舞。不少缺钱者，被紧迫的态势追逼，心一横，就朝赖和骗的方向绝尘而去了。难怪人们反感借钱，后续种种不愉快的概率实在太大，简单避过，几乎成定式。    上海方言里有个老到的说法，它应是从市井百态中提炼而成的箴言。叫作：碰到事体，脚花勿要乱。大多数人都会经历命中难防的危难，人处逆境，能否守住步调不失稳，高下在此分野。有人从此下坠，有人多了一次深刻检视自己的珍贵机会，藉此起飞，也未可知。    有人说在国外，大家很少互相借钱，那主要是指中产以上。再说，发达国家用社会方式，解决了合理透支和借贷需求，比如求学、求医等款项的短缺。这些在发展中国家普遍实现，还需要或长或短的时日。    我有位老友在悉尼做过多年蓝领，他有个同事杰克逊，是流水线工人，也是厂工会主席，土生土长，单身，三十岁，英格兰裔。杰克逊主席几乎每周一，都会向我朋友借二十澳元，每周四下午发了工资就还。我觉得这样的借法，也没太大不好。杰克逊主席的信誉，让他多了利用资源的机会。朋友还说，他厂里有个股东，是早年从匈牙利来悉尼的犹太人。犹太股东曾告诉我朋友，他有三个女儿，小女儿买房向自己开口借钱，股东资助了她。他说，现在给你的这部分，将在我遗产分配中明文扣除。他对公平的把握，明明白白；同时又让孩子的居住条件，提前获得改善。    我甚至觉得有钱人把钱借给有急需的人，并非什么不好的事。囤积的财富资源，变得活泛起来并流向急需，有些琐碎的民生小问题，也多了解决渠道。只是人和人之间的信誉、契约精神会经受更多考验。    一方面，一有借贷发生，就有偿还上做得不够好的行为；一方面对需要借钱的人，体谅和尊重不够。真没必要把借钱看得那么吓人和不够尊严。真正应该重视的，应是对契约、公平、信誉和互助精神的恪守。财务上的融通，不是什么落伍的标志。向私人借钱，所谓在国外社会不盛行，是和国外社会服务体系相对完整和成熟有关的，不完全和人的精神底蕴有涉。近年来，随着我国社会的贫富差距加大、物质享用的选择丰富、金融活动的盈亏增多、无法预料的种种急需也频繁不期而至，避开向借偿刚性的机构借钱，而从私人那里获得借贷的需求，明显上升。    一个不难发现的现象是，人们对用款需求者的体恤不够，而习惯于仅仅紧盯或责难他们的失利、超前或无能。英雄辈出的时代，会有一个很大的挫败者基群，由他们托起寥若晨星的俊杰。对暂时从事商业活动等不顺者的关切，以及对他们二次冲锋的鼓励，应该算作一种人间温暖。    有机智者，或许会说，做那种把钱借给人的善人，就从你本人先开始吧。坦白说，借入和贷出这两种角色，我都做过，没什么大不了。    敬祝境遇不顺者，向好向好。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-06/8.htm,5/6/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会,上海中高考延期  高考  7月7日-9日  中考  7月11日-12日,幼儿园入园和义务教育招生细则本月下旬发布,    今天上午10时，上海市举行第176场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。    副市长陈群介绍，今年，全市将有5万多名考生参加秋季高考，11万名考生参加中考。针对考生和家长们高度关注的今年本市高考中考安排，在听取有关部门、有关专家、中学校长、高三初三年级的师生代表和学生家长代表等各方意见的基础上，根据当前疫情防控形势，经慎重研究并报教育部同意，作如下调整：本市秋季高考统考延期至7月7日-9日举行，高中学业水平等级性考试延期至6月18日-19日举行；中考延期至7月11日-12日举行，取消初中理化实验考试、外语听说测试，相关考试成绩以满分计入学生中考总成绩。    因为疫情作出以上调整，主要基于三方面考虑：一是大考之前，要尽可能给高三、初三以及参加等级考的高二学生到校学习留出必要时间。疫情过后，学生由家门直接走进考场，应考状态可能难以保证。校长和老师们普遍认为，在符合疫情防控要求的前提下，要给考生们留出一段在校学习的时间，巩固复习成效，稳定考前心态，适应考试环境，从而能以更好的状态迎接考试。二是需要在等级考和秋季统考之间留出一定的时间间隔。秋季统考比等级考权重大，两次考试之间留出一定的时间间隔，让考生在完成等级考后，再专心复习一段时间，以迎接语、数、外3门统考科目的考试，这样安排更为合理，也符合以往惯例。三是使考务安排更具操作性。中考的理化实验和外语听说测试对考场防疫要求比较高，组织难度更大，在总成绩中所占权重较低，特别是因为疫情原因，初三学生实际上无法接受理化实验训练。经综合考虑，决定今年取消这两项测试，相关成绩以满分计入中考总成绩。    市教委主任王平说，市教委将在命题、制卷、组考、评卷、招生、录取各环节切实做到“公平、安全、有序、温馨”。针对届时考生可能出现的尚在集中隔离治疗或核酸异常等特殊情况，会专设应急考点、集中隔离考点，设置不同类型专用考场，提前组建闭环转运队伍，确保“应考尽考”。接下来会动员教育系统内外的力量，做好对考生的关心和帮助，尤其是对感染新冠以及有密接隔离经历的考生、对家长奋战在抗疫一线和学习条件相对困难的考生，“一人一策”细致做好工作；优化完善应急预案，创造“应考尽考”的条件，在设立常规考点和考场基础上，根据防疫需要设立应急考点和考场。    针对大家关心的幼儿园入园和义务教育招生入学工作，和去年相比，今年政策整体稳定，细则将于本月下旬发布。本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/3.htm,5/7/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,铁路信号工变身小区“空中快递员”,,    一架写着楼栋门牌号码的小型无人机，缓缓落在小区门口。外卖员核对地址后，将一盒降压药品放在无人机的空投器上。跨越200米的距离，无人机成功降落，70多岁的邻居阿婆拿到药品后，可以用“惊喜”来形容她的心情——“喜”的是终于拿到了药品，“惊”的是平生第一次亲眼见证无人机送货。    这一幕发生在疫情封控中的上海市宝山区宝华北岸郡庭小区，而且不止一次上演。操作无人机的年轻人，名叫俞冬平，是中国铁路上海局集团有限公司上海电务段动车车载车间一名信号工。    其实用无人机运送物资的想法源于一次偶然。俞冬平所在的小区4月1日开始封控，至今还属于封控区。有一天，他一大早就接到快递小哥的电话，说他买的鸡蛋已经放在小区门口的货架上。谁知天黑时，气喘吁吁的志愿者才将物资送到他家。    “我和送物资的志愿者说话时，看到他穿着厚重的防护服，我能感觉到他们实在太辛苦了。”俞冬平所在的楼栋有阳性感染病例，看着全身“武装”、护目镜里全是汗水雾气的志愿者，他想，自己能不能做点什么，既能减少交叉感染风险，降低志愿者的劳动强度，又能提高配送效率呢？    他将目光投向了自己的无人机上。那是他去年购买的一台适合航拍的便携式无人机，负重能到3公斤左右，加之他所在的小区为“非禁飞区”，一个用无人机代为“跑腿”的想法随即形成。    过了几天，俞冬平买的牙膏到货了，于是他开始尝试用无人机取货。无人机顺利飞到小区门口，在和快递小哥沟通好后，牙膏被固定在空投器上，他操纵着无人机开始“返航任务”。很快，“首飞”成功了！随后，他用无人机运送过的东西也越来越多，蔬菜、药品、卫生纸……俞冬平说：“每一次飞行回来，只要对飞机和物资进行消毒，真正做到了无接触配送！”    积攒了“飞行经验”的他，让这架无人机做起了“跑腿小哥”，给周围邻居免费服务，他和他的无人机也成了小区里的“红人”。谁家有药品等紧急物资需要递送，且重量又在无人机的承受氛围之内，就会在微信群里告诉俞冬平，他线上“接单”后，派出无人机去取货送货。渐渐地，“无人机送货”这件事，成了这个拥有3000多名居民的小区里的“新晋顶流”，找他帮忙的人络绎不绝，每天几乎都是飞到无人机没电才“歇工”。    俞冬平曾经是一名海军战士，在进入铁路部门工作后，多次出色完成过在上海南站的安保任务。他的微信个性签名是“我的心永远炙热”，在战疫中他也用一颗炙热的心去帮助别人：“面对疫情，再煎熬也要咬紧牙关，团结一致，能打仗，打胜仗。特殊时期，只要是能方便大家、帮助大家的事情，我都愿意去尝试。”  本报记者  金志刚,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/5.htm,5/7/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
,宝宝有奶粉喝了  老人有肉蛋吃了,59份“暖心礼包”送到高龄老人、残障人士、重病患者等特殊人群家,    缺米缺面缺肉缺蛋缺奶！今天，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”融媒体平台在今日头条、抖音开设的“紧急求助热线直播”已进入第16天。连日来，又有不少高龄老人、残障人士、重病患者等特殊人群给“新民帮侬忙”发来求助：家中生活物资紧缺。虽然街道、居委会也多次配送，但仍有不足，希望能给他们送些急需的“口粮”。    光明集团、中国邮政上海市黄浦区分公司、街道和居委会、小区志愿者……5月5日上午8时起，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟集结出发——牛奶、鸡蛋、大米、挂面、食用油、午餐肉……59份“暖心礼包”送到特殊人群手中。“宝宝有奶喝了！”“家中有粮了！”“老人有肉有蛋吃了！”……昨晚，100多个来电几乎把记者的手机打爆，一声声的感谢，让所有小伙伴安心了。    而此前，“战疫·帮侬忙”融媒体平台联合上海市残疾人联合会、上海宋庆龄基金会、瑞银集团、顺丰速递、途虎养车以及不愿透露姓名的公益企业和公益个人，已向特殊人群捐赠了三批物资（详见4月26日3版《风雨中，米肉蛋粥送到……》、5月2日5版《226个“暖心大礼包”送到特殊人群家》、5月5日5版《紧急求助热线直播13天  当场解决“急难愁”201件》），共计1488份。    老人们想吃鸡蛋牛奶    家住虹口区曲阳路851弄沪办大厦的周女士是社区志愿者，最近她在走访中发现，不少高龄老人的子女都不在身边，网购团购是力不从心，家中“口粮”已是“坐吃山空”。记者随即与曲阳路街道取得联系，工作人员告知，沪办大厦共2栋商住楼，有300多户居民，其中70岁以上老人34户，此前街道曾派发过蔬菜、米面等多轮物资，也安排了志愿者定期上门看望，“如果你们能再支援点牛奶、肉类和鸡蛋，让老人补补身子，就再好不过了！”    家住曲阳路610弄的赵女士是位单亲妈妈，目前独自照顾刚满10个月的宝宝。近几日，家中米、面、鸡蛋所剩无几，宝宝喝的奶粉也最多再撑一周，“我少吃一顿两顿都无所谓，可宝宝饿不起啊！”赵女士急得直流眼泪。    杨浦区宁武路286号一家按摩店内的张先生也是心急如焚。他告诉记者，店里有3名盲人按摩师，生活起居都由他来照料。但一个多月来，线上抢菜常常“颗粒无收”，而他们这里是沿街商铺，又搭不上社区团购的“便车”，时日一长，店内生活物资告急。    家住黄浦区五里桥路235弄的朱老伯右眼失明，身患肠癌，妻子也卧病在床。小区封控的日子里，老两口基本靠街道发放的物资度日。由于牛奶、鸡蛋等“稀缺物资”一直无法买到，老人的日常营养跟不上，身体每况愈下。    “暖心礼包”送达9个区    在汇总核实相关信息后，“战疫·帮侬忙”融媒体平台立刻向公益联盟发出“紧急求助”。“物资，我们来！”公益企业光明食品集团立即协调多家仓库，精心挑选旗下优质品牌的牛奶、鸡蛋、大米、挂面、食用油、午餐肉等，整整忙碌了两天两夜，配齐了特殊人群急需的“暖心礼包”。而针对于宝宝们“不能停”的奶粉，公司全力筹措，也备足了货源。    跨越浦江两岸、“点对点”的配送重任，被中国邮政上海市黄浦区分公司接下了。昨天一早，公司党委书记刘丽芳和寄递部副经理汤松桦带领6名员工，兵分四路，将物资送往上海9个区24处地点。上午11时20分许，首批34份物资运抵虹口区沪办大厦，街道、物业、志愿者在卸货、消杀后，把“紧缺物资”挨家挨户送上了门。“看到这么多东西，阿姨爷叔都开心煞了！”志愿者周女士欣慰地说。    “虹口区送达！”“杨浦区送达！”“闵行区送达！”“宝山区送达！”“浦东新区送达！”……昨天17时许，59户特殊人群陆续收到了沉甸甸的“暖心礼包”。昨天气温达30摄氏度，奔忙一天的配送员们早已大汗淋漓，但他们的话语里却是满满的“幸福感”：“能帮到人的感觉真好！”    本报记者  房浩    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月6日11时至5月7日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求274件，其中紧急类诉求127件，已推动解决102件（含“公益联盟”16件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/6.htm,5/7/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,为美林书画题句,,    冯骥才    笔墨相赠是文人间的交往。此间没有应酬，更无勉强，皆一时的性情或兴致使然。一次，美林赠我两张小画，一牛一马，都是用粗头的马克笔画在一种仿旧的宣纸上。纸颇奇特，是一种仿古纸，颜色一如唐宋书画中常见的那种赤黄的老绢或老纸，上边布满斑驳的旧痕。美林画“马克笔画”拿手，用笔简括至极，雄劲老到，活力四射，独往开来，具有开天地的意味。这马这牛画得分外好，是精品。我笑道：“再有些题跋和图章就是唐人或宋人的画了。”    他说：“你再去随笔题吧。”    我遂题了。在《马》上题曰：“画动物者因何都是韩家人？韩干画马，韩滉画牛，画牛马者韩美林也。莫非前世都是当牛做马？你问我，我不知，还是要问美林。丁酉秋至。骥才。”    一日，兴趣忽至，复又题：“我身上有四马，姓中二马，名是一马，又属马，驷马难追是也。”    在另一幅《牛》上题曰：“美林画牛有唐人雄风，健硕威武，不输韩滉。用笔极简，须臾即成，此时年已八旬，犹具这般豪气，真奇迹也。丁酉夏日沽上心居主人。骥才。”    后再题曰：“牛有犟劲，狮虎无此性情也。”    美林的画太具个性，牛性强犟，马性奔放，韩美林天性奔放又强犟，故其最爱画牛马是也。    再一次，我去看他，他拿出两个装裱成同样的手卷，写的是狂草书法，从头到尾排山倒海，激情奔泻。他说这手卷要请我题跋，两卷同样内容，然后他一卷，我一卷。我拿回画室，放在画案上打开，一股雄风扑面而来，他的书法燃起我的诗情，随即题曰：    “书史不留鹦鹉客，    只记开天辟地人，    张颠素狂皆已矣，    谁能挥笔扫千军？    醉墨醒笔由心性，    呼风唤雨自为神。    翰墨一卷随手展，    千里云涌伴龙吟。    观美林狂草歌。骥才。”    题罢钤印，将两卷都拿给美林。他留下一卷，另一卷给我存藏与把玩。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/7.htm,5/7/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,师父,,    江子    那一年暑假，我中考放假在家无聊，且对考上高中毫无把握，就开始寻思着读书之外的路。    作为一名赣中地区的乡村少年，所谓读书之外的路，不外乎是学一门手艺，做一名手艺人。    赣中地区的手艺不少，比较普遍的是泥瓦匠、木匠、篾匠、剃头匠、杀猪匠。    泥瓦匠要忍受风吹日晒，木匠要使大力，剃头老要站着，杀猪更是力气活。做篾匠不太费力，风吹不着雨淋不着，而且吃喝不愁，伙食是差不了的，村里的篾匠每出门一段时间，回来必皮毛光彩。而且，我有一个堂叔，因为做篾竟然带回来一个漂亮的、满口异乡方言的女人，整个村子都轰动了。    正碰上有个篾匠师傅正愁着找不到徒弟，我就向他毛遂自荐。他迟疑了一会儿，最终带上了我。    师傅之所以迟疑，那是因为他与我关系不一般。直说了吧，他是我父亲。    父亲的篾匠活做得好。他做的篾席子，七年八年不会坏，他做的竹床，别的篾匠师傅可能早散架了，他的呢，依然铁箍一样结实。他打的簸箕、箩筐、晒垫，都经久耐用，而且美观。凭着这手艺，父亲成了远近闻名的篾匠大师傅，手下有不少徒弟。许多徒弟出师之后还跟着他，靠着他的事主（就是客户）资源生活。    那是在一个有月光的夜晚，我们一行五人——我和父亲，父亲的两个当上了师傅的大徒弟孔狗子和刘猪仔，还有一个是猪仔的徒弟——从家乡出发，在三里路远的西沙埠码头过赣江的趸船上拦到了一辆拖拉机。听着哐当哐当的车响，看着月光下丘陵阴影重重如野兽奔腾，我们向着我们此行的目的地、田地资源丰富的赣江以东奔去。    从赣江以西的我们村到目的地赣江以东的双村也就三十多里地，我们在一个镇上下了车，然后徒步半个小时左右就到了。我们的到来，引起了村民们的一阵骚动，看得出父亲他们在这里的人缘不错。父亲与人们谈天说地，说农药化肥，说庄稼耕作，间或说几句当地方言，完全是一副精明能干、热情活泛的样子，与在家乡的笨嘴拙舌完全不可同日而语，让我十分吃惊。    有人看到陌生的我，问父亲是否新带的小徒弟。父亲点了点头，算是默认。我们中其他人都心照不宣，没有将我和父亲的真正关系说破。    第二天一早我们就开始上工。我开始了真正的篾徒的生活。    我们的活计都由父亲上门与人沟通，然后根据活的多少难易安排时间与人员。    父亲跟他的两个大徒弟根据手艺特长互有分工。比如孔狗子织晒垫或凉席技术要好，他就经常被安排织晒垫、凉席。刘猪仔做箩筐簸箕水平要高一些，他就主要负责箩筐簸箕团箕的活计。父亲把总，或者是挑最难的活儿，比如做竹床、竹椅。    竹器的原材料是竹子，竹子剖开后形成竹片，竹片分青黄两层，师傅们要根据需要将青黄两层分解成织造竹器的篾片。十米长的竹子，就要分解成若干跟十米长的篾片。要让这些篾片变得光滑，除了师傅手中的篾刀和夹着篾片的篾条（相当于木匠手里让木头变得光滑的刨子），还要徒弟们往返拉篾。篾匠这一行最常见的场景，就是师傅坐着刮篾，后面一个小徒儿拉着十几米的篾片来回跑。    我每天到一个新的主人家，先等着师傅把竹子破开，然后来回跑着拉篾，一两个小时下来，常常累得全身是汗。    拉完篾，师傅们忙着干织造的大活儿，我就或蹲或坐，对着破了的晒垫、席子、箩筐，用新的篾片，修补着上面的破绽。    老实说开始的几天，我的感觉是新奇的，想想自己很可能一辈子就干这个，我不免对手中的工作有了仪式感。我每天极其认真地拉篾，修补，缠着师傅们教我篾匠行当的江湖行话。那是一些在别人的屋檐下不想让在现场的主人听明白的话，既神秘又有趣。    为了让自己很快地像一个篾徒，我煞有介事地学着师傅们的口吻粗野地说话，还学着喝上了酒。我大大咧咧痞里痞气的样子，让师傅们直摇头。中餐与晚餐，我都与师傅们一起喝一点主人准备的米酒。喝酒开始我会有一点晕，但过了几天就习惯了。    可这样的日子并没有过多久，我开始有了深深的厌倦。    ——我是父亲的儿子的消息不知怎么被当地人知道了。父亲因此受到当地人的揶揄。是呀，在人们的观念里，父亲做篾，儿子也做篾，这个家庭，还有多少奔头呢。    我想父亲一定十分恼怒。因为我看着他手艺间隙抽口烟时，眉头比以前皱得更厉害了，对我更是一副爱理不理的样子。    而我依然吊儿郎当。我何必去看他的脸色呢。    可父亲终于忍不住了。那次我们五人全在一家人上工。我拉完篾后去修补一个破了角的箩筐。那其实是有难度的活计，用于修补的篾片从箩筐角的这个面出来，必须在另一个面找到对应的路径。我手中的篾片一再踌躇，然后自以为是地插入了一个错误的轨道之中。一片篾片错了就满盘错，最终这个箩筐的角被我补得漏洞百出。    父亲远远地发现了我的错误（我怀疑他一直在偷偷看着我），开始骂骂咧咧，最后火气越来越大，大声历数我的种种不是，我的倔劲儿上来了。我也忍了好久呢。我把箩筐掷于一旁，说我不干了。父亲更气了。他手上的动作幅度越来越大，口里骂着：“你现在就滚！”    我毫不分说起身丢下工具就往外走。我的泪水流了下来。为了不让别人看见我的泪水我开始奔跑。然后我听到了后面的喊声。”你回来。不要跑！我们过两天再回！”那是我的师傅，也是我的父亲。他的声音已经远不是刚才的暴跳如雷，而是虚弱得像是在求饶。    我终于又回到了课堂，做了一名初三的复读生。我才十五岁，可经过了那一段生活，我一改过去的顽劣，变得老成持重，不苟言笑。一年后我的努力有了回报。我考上了师范，成了一名端上了国家饭碗、让父亲在他的赣江以东的事主们面前倍有脸面的人。    那段日子早已成为了往事。如今我已经是一个到知天命之年的人了。我的父亲也早已是古稀之年的老者。可那段经历，依然嵌在我们的生命里。这么多年来，每到除夕团圆饭，我家餐桌上有个仪式必不可少：我倒上满满一杯酒，向着父亲喊着“师父”，然后一饮而尽。而父亲总是满脸凛然端起杯子，抿上两口，仿佛当年做篾时，他端坐首席表情平静，而所有人，都自觉向他俯首称臣。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-07/8.htm,5/7/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

“愿天下所有母亲，节日快乐，身体健康！”,方舱医院上演一幕幕动容告白,,    “我下班啦，现在回去（驻地）休息，你们还好吗？”昨晚，刚刚脱下“大白”的龙华医院儿科护士长费小琴拨通了电话，和母亲连线。电话那头，母亲还是像往常那般告诉她，家里一切都好，你自己要注意防护。此时，6岁的女儿“抢”过电话：“妈妈，提前祝你节日快乐！我想你了！你工作很忙吧？外公今天又给我烧了我喜欢的胡萝卜！”    今天是母亲节，在金山天华路方舱医院，尽管在院患者人数日益减少，但该有的“仪式感”，医疗队员们一点也不马虎。上海建工运维团队也克服困难，悄悄准备好了鲜花。方舱医院里成了大型“表白”现场，一幕幕动容的告白，也诉说着医患齐心战胜疫情的决心。    云端相见  那份爱意不减    “我今天很乖的，自己一个人做了好几张外婆给我出的数学卷子，每一张都是100分哦！不过今天我没有弹琴。妈妈，我可不可以一天隔一天弹琴呀？爸爸都不知道我弹得对不对，你说他搞笑不搞笑？”电话那头，女儿的小嘴一开口就说个不停，可对费小琴来说，却是好一顿“破防”。    在舱里工作时，费小琴也收到了鲜花，她和当值的“妈妈大白”在护士站留下了一张特殊的合影。    “那一刻想到了些什么？”    “往年的母亲节都会陪妈妈和婆婆去逛逛街、买买新衣服，然后吃一顿美食回家。”她说，今年她还身处抗击疫情的最前线，很感谢家里的支持，让她毫无牵挂在方舱医院里照顾更多需要被照顾的人。“待凯旋之日一定再为两位妈妈补过一次母亲节！”    在电话里，费小琴强忍住泪水，叮嘱女儿，照顾好自己，不要给外公、外婆、爸爸添乱。“看着外公，不能让他‘偷吃’太多的糕点；看着外婆，不要让她吃得太咸，叮嘱他们按时吃药，好好休息；还要提醒爸爸，不要一直坐在电脑前工作，要起来运动一下……”    作为儿科护士长，更身为一位母亲，费小琴最见不得孩子吃苦了。舱里有一位患儿，发烧近40℃，她赶紧用冷水毛巾冷敷额头、温水擦拭等方法进行物理降温护理，并积极进行“清天河水”传统推拿手法来帮助降温。没多久，孩子体温恢复正常，此后也没有出现反弹，平安出院。    同在一起  那份了解更深    “她真的很不错，很孝顺我，也很能吃苦，照顾孩子特别用心！”患者方阿姨指着自己的儿媳妇竖起了大拇指。    “妈，节日快乐！”儿子和儿媳将鲜花递到了她跟前。方阿姨和儿子、媳妇以及孙子一起住进了金山天华路方舱医院C舱，通过中西医结合治疗，很快就能回家了。    平时，一家人并不住在一起。不幸的感染经历倒也“安排”了一段在方舱里朝夕相处的日子。婆媳间也对彼此有了更深的了解。“阿拉这一代过过艰苦的日子，‘90后’在我们眼里还是孩子。没想到也能吃苦的，一点不娇气。”方阿姨告诉记者，儿媳在方舱里把自己和孩子都照顾得很好，也让她特别感动。在医护人员的细心护理下，一家子的身体也一天比一天好，再过两天就能出院了。    妈妈小英表示，孩子爸爸会记录下他们在方舱生活的每一天。自己作为母亲，在照顾孩子健康成长的同时，也要把宝贝幼儿时期在方舱生活的日子记录下来，作为他人生中的一段重要的经历，等他长大了懂事了，也会讲给他听。“愿天下所有母亲，节日快乐，身体健康！”她动情地说。    在方舱里，温暖还在不断上演——    安安（化名）接过在方舱医院里结识的好朋友、“大白”黄凯欢阿姨递过的鲜花，又在方舱书屋里画了一张贺卡，藏在了身后。蹑手蹑脚地走到妈妈身边，有点害羞地说:“妈妈，祝你节日快乐！”孩子永远是妈妈们的共同话题，安安妈妈和黄凯欢已经很熟络了，经常在一起交流育儿经验。“已经记不清有多久没有亲过女儿肉嘟嘟的脸，有多久没有陪她一起玩了。”听到黄凯欢这么说，安安妈妈走上前，紧紧握住了她的手。本报记者  郜阳,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-08/4.htm,5/8/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,笑脸“气球”送母亲,,    “妈妈，这个‘开心’娃娃好看吗？送给你！妈妈辛苦了，节日快乐！”昨天傍晚，金山区山阳镇山新居委会门口，4岁的“开心”拿着一个白色、画有笑脸的“气球”送给母亲何满意，母女俩露出温馨的微笑。    仔细一看，这个气球其实是一只医用手套。原来，有心的居委会干部赵丹红在陪“开心”玩耍时，突然想到第二天是母亲节，于是就地取材，顺手拿了只防护手套，让同事朱春涛帮忙吹气后，和孩子一起在手套上画了个笑脸。    何满意是一位单亲妈妈，今年32岁，在山新居委会主要负责实有人口信息采集工作。3月27日晚上9时半，她服从安排，带着孩子一起来到单位上班，一呆就是40多天。“孩子实在没人带，万不得已才把她带来，好在‘开心’很乖，不怕生，‘开心’这个小名还是我们娄冬梅副书记帮忙取的，叔叔阿姨们都很喜欢她，经常给她买好吃的，待在这里还胖了几斤，真心感谢同事们这段时间对我们娘俩的照顾。”何满意感激地说。    在这次疫情防控工作中，何满意和赵丹红等一起负责滨海花苑小区的核酸检测、抗原筛查和物资发放等工作。滨海花苑共有32栋楼，646户1300多人。最辛苦的是刚开始几天，大家经常忙到凌晨才休息，早上四五点就到小区点位做准备工作。有时候也有遇到个别居民不理解的，莫名其妙冲着何满意她们“骂”。好在何满意以前在超市服务台工作过，被骂过，也哭过，也算“久经沙场”。如今，她又经历了生活的种种磨难，变得更加坚韧。    经常有居民给“何满意们”送来木耳红枣羹、牛奶、感谢信等，小区的志愿者都十分给力，报名比“抢菜”还抢手；何满意有时候晚上要加班、早上出工早，保洁阿姨谢南芳就帮忙带孩子，帮孩子穿衣服、喂饭等；看到孩子鞋子穿脏、穿小了，同为人母的娄冬梅就想办法帮“开心”买了双新鞋子。“我只有努力工作，才对得起大家对我们娘俩的厚爱。”何满意指着孩子脚上的新鞋说。    “满意在居委会工作三年，很认真，对居民情况特别熟悉，做到底数清、情况明，对小区核酸检测、发放物资等工作都起到了很大作用。”赵丹红说，“开心”很可爱，也很乖，还经常帮我们干活，她是我们大家的小开心，工作累了，抱抱她就感觉不怎么累了。    今天，又是金山全区全员核酸筛查的一天。何满意和同事们元气满满，早早准备好了试管、棉签、防护服和手套等，为坚决打赢大上海保卫战而努力！本报记者  屠瑜  通讯员  王萍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-08/5.htm,5/8/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
,92岁“兵爷爷”终于换了导尿管,公益联盟以最快速度完成爱心接力，老人要给所有帮过自己的人敬军礼 ,    求助    父亲今年92岁，参加过抗美援朝出国作战，是中国人民志愿军老兵，荣立过两次三等功。由于小区封控，老人已近两个月没换过导尿管，整个人痛苦不堪。希望你们能帮帮我的父亲。    虹口区飞虹路258弄  何先生    帮忙>>>    这件事阿拉包下了    昨天中午12时，在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播连线中，何先生透露经过“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟工作人员陈大骏多方联络，公益企业百联集团旗下第一医药已送来导尿管、引流袋、注射器等14样全套耗材。“老人痛苦，阿拉比伊更痛苦！”听到何先生的话语，记者当即表示，“侬放心，这件事我们包下了！”下午1时40分，大众出租车司机彭广兵载上“小护来了”的章青护士从长宁区出发，在前往上海第一医药拿好防护装备后，于下午2时30分赶到老人所在的小区。下午2时40分，章青上门为老人换好导尿管。    当年曾两立三等功    昨晚在记者回访中，何先生说起了“父辈的故事”——他的父亲名叫何拔萃，生于1931年1月。1950年11月，19岁的父亲报名参军，开赴抗美援朝作战前线。他当时在中国人民志愿军后勤司令部服役，司令员正是后来的开国上将洪学智。由于何拔萃是高中生，经过培训后被安排在师部团队，任保密部电文校对员。在何先生发来的“复原军人证明书”上，照片里清秀的面容、坚定的眼神，正是何拔萃年轻时的模样。    “当时，志愿军的重要通讯和情报，都要通过电报传递。发送电报前，必须再三核对，如果出现差错，就会贻误战机，导致志愿军战士付出生命的代价。”何先生至今还记得，小时候父亲总喜欢让自己坐在他的膝盖上，回忆那些年的故事，一讲起来就是一个下午。老人曾说过，他因为在实战中核查出电报中的错误，而两次荣立“三等功”。何先生说，当父亲拿到国家颁发给他的“中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战70周年纪念奖章”时，激动不已，立刻佩戴好奖章，对着镜子深深地敬了个军礼。    1953年，何拔萃复员后分配到上海市第十机床厂，成为一名技术员。1979年，老人又支援金山石化直到退休。“当时从金山来回一趟很远很不方便，但父亲从没怨言。他总是讲，国家把他放在什么岗位，就要踏踏实实做好这份工作。”    老人盼当面谢恩人    在何先生的记忆里，父亲一生坚强乐观，教育小辈要勤俭生活，要积极面对困难。何先生表示，父亲的身体状况一直不错，心态也好。直到一年前，才因泌尿系统出现问题，而无法主动排尿。“我们多次陪他去医院看过，医生建议，老人年纪大了，手术风险过大。所以采取插导尿管的保守疗法，也就有了这一次的求助……”    何先生坦言，老人从不愿意麻烦别人，是他“自作主张”给“新民帮侬忙”发来信息，换好导尿管后，自己才将来龙去脉告诉父亲。“父亲特别感动，一定要我代为转达谢意。他说等身体好了，一定要当面给所有帮过自己的人敬个军礼！”本报记者  徐驰  钱俊毅,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-08/6.htm,5/8/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,走进文洁若先生的书房,,    胡天    今年是人民文学出版社建社71周年，社里同事说要去文洁若先生家为她录段视频，因为文先生是1951年入职的建社元老。    3月15日下午，我们来到文先生家。一进屋，只见她正坐在窗边的写字台前忙碌着，把对我们事先提问的回答工工整整地写在稿纸上。因为日文编辑没来，文先生马上叮嘱我，回社时请他把文先生翻译的一部作品的日文版后记送来。    墙上挂着文先生清华大学的毕业照，她戴着学士帽，英气勃勃，旁边是萧乾先生年轻时的照片，“不带地图的旅人”笑容满面地注视着我们。    文先生身后的书架上，是一摞摞工具书，其中的汉英词典、日汉词典和汉语词典已翻烂，书芯书壳脱离，但书壳外是用布缝制的“书衣”。文先生说，那是她亲手缝的。用的是旧布，但穿在词典身上，让人感到合体又温暖。在工具书中，还有两本年代久远的德汉词典，原来文先生在大学期间也学过德文，难怪她译的一篇日文小说中，所有原文用德文的地方她都加了详细的注释。    在小书架上，我们还看到一本书页泛黄的日文版《日本文学史》，这本书的中文版当年是文老师责编的。翻开书，发现书中有几处钢笔修改的笔迹，原来是日文版中的编校和排印错误，被文老师一一改正了过来。    文先生回忆起1951年刚进社的情形。那时出版社刚成立，因陋就简，总共只有三排小小的二层筒子楼，坐落在隆福寺对面的一条小胡同里。和文先生同年进入人文社的还有她在清华大学外国语文学系的三位同学：王笠耘、张奇和水建馥。开会时，他们就把自己办公用的椅子搬到侧面的小平房里，平时那里设了乒乓球台子，所以那间小屋被叫作“俱乐部”。    文先生说，对她影响最大的人文社同事是冯雪峰先生。刚入社时，文先生在外国文学编辑室苏联东欧组工作过一段时期，当过《青年近卫军》的责任编辑。叶水夫先生是译者。她一段段地根据俄文核对，发现水夫先生漏译了一大段，水夫先生高高兴兴地把这段补译了。文先生还回忆起，在那段动荡的岁月里，始终热心关照她的两位同事：江秉祥和谈家芳。    文先生在人文社编辑了大量日本文学图书。除了做编辑，她或因工作需要，或在业余时间，翻译了很多日本和英语文学作品，被授予“中国翻译终身成就奖”。    文先生已经九十五岁高龄，但她每天还在认认真真地翻译，今年春节前，她还亲自去社里送稿子。    见到社里的新同事，文先生很开心，她为我们朗读了那本日文版《日本文学史》片段，还为我们唱了好几首日文儿歌，从她灿烂的笑容中，我们仿佛又看到了那个在日本读小学的中国小女孩。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-08/7.htm,5/8/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,母亲的牵挂,,    袁秋茜    五月的风是带着腾腾的热气的，它吹得人身子酥软，有了几分迷离。我趴在窗户边，看着梨树绿硕的叶子，想着梨花凋落没几天呢，万物竟悄悄地有了夏天的味道。    到处是绿肥红瘦的光景，但五一假期，我仍旧在出租屋里，哪里也去不了。听着林莺啼到无声处，我的心思也飘到了远方。想去芍药园看花，想躺在郊野的草坡上，想摘鲜嫩诱人的草莓，想晒着暖阳打瞌睡……    就在我这么想着的时候，母亲打来电话。“丫头，你在干什么呢？”听得出来，母亲百无聊赖。我卷着发丝，说发呆呢。母亲笑了笑，说我是个呆丫头，然后又笑，爷俩都呆呆的。    原来，父亲一早醒来没事干，看了一上午楼下的猫，还不住地猜着猫的心思。他和母亲说，猫一定是想要抓池塘里的鱼，不然怎么老在水边走，不怕掉下去么？又说，或许猫也不是要吃鱼，就是无聊，想逗逗鱼玩，时不时将爪子伸进水里，吓得鱼儿不敢浮出水面……母亲这些天和父亲说了太多话，陈芝麻滥谷子的事情都说完了，找不到啥新话题，遂和我打电话。    我明白母亲的用意。她需要有人和她讲话，她想听些新鲜事。于是，我高兴地和她讲最近居委发的物资，有一只整鸡呢，另外还有一箱牛奶，生菜、茄子、黄瓜、青椒，品类不少呢！讲到这些吃的，母亲来了兴致。她追问，你打算怎么烧那只鸡啊？知道这些菜先吃哪个吗？要按照菜存放的时间去做饭，懂么？    母亲啊，她一辈子围着灶台，穿梭于田间，对于做饭的相关事情熟悉得不能再熟悉，说起来也滔滔不绝。我对她这样的神采飞扬感到开心。因疫情滞留在上海，她受了很多的苦，能这样聊聊，心情会舒畅很多。    ——还是几个月前，晚上我躺在床上看书，忽然接到妈妈打过来的视频电话。电话那头的她很兴奋，举着手机在屋子里不停地转，急切地问我：“看出来了吗？看出来我在哪里了吗？”我定睛一瞧，她身后是粗粝的水泥墙，横七竖八的木板，还有穿着工装贴砖的爸爸……她竟然来了上海，我惊讶得一时说不出来话。    随着她的镜头，我看着他们目前打工的住处。毛坯房，十分简陋，徒有四壁，等待被爸爸这样的工人装修。吃睡一个地方，马桶也是临时安装的，上面都是水泥灰。妈妈掀起塑料布，指着两床被褥，说她和爸爸昨晚一床垫一床盖，虽然睡在地上，挤挤也不觉得冷。两个涂漆桶上铺个硬纸板，一盘咸菜炒豆腐，一碗蚕豆蛋花汤，还有两碗米饭，他们的晚饭是如此简单。我心一紧地疼，不禁问她：“那你觉得是来打工辛苦，还是在老家种田辛苦啊？”    妈妈喝了口汤，想了想说：“各有各的不容易，但是我都不觉得累啊。我是不放心你爸受过伤的脚，跟过来帮他做做饭，不干什么体力活儿。我这辈子很少出来，这回算是见见世面，也了解你们爷俩生活的城市……”    在妈妈眼里，这是她离老公和女儿最近的一次旅程。    结束通话后，我想起幼时，妈妈一个人在家务农，有一次她挑着两桶水去田间浇庄稼，天很热，她走得很急，一个没注意就被石头绊倒了。在田边玩耍的我，看着妈妈连人带桶地摔倒，连忙跑过去。妈妈的手和膝盖被石子擦伤，渗着血，我一下子就哭了，仿佛受伤的人是我。妈妈笑嘻嘻地拥我入怀，轻拍着我的背说：“别哭别哭，妈妈不疼，妈妈不累……”    如今的妈妈不如曾经年轻有力，头发已经花白，她离开自己耕种的田地，来到城市做爸爸的帮工，在坚硬的钢筋水泥中微笑，云淡风轻地告诉我：妈妈不累，也不疼……黑夜中，我的眼角有泪珠滑落。    ——想着这些，我走神了。母亲突然不说话了，长叹一声。我忙问怎么了。她欲言又止，还是禁不住说：“丫头啊，你说这疫情啥时候结束啊？我放心不下家里。”她放心不下什么呢？是那越长越高的香菜；是那发了芽的玉米种子无人播种；是那过于成熟的油菜籽“啪啦啦”地炸在地里……母亲念叨着，要是人在老家，肯定将地翻了几遍，场上晒了油菜籽，玉米秧长得很精神，人忙得脚都不停歇嘞。    我明白，母亲是一个农家人，此刻正是一年春种好时机。她爱的是耕耘，是在那片土地上种植自己的希望，人随庄稼的生长而欢喜，踏踏实实，日日有新。可现在，她在毛坯房里，每日除了用发放的食物做个一日三餐，就是听安排做检测。她心急如焚啊，可又无可奈何。只有等，等解封，等上海回老家的交通恢复正常，她立马就要回去。    大家都在盼。有人盼着复工，有人盼着出去玩，有人盼着吃好喝好，有人盼着团圆……而我的母亲，她盼着早日回到故乡，回到她的庄稼旁，站在一大片的麦田前，看着风吹麦浪，飞鸟拾穗比人忙。    妈妈，会好的。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-08/8.htm,5/8/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,读一本好书，可以明白很多道理,——关于丹钦科的回忆录《文艺·戏剧·生活》,    杨扬    这些天在书房里翻来翻去，想找一本好看的书消遣，最终吸引我的是弗·伊斯坦布·涅米罗维奇-丹钦科的回忆录《文艺·戏剧·生活》，译者是大名鼎鼎的焦菊隐先生。    丹钦科的名字对于熟悉戏剧的人来说，并不陌生，他是十九世纪末至二十世纪初俄罗斯的大导演，一生最大的贡献，是与斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基一起创建了莫斯科艺术剧院，将契诃夫的《海鸥》《三姊妹》和《樱桃园》等作品成功搬上舞台。斯坦尼将这些戏剧表演的舞台经验提升为系统的戏剧理论，建立起席卷全球的斯坦尼体系。从戏剧专业角度讲，丹钦科做了一件非常了不起的事，是他最早意识到契诃夫戏剧的潜在价值，说服了对戏剧创作失去信心的契诃夫，同意将《海鸥》重新排演；也是丹钦科说服了斯坦尼，请他留意契诃夫戏剧不同于以往任何剧作家作品的特殊之处。记得王元化先生在晚年谈戏剧的文章中，曾批评斯坦尼理论体系的僵硬，而把其中的一些有价值的戏剧发现归功于丹钦科。    从丹钦科的回忆中，我感受到的不只是戏剧艺术方面的启发，而是一切文艺成长过程都必须经历的历练和必需的素养。在丹钦科成功之前，他像很多人一样经历过挫折和失败，但他没有气馁。他有自己的艺术理想，一路走来，因为理念不同，不得不跟自己昔日的同仁、朋友分道扬镳，直到他遇见斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基，两人一拍即合，创建了莫斯科艺术剧院，着力打造属于艺术剧院特有的演出剧目，最终获得成功。斯坦尼之所以能够和丹钦科合作，除了他有胸怀能够容纳丹钦科之外，也与艺术理念上的意气相投有关，他们都不满于当时流行的戏剧演出，希望创建一家符合自己戏剧理念的艺术剧院。建立艺术剧院，除了钱，除了演职人员，最重要的还是要能够提供高品质的戏剧剧目。照一般人的想法，找名角，排演一些戏剧史上叫得响的剧目，总会名利双收。但丹钦科之所以高出同时代的很多导演，就在于他放弃了这种行业陈规，选择了一条属于艺术剧院特有的戏剧演艺新路。他是最早意识到契诃夫的剧作《海鸥》符合艺术剧院的创新理念，具有巨大的艺术潜力。这一探索过程也是世界艺术史上极其有名的创新案例：《海鸥》最初由名望比莫斯科艺术剧院大得多的圣彼得堡小剧院排演，在圣彼得堡上演时，完全失败。当时对剧作家契诃夫的精神重创，可以从契诃夫的书信中看出。他沮丧至极，感受到巨大的羞辱；他甚至怀疑自己的戏剧写作才能，表示再也不写剧本了。    在莫斯科艺术剧院第一次演出《海鸥》时，契诃夫躲到外地，不敢到场观看演出。演出的第一幕刚刚合上时，剧场长时间静默，演员们几乎绝望得要哭出声来，突然观众席上爆发出掌声，这掌声越来越大，经久不息，最后演出获得了巨大的成功。在这一过程中，承受压力最大的，是导演丹钦科。他不仅要说服契诃夫同意他排演《海鸥》，而且还要不断提醒包括斯坦尼在内的剧组所有人员，《海鸥》不是一般的戏剧，是与历史上以往所有戏剧完全不一样的伟大的戏剧。我想这不仅仅需要极大的勇气，更需要极高的艺术鉴赏力。    丹钦科在回忆录中，非常详尽地记录了自己是怎样走近契诃夫的，简单地说，是在长期的戏剧表导演实践和戏剧教学训练中，丹钦科看到了现有戏剧表演的种种不足，萌生出寻找新的出路的念头，并在契诃夫戏剧中最终找到了突破口。对于莫斯科艺术剧院而言，排演《海鸥》是一个标志，丹钦科在回忆录中说，莫斯科艺术剧院此前排演过其他一些剧作家的剧目，但俄罗斯评论家一致认为，莫斯科艺术剧院是从《海鸥》的排演开始，具有了自己的标志和品牌。它不仅是在排演剧目，更是把它自己的一套戏剧标准，贯彻到每一个具体排练和演出环节，与世界上一些著名的演出剧团相比，其形成了鲜明的特点，这种特点显示出莫斯科艺术剧院在艺术理念上的创新和领先，在世界范围内吸引了很多剧团纷纷效仿，对世界戏剧产生了广泛影响。    莫斯科艺术剧院是中国戏剧艺术家们学习的楷模，一提艺术剧院，人们便会不自觉地想到契诃夫的戏剧，曹禺先生称之为“契诃夫情结”。焦菊隐先生在1940年代抗战困难时期，抱病翻译丹钦科的回忆录，这种选择体现了中国戏剧艺术家的理想品格和艺术识见。焦菊隐是燕京大学的毕业生，1935年赴法国巴黎大学学习，1938年获博士学位。他回国后担任过多所艺校的专业教师，因不满教学过程中的不良习气，离开院校，自己翻译、介绍国外的戏剧作品，希望以此推动中国戏剧艺术向高水平方向发展。除了翻译丹钦科的回忆录，焦菊隐还将契诃夫的《伊凡诺夫》《海鸥》《凡尼亚舅舅》《三姊妹》和《樱桃园》等剧作翻译过来，介绍给中国读者。他是中国斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基戏剧理论的忠实践行者，但也正是焦菊隐，最早在中国话剧领域提出了民族化与民族风格问题。作为北京人民艺术剧院第一任总导演，焦菊隐先生是把莫斯科艺术剧院作为自己心目中的理想标杆，他希望北京人艺像莫斯科艺术剧院那样拥有一系列属于自己独特品牌的优秀演出剧目。他执导的郭沫若的历史剧《虎符》《蔡文姬》，老舍的《龙须沟》，都有不俗的表现，但最具标志性的话剧是他导演的《茶馆》。《茶馆》之于北京人艺，犹如《海鸥》之于莫斯科艺术剧院，从此中国戏剧人就以这样的剧目演出标准来要求中国的话剧艺术，不仅仅是表导演，而且还包括排练、舞美等一系列与戏剧相关的环节，都有了明确的标准和规范，所以，有评论者认为《茶馆》不仅仅是一部优秀话剧，更是新中国“国家戏剧”的最高典范。但这种“国家戏剧”不是国家意志灌输下来的结果，而是像焦菊隐、老舍这样一批杰出的戏剧艺术家持之以恒、长期努力的结果，而焦菊隐先生的这种戏剧理想，正是从丹钦科的回忆录中不断汲取力量的。    焦菊隐先生在译后记中，有长长的文字说明自己与这部译作的亲密关系。他在人生最艰难的低谷阶段，靠翻译这本书来寻求精神支撑，从这本书中他看到了从事戏剧这一行当的前途和价值。读这样热情的文字，再回过头去看丹钦科的回忆内容，你会想到翻译不只是一种语言转换，更像是不同文化之间的灵魂交流，就像当年傅雷翻译罗曼·罗兰的《约翰·克利斯朵夫》和《贝多芬传》那样，真正起到振奋人的精神作用。    2022年4月于沪西寓所,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-09/7.htm,5/9/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,韭菜久香,,    小宇    小时候并不爱吃蔬菜，尤其讨厌有怪味道的菜，如芹菜、大蒜、香菜、韭菜等等，成年后认识到各种蔬菜有各自独特的营养价值，强迫自己接受怪味，渐渐地，被动变成主动，委屈变成享受，甚至变得钟情。而最得我宠爱的要算韭菜。    但在国内到处买得到的普通蔬菜，到了德国变成稀罕珍品。1999年我刚到德国时，在城里的亚洲超市看到过一小把中国韭菜，标价是20马克一公斤，吓得我这“好韭”者只能论根购回家杀杀馋虫。    后来去法兰克福，见某中餐馆有“韭菜猪肉蒸饺”。这三个词的组合立马将我的乡愁厮杀大半，赶紧点。可蒸饺上了桌，咬下去大失所望：韭菜似葱花，稀疏零星点缀其中，猪肉倒是满满当当唱了主角。只有在汉堡一家装潢简单甚至有点老旧的上海餐馆，尝到了我在德国我所经历的最赏心悦目最正宗美味的韭菜蒸饺，透过竹蒸笼冒出的热腾腾蒸气，能看到饺皮里一片盈盈的绿，果然入口即鲜香四溢。    某年在法兰克福的女友虹家里，尝到了她在森林里采的野韭菜包的韭菜猪肉饺子。我好兴奋，居然在德国吃到跟老爸做的味道一样的饺子了。至此，我还以为德国野韭菜与中国的韭菜长得相似，散步或骑车在野外，总是在森林草地里寻寻觅觅，可从来没发现过。    十多年前一个五月的周日，邻城纽伦堡的中文学校要组织采野韭菜包饺子活动，我这个半老孩子也激动起来，却路况不熟，开车到了聚集地别人已出发。在餐馆等摘韭菜的家长学生回来，我惊奇地看到德国野韭菜竟像五月铃兰！它在这里长得高大丰满而不失柔美！可吃起来，味道比种植韭菜还浓郁。所以华人把德文叫“熊葱”（Bärlauch）的植物叫作“野韭菜”，通俗易记。当时，那些吃面包奶酪长大的“香蕉人”（喻在西方长大的亚洲人）小朋友也跟我这个有地道中国胃的半路移民一样，被那挡不住的诱惑吸引。多个炉头同时煮饺子都来不及供应，总有托着空盘的大小朋友排队等候在炉边。    为了补偿自己未能赶上摘韭菜的缺憾，在那年自己的庆生日，厚着脸皮向两位好友提出平时不好意思提的“非分要求”：带我去摘韭菜。虽是5月下旬，按德国人说法已过了时令，可我等“韭疯子”不听此说，兴趣依旧盎然。上次采过韭菜的阿萍自告奋勇担当向导；英英则开来加足了油的奥迪车。我们驱车50公里到了Lauf，阿萍却记不起确切的山坡了，四处搜寻不见韭菜芳踪。好在那天阳光明丽，虽没能采到野韭菜，心情一样朗朗。    后来搬去北威州后，还是找不到野韭菜，只能在德国超市买100克1.69欧元的打打牙祭，（今年已经涨到每100克1.99欧元了）!还请野菜专家昔月给我寄过一次。自己也曾去其他城市找文友，作会友加摘菜的特色游。当地一对华人夫妇涛和娟，知道我喜欢韭菜，经常送我他们自种的中国细韭菜，安慰了我的中国胃，温暖了我的中国心。    疫情前搬回先生在巴伐利亚州的小村，今年春天，因了我的执着加幸运，自己在森林里发现了一片绿色，感觉像野韭菜。但怕又错认了相似的有毒的五月铃兰那类，走近细看再揉搓叶片，当一股浓烈的香辛韭菜味袭入鼻腔时，真是欣喜若狂：我20年的寻“韭”路，以亲眼发现，就近可得的骄傲画上了句号。    韭菜，该也是“久”菜，包含长长久久浓浓郁郁的乡情、亲情、友情。在山东出生的父亲生前最爱吃韭菜猪肉饺子。他19岁渡江南下，后因为落户在江南和繁忙的工作，难得能回家乡看望老父母。但只要他做着并吃到韭菜猪肉饺子，如同尝到了妈妈亲手烹制的美味，与父母共度的场景通过味蕾一幕幕重现，身体和灵魂得到双重满足。    如今我在德国，享用着大自然馈赠的野韭菜做的中式美味，仿佛与国内亲人间相隔的千山万水几万公里，也一下子缩短到了“零”。    韭菜久香……    （寄自德国巴伐利亚班贝格）,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-09/8.htm,5/9/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,一人阳性，全楼集中隔离？,市疾控中心：科学判定密接，不搞简单化一刀切,    今天上午10时，上海市举行第179场新冠肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会。很多市民关心，如果一栋楼里出现了阳性感染者，这栋楼居民都要集中隔离吗？怎么做到科学判定密接、次密接人群？市疾控中心副主任孙晓冬进行了详细解答。    密接和次密接（即密接的密接）的判定是流行病学调查专业人员根据国家和本市制订的有关防控工作方案的要求，结合国家专家组的建议以及流行病学调查的结果和大数据排查的信息，来进行综合判定的。    其中，密接是指从疑似病例和确诊病例症状出现前4天开始，或无症状感染者标本采样前4天开始，与其有近距离接触但未采取有效防护的人员，或暴露于可能被污染环境的人员等。次密接是指与上述密接共同居住、工作和学习等接触频繁的人员。    如果阳性感染者为严格静态管理人员（也就是处于严格管理下的非流动性包括足不出户的人员），如果其居所具有独立厨卫条件，那么与其共同居住生活的人员就是密接，而与其同楼层及处于其上下楼层的居民则为次密接；如果其居所不具有独立厨卫条件，那么除了与其共同居住生活的人员为密接之外，与其共用厨卫以及居住在同一楼层或同一村宅的日常有接触的人员也要判为密接，而其所在楼栋/村宅的其他居民则为次密接。但这只是判定的原则，具体还需要根据现场调查和风险评估的结果等进行综合判定，绝不能搞简单化、一刀切。    本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-10/3.htm,5/10/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False

抢人抢货、订航班订舱位……朱骏没想到，专注于技术研发和生产计划的他有一天会被叫作“团长”。每一批货，从订购、装卸到配送，从陆运、空运到海运，物流链条上的每个环节都要亲力亲为。这些货物，是集成电路生产线的“粮食”，是用于芯片生产的各种物料。从3月17日晚上开始，朱骏就返岗驻扎在工厂，以高负荷连轴转的状态，迎接着一波又一波的考验。为统一华虹集团对外口径，协调内部资源需求，他被暂时任命为华虹集团供应链保供团团长，负责4个基地、6条生产线的供应链稳定。    作为集成电路龙头企业，为了保障连续性生产，华虹有一套完备的业务连续性计划方案。3月中下旬，朱骏带领团队开始按照方案急速“奔跑”：紧急发货，一批物料迅速从浙江、江苏等地发出；梳理短板，比如外地槽车司机送货后，需要安排检测机构为他们做核酸；调配人力，梳理出能返岗的员工名单，做好长时间封闭生产准备；密切联系政府部门，申请通行证，关注后续政策的变化……好几个夜晚，他几乎没合眼。担任保供团团长以来，他每日与团队一一排摸供应链“堵点”，寻找解决方案。3月28日，上海分区封控。在有效组织下，华虹6000多名员工，从四面八方汇聚到各个厂区，住宿舍、睡办公室、打地铺，开启驻守工厂的“芯”生活。比起团长的称呼，他更愿意称自己是这“六千分之一”。    短期保供难题逐步缓解，中长期供应链安全如何保障？过去由供应商操心的事，供应链链条上的每一环，现在都要靠华虹一一打通。“我们联络东航物流等相关企业，协调运力，预订舱位，还要负责物料落地后的各项工作，保证全程冷链运输、与海关紧密沟通等。”4月底到5月初，4个架次飞抵上海，十几吨光刻胶在各部门通力合作之下，运往华虹厂区。忙完空运忙海运，与船公司沟通、与港口协调，朱骏已经记不清给多少个相关单位打过电话开过会，不断切换，过关斩将，终于一批批载着芯片生产物料的集装箱动起来了……    除了生产物料，厂区的各项防疫和生活物资，团长也要操心。“我们提前抢购了一批物资，尽全力让员工住好吃好。但客观地说，员工就餐时的品种还是有点受限。”朱骏笑言，疫情期间，他吃得最多的就是韭菜炒鸡蛋和炒萝卜丝、萝卜炖排骨等花式萝卜餐，“韭菜和萝卜我们囤得最多”。    作为团长，朱骏是团队的定心丸。他却坦陈，自己对家人亏欠太多。疫情期间，他的岳母感染了新冠病毒，所幸很快恢复了。当时，妻子既要居家办公，又要照顾孩子，还承担着巨大的心理压力。他却无法在身边分忧。“最近跟孩子打视频电话，要靠哄她才肯好好叫我一声爸爸。疫情结束后，希望能好好弥补家人。”    本报记者  叶薇    坚守2个月，生产核酸采样管原料    5月6日一早，陈飞均从办公室沙发上醒来，第一个来到上海石化合成树脂部号聚乙烯装置。从3月11日起，他和厂区3500多名员工一起，已经在工作岗位坚守快2个月。    夜班师傅看到他说：“来得这么早呀，昨晚生产一切顺利！”老陈走到装置前，详细查看工艺参数。这一天，他们的装置将转产生产核酸采样管的高熔指聚乙烯产品。“这个料熔指高，我早点来，早做转产准备。”    老陈介绍，上海石化在完成原有合成树脂产品市场保供的前提下，根据疫情防控对核酸检测物资的需求，生产可用于核酸采样管、抗原自测管的高熔指聚乙烯产品。截至今年4月底，已经生产了4000余吨。    核酸采样管所需超高熔指聚乙烯专用料此前完全依靠进口。由于国内疫情多点暴发，核酸检测需求不断增加，进口原材料紧缺，经下游厂家试验，上海石化高熔指聚乙烯产品LF5600可替代进口超高熔指聚乙烯产品，生产出的核酸采样管满足各项质量要求，大大缓解了核酸检测需要。    这天上午，他在3条生产线上巡检，这一圈走下来一般要2个小时。老陈说，上海石化的生产一刻都不能停，疫情以来，厂里也始终保持着稳定的原油加工量。3月11日至今，驻守在上海石化的3500多名员工、近1000名改制企业的运保人员和400多名承包商的项目建设人员，在封控期间保持零感染。    疫情期间，老陈最大的感受就是同事之间的沟通交流更多了，更贴心了。“班组里的年轻人待久了，有些焦躁，我觉得都很正常。我就跟他们多聊聊天，看看大家有什么具体困难。下了班，有时候还会组织他们跳跳绳、踢踢毽子。”    本报记者  叶薇    为了大家的“水果快乐”奔走    自4月27日零时起，闭市一个月的西郊国际果品业态，获准分区域、分批次复市经营，市民们的“水果快乐”又回来了。西郊国际果品部经理助理韦贤忠从蔬菜区、配送区的“机动人”回到了自己的岗位，专心供应好上海人的“果盘子”。    “水果是保供第二梯队，我们迫不及待地想回到忙碌的经营场景。”韦贤忠说，现在场内有56名水果客商、17名工作人员，每天200多吨水果在这里交易，包括市郊的西甜瓜、海南的妃子笑、大连的美早樱桃和云南的蓝莓等时鲜货，还有进口的新西兰猕猴桃、菲律宾凤梨和美国甜橙等，约有60多个品种。    为了复市，包括他在内的“西郊水果人”提前做了不少准备，以确保人、货、场的防疫安全。韦贤忠说，56名客商全部来自防范区，已居家隔离满14天，且持有48小时核酸阴性报告。在进入市场前，他们要先做一次抗原检测，在静默区域待足48小时，其间完成2次核酸、2次抗原。一切正常后，才能进入经营区，并开始闭环管理。    进入市场的进口水果则必须持有“三证一单”，即检验检疫证、消杀证、核酸检测报告和报关单，现场再次消杀后经过静默期才能销售。同时，市场采用无接触经营模式，供应商线上接单，线下分拣配送，采购商到场不下车提货。这一套流程都在韦贤忠和同事们的服务和监督下严格完成。    韦贤忠从早到晚奔走在市场里，大到协助办理临时通行证，让客商的货品畅通无阻运抵上海，小到时时巡视，提醒客商正确佩戴口罩，绷紧防疫这根筋。    从3月10日起，韦贤忠已经两个月没回家了。他说，太太一个人带着两个孩子，很辛苦，很对不起她。“5月3日是我小女儿的生日，太太团购了一个蛋糕，我只能隔着手机屏幕，给女儿唱首生日快乐歌。等一切正常，想回去抱抱他们三个人。”本报记者  张钰芸    技术负责人成了“居委会大妈”    “没想到，我从技术负责人，变成了‘居委会大妈’。”当韩雷说这句话时，作为首批回厂的复工者，他已经在厂里住了44天。进厂时穿的羽绒服，已换成了短袖。    韩雷是上海电气电站设备有限公司上海汽轮机厂一员，进厂22年，从基层工艺员做到了技术部工艺处处长。3月23日，厂里决定闭环生产，当天早上通知他“最短时间内进厂”。    上海汽轮机厂共约2800名员工，首批复工300多人，有一线工人，也有研发人员。工厂成立了复工临时党支部，韩雷成了临时党支部书记，忙起各项琐碎工作。“小区遇到的困难，工厂全遇到了，三餐怎么配送，外卖快递怎么传递，洗澡如何分批次，核酸怎么排队，怎么消毒……作为临时总指挥，我就像个‘居委会大妈’，吃住在厂里，整天在‘答疑’和处理紧急事情。”韩雷和同事们制定了《疫情封控期间管理办法》，将千头万绪逐条理顺。    4月19日起，第一批员工陆续复工，至5月5日在厂人员增至850人。厂区提级管理，各车间成为独立单元，就像小区的各楼栋，不能“串门”。厂区分为绿区（生活区）、蓝区（闭环管理区即车间）、黄区（48小时静默区）、红区（应急隔离点），8支志愿者小组负责大门接待、黄区管理、配餐洗浴、核酸组织等，每天都在解决问题。比如，复工以来每天组织抗原和核酸各一次，第一次核采用了4小时，被检测机构“投诉”。工作组就将大家分为“固定组”和“游园组”，改装了检测小车，将时间缩短至2小时。    短暂停摆后，厂区就像一部大机器，慢慢恢复了转动。为尽快恢复产能，制造部门的汽轮机车间、燃机车间驻厂员工每天工作12小时，叶片中心单轴加工中心开启二班二运转，许多员工发挥一专多能，打通工序断点。生产保障部也第一时间到位，保证几百台机床正常运转。当然，面临的困难也不少，比如技术部到岗率只有两成，有时紧急情况要去现场，但进车间要申报非常不方便。为此，韩雷特地派一人驻扎在车间闭环管理，作为技术的“接口人”。    在家庭中的“缺位”，也让韩雷很内疚。妻子是医务工作者，有时要住医院，女儿正上高一，遇到困难打电话给他，他总爱莫能助。“一次打印机卡纸了，我只好远程指导，她倒也自己修好了，我挺欣慰的。”他说。本报记者  金旻矣    “一站到底”，守护电力设备    参加工作8年多的张彦，是国网上海市南供电公司变电运维二班的班长，主要从事变配电设备运行和维护工作，以及承担疫情保电任务。今天是张彦担任班长的第68天，也是驻点值守的第41天。    3月31日，在公司驻岗值守“集结令”发出后，张彦主动请缨，以最快速度来到位于闵行区的一座110千伏变电站值守，召集3名班员组成值守先锋队，为抗疫保供做好“一站到底”的准备，开始不间断值班模式。    张彦赶早制定了辖区内63座变电站的运维方案，对隔离酒店、定点医院、方舱等保障单位涉及的32座变电站制定保电特巡计划，带领值守班员开展地毯式排查，通过带电检测手段全面掌握设备健康运行情况。除变电站日常巡查外，张彦还需随时处理一些紧急任务。一日，一座位于浦江镇的变电站发出“交流过电压”故障报警信号。张彦带领值守小队消除完异常已是清晨。    张彦的妻子照顾着6岁儿子和60岁母亲在封控期间的饮食起居。“家人一开始舍不得。但他们知道我是班长，必须冲锋在前，带着干，领着干，也就理解了。”得知儿子在班级视频活动里将自己抗疫值守保供电的故事讲给同学们听，张彦倍感自豪。    张彦每天关注班里居家人员所住小区的封控情况，并动态更新信息表。作为第一批“赶早人”，张彦带领着最小化运行的班组形成相对模式化的运转机制，为后续值守人员补充、轮换和将来的大规模复工复产，乃至全市的复工复产打下了基础。    本报记者  罗水元    凌晨开工让鲜肉月饼再飘香    随着全市防疫形势的好转，光明邨在5月1日推出两款点心套餐的社区团购，迈出复工复市的新步伐。留守已久的点心师张红燕再次捏起了面团，鲜肉月饼的香味也在店堂里重新飘起。    凌晨2时30分，张红燕的手机闹钟响了。她从行军床上起身，快速洗漱，3时不到就走进了后厨，第一件事是打面。“椒盐饼、黑洋酥饼的面团是冷水发面，先把它们打出来醒发，再去打温水发面的月饼皮。”同事则拌起各种馅料，等到原材料准备完毕后，大家围在案板前，把鲜肉月饼、椒盐饼、豆沙青团、蛋黄肉松酥饼等点心一个个包出来。    在光明邨做了14年的点心师傅，张红燕的手上功夫很是纯熟。“原本店里有近20位点心师傅，但现在驻守在岗位上的只有7人。要保证所有点心当日现做，送到市民手中还是温热的，就必须又快又好。”    清晨5时许，一笼笼青团被送入蒸箱，一盘盘椒盐饼在烤箱中膨胀，鲜肉月饼则50个一组进入铁盘锅开始烤制。店堂里，肉香、油香、芝麻香混合在一起，是上海人熟悉的味道。    8时出头，大部分点心都出炉了，张红燕又马不停蹄地开始打包。鲜肉月饼放进纸盒，豆沙馒头和粽子用袋子扎紧，再一一装进纸袋，等待负责配送的同事取走。    10时许，当日套餐全部送走，张红燕敲了敲酸痛的肩背，准备去补一觉，下午还要做第二天的准备工作。“说不累是骗人的，每一个点心都是手工捏制，费时费工。对于我们四五十岁的老师傅来说，现在更是‘倒时差’工作。但大家‘痛并快乐着’，因为时隔一个月，老顾客又吃上了光明邨点心。”本报记者  张钰芸    把北横通道耽搁的进度抢回来    暂停32天后，超大盾构“纵横号”再次发出了机器轰鸣声，目前以每天2环4米的速度向前掘进，力争把疫情耽搁的进度抢回来。这样的场景，让隧道股份上海隧道北横通道Ⅷ标项目经理孙杰感到，原来熟悉的工作场景正在一点点回来。    今年3月18日至今，孙杰就一直没有回过家。因为疫情，一些生产物资无法运抵，“纵横号”在3月底采取了停机的措施。不过，每天仍有施工人员在井下24小时值班，对其维保和监测，防止产生沉降。    工程进展要顾，近300人的生活、防疫物资也要去联系。孙杰说，当时每天都忙着各处联系，储备应急物资、食材，还要联系医务人员上工地来帮工人做核酸检测。    4月20日开始，孙杰又和同事们开始复工复产前的准备，边张罗生产物资，边对工地整个区域重新划分，商量着如何进行线路规划，可以最大程度避免施工交叉作业。“当时，所有进入工地的临时车辆，都会在车门、车窗上张贴临时封条，司机不下车。随后，验证司机健康码、通行证等信息，并在过渡区完成全车消杀后，才能卸货。”孙杰说。    在囤够一周生产物资后，5月2日“纵横号”开启复工复产之路。“之前，‘纵横号’已在北横东段掘进了350米。”孙杰说，之后，它还将穿越运营中的地铁18号线和4号线，完成总计2800多米的东段“地下之旅”。    5月4日，一车从嘉兴海盐运来的盾构管片抵达工地，这让孙杰兴奋不已。“这说明生产物资的运输通道已经打通，将为后续的工程提供生产条件。”孙杰说，工地的人员复工率已达83%。为了减少人员流动，每天的施工人员加管理人员精简到76人，分成六个班组。每个班组的生活、工作，甚至吃饭、上厕所都有固定路线，不能交叉。    复工后，孙杰这些天更忙了。昨天中午，孙杰抽空给家里人打了个电话。声音听上去极其疲倦的他告诉记者：“我的太太是上海儿童医学中心的护士长。我们互相调侃，一个是抗疫先锋，一个是复工先锋。”    本报记者  裘颖琼    加油员配送员联络员一肩挑    早上7时，王喜庆从地铺爬起来，活动了下身体，迅速洗漱，穿上工作服、戴上防护面罩、口罩和手套，进入工作状态。他本是一个睡眠很好的人，但连续四五十天的地铺生活，让他变得睡眠很浅，夜里要醒好几次。    王喜庆是中石油上中加油站经理，在加油站已经干了16年，却从未在站里待过这么长时间。从3月8日开始，他驻守加油站，保证服务保供不打烊。这两天，加油站有2个小伙伴回家了，又有2个小伙复工了，而他还要继续坚守。    王喜庆做出驻守加油站决定时，疫情形势并不明朗，公司也没通知。连续有几名员工接到居家隔离的通知，他赶紧返回家中收拾换洗衣物，赶回站里。“当时我就一个想法，自己绝不能被封控在家中，最关键的时刻必须在站里，和员工在一起，保证加油站正常运营。”他迅速准备了一批防疫物资，采购了行军床、睡袋、春秋被等一批生活物资。行军床翻身困难，大家就干脆打地铺。在他的带领下，加油站的工作有条不紊地开展。站里还开辟了医疗救护、消防、公安等车辆的绿色加油通道，为防疫、值勤和环卫等人员设置“爱心驿站”。    王喜庆还是闵行、徐汇11个加油站的支部书记。上海分区管控后，这11个站的员工到岗率锐减，也面临着物资紧缺的情况。他申请到一张宝贵的物资运输通行证，开始当起了11个站的联络员和配送员。这些站点一圈跑下来，往往也要大半天。他还经常跟这些站点的员工视频沟通，协调解决各站经营困难，帮助员工排解心理压力。    站内员工越来越少，最困难时只有3名员工在岗。王喜庆上了夜班又顶白班，一个人就是一个班组，有段时间每天只能睡几个小时。他不仅要保障站内运营，还为附近的小区居民送民生物资。“我们有一些线上渠道可以采购到物资，最多时送过20多个小区，看到附近居民拿到我们送去的菜，就很有成就感。”    王喜庆也不知道驻守加油站的时间还需要多久。他很怀念，疫情前自己在地铁车厢里摇摇晃晃1个多小时到家，推开家门听孩子叫一声：“爸爸，回来啦。”    本报记者  叶薇,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-10/4-5.htm,5/10/22,第4/5版:上海新闻,,False
病危爸爸在内蒙古思念儿子  母亲哭诉机票、车票订不到,绿色通道开启  母子登上高铁,,    求助    为了给3岁半的儿子看病，今年3月23日，我带着孩子从内蒙古呼和浩特来到上海交通大学医学院附属第九人民医院治疗，手术后已住院40多天。孩子的病虽然治好了，但不幸的消息传来：他的爸爸在呼和浩特市的医院被诊断为淋巴瘤晚期，已在ICU抢救9天，七天七夜处于昏迷状态。我迫切希望尽早赶回呼和浩特，让孩子能看看爸爸。  内蒙古呼和浩特  杜女士    帮忙>>>    火车票终于买到了    在电话连线中，记者进一步了解到，杜女士已和丈夫离婚，但他们都很疼爱儿子，为了给孩子看病，爸爸几乎倾尽所有。刚得知儿子病快治好了，病魔却将爸爸击倒。4月20日起，杜女士不断接到前夫病危消息：淋巴癌晚期，癌细胞已经扩散。“前些时间，他爸爸每次打来电话，就说想见见孩子，然后就是一阵阵揪心的痛哭。最近，他被送进了ICU抢救，医院说他已经昏迷不醒了。”说到这里，杜女士连声抽泣，“我没日没夜地在网上抢机票，但每一次好不容易订着了，航班又一次次取消了。想改订火车票，又一直订不着。我现在真不知道该怎么办……”    听完杜女士的话，记者立刻通过相关渠道向上海铁路部门发出求助。下午3时许，经过努力协调，上海铁路部门为杜女士办好了5月9日下午前往南京的高铁票。    票是有了，但母子俩又如何从黄浦区的制造局路赶到上海虹桥火车站呢？“这件事，我们必须帮！”在记者向大众出租汽车公司讲述了母子俩的遭遇后，相关负责人当即承诺，“明天下午1点，车子一定来接。”    的哥为孩子买点心    昨天下午2时许，在大众出租的运力保障下，杜女士顺利抵达上海虹桥火车站。车站工作人员随即开通“绿色通道”，帮着母子俩搬运行李，安排休息室候车。下午4时30分，杜女士带着儿子乘上了G7376次列车。    在列车上，杜女士给记者发来了几段她自己特意录制的视频，激动之情溢于言表：“出租车司机还给孩子买了点心，火车站对我们十分照顾。希望孩子的爸爸能够挺住，更希望所有的好心人一生平安！”    多次转车旅途闭环    今天上午9时许，杜女士发来消息，她和儿子昨晚6时30分抵达南京南火车站。在严格落实各项防疫措施后，被闭环转运至车站内宾馆休息。早上，又被闭环转运至车站，等候今晚9时许前往西安的Z86列车，再经西安闭环转车后抵达呼和浩特市。在严格执行隔离措施后，父子俩就能见着了。  本报记者  王军    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月9日11时至5月10日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求244件，其中紧急类诉求122件，已推动解决106件（含“公益联盟”17件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-10/6.htm,5/10/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,一夜等罢头飞雪,,    彭瑞高    近两个月，小区常有些事情口口相传，这是发生在南区、传得最多的一件。一名正当盛年的男子，刚在医院遭遇丧父之痛，才把父亲送进太平间，却又接到疾控电话，说他核酸异常。这时他是什么心境？又会怎样选择去路？    他开着车，眼前一直浮现父亲的遗容。那张苍白的脸，他在床边凝望了两个星期，早已深深刻进心底。父亲患急性白血病，4月9日进的医院，苦于疫情，医院没有相关门诊和手术；他是看着父亲像盏油灯那样，一天一天油尽灯灭。他无数次呼唤父亲，此刻仍在呼唤……    半月来，他独自一人在医院照料父亲，没人来替换过他。他现在想见到两个女人——母亲和妻子。他要告诉她们，父亲临走前的一切；他还要跟她们商量，大疫临头，怎么操办父亲的后事。他还渴望见到宝宝。父亲临终前就想见见宝宝。如果不是封控，他会把宝宝抱到床前，让父亲最后看一眼。孩子还不懂事，如果他踏进家门，第一句话问他：“爸爸，我爷爷呢？”那时，他怎么回答？左邻右舍，到时也会来问他：“爷爷好吗？”他该怎么回答？    想起那么多邻居，他心里蓦地升起一阵温暖的感觉。他还记得父亲发病那天，自己匆匆离开小区的情景。那些天，他刚被邻居们推选为弄堂“堂主”。小区很大，有近千住户，像他这样的“堂主”有几十位，属于志愿者领头人。每次核酸检测，他都要排好时间，叫好住户，不让检测车前人群聚集；每次抗原检测，他都要发放试剂，收集结果，上报医生；每次募捐，他都要线上动员、线下收款，还要带头捐款（这次他刚捐1500元）。最忙最累也最热闹的，是分发政府“大礼包”。那天他会开车到大门口，把各家礼包都装上，然后送到每户门口。分发这礼包时，弄堂就像过节一样，一扇扇玻璃门后、一只只口罩上方，是一双双笑着的眼睛……    小区、弄堂、隔壁邻舍……想到这些，他心里忽然一紧。半个多月没回家，小区微信群他却天天看。北区疫情基本控制住了，南区也继续保持着一片净土；小区还没解封，但“清零”之声已隐约可闻。这两字的发音，是多么好听啊。为了这两字，南区北区差点割裂，两千多芳邻苦苦相守……    他打开右转灯，在路边慢慢停下。他觉得自己不能再往前开了。不要说疾控通知他核酸异常，就是正常，他也觉得自己不能进小区。毕竟在医院里待了那么长时间，要是带上病毒怎么办？传染自家妻儿不算，还要贻害左邻右舍，这是人做的事吗？    他把车开进停车场，找个车位停下。他用手机告诉疾控中心自己所在位置，然后放下座椅，躺平身子，静候医生来做核酸复查。几小时后，医生赶来取样，告诉他，请耐心等待复核结果。他还是等在车里，喝一点矿泉水。他预感正确：疾控后来通知他，核酸复核结果阳性。他怔了一下，疲惫多日的全身，反而一下子松弛下来。他依然等在车里。医生说，会派救护车过来，把他转运去方舱医院。    这一等就等久了，直到那辆闪着警灯的救护车开到他身旁，他才推开车门。这时他已等了一天一夜。他下车后向东方望了一眼，天边晨曦微明。这就是人们所说的黎明吧？    一夜等罢头飞雪。他发觉，自己这一夜老了许多；但又觉得，这一夜值得。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-10/7.htm,5/10/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,朴实真挚的刘子枫,,    汪正煜    真不敢相信，刘子枫走了。走得那么仓促，那么突然，令人还来不及写一篇回忆和他相聚时的文章，他就不告而别了。曾经想去拜访他，和他再谈谈表演，谈谈电影，谈谈书法，可是因为难以预料的疫情，一切都无法如愿，一切都只能在消逝的时间中留下痛楚和遗憾。    我和子枫相识是在电影《假女真情》中。电影导演武珍年选了一批好演员，仲星火、魏宗万、奚美娟、刘子枫等都已经是成名的角儿。子枫和奚美娟演一对夫妻老丁和王玉娟。这是个非常普通的家庭。正因为普通，所以他们两人的表演也非常地“普通”，非常生活化。在家里两人一边烧饭，一边说台词，根本不在演戏。镜头没拍多少，有一天，摄影瞿家振对奚美娟说：“你这部电影可能会得金鸡百花奖。”我推推家振：“你看子枫的戏，也非常生活。”瞿家振的话一语中的，果然，奚美娟凭这部电影荣膺双奖。我和摄影家振是好友，事后我们也谈及刘子枫，他说，子枫在影片中戏份不多，但他是陪衬红花的出色绿叶。    刘子枫个子不高，无帅哥相貌，那已经头发稀疏的脑袋，更无法和当今那些美女帅哥媲美。可是他凭的是演技，那精湛的演技叫人不能不心悦诚服。我在学生时代就省下不多的零花钱，去看过他演的列宁，并为之惊叹，认为和上海人艺的高崇实演的列宁各有特色。他的成名作是《黑炮事件》，这是中国电影史上经典之作。在剧组时，我和子枫谈过这部电影，他告诉我，拍摄之前，看了剧本，他就痛哭不已，拍摄前也做了许多准备，为演好一个普通人有许多想法。普通的一个工程师，丢了一个棋子“黑炮”，引出一场惊天动地的大事，这黑色幽默完全通过朴实的表演演绎了出来。我表示叹服，可子枫用上海话说：“我额角头高啊！”“碰到这么好的导演和这么好的创作班子……”    我在《假女真情》中担任副导演，拍戏现场要协助导演工作。有一回，主演奚美娟从家里出门喊他丈夫的镜头，刚要开拍，我急忙制止。导演问，为何？我说，她在门外的镜头，前几天拍摄时是戴着围兜的，现在这镜头没带围兜，将来接不上。影视剧的镜头不是按情节顺序，而是按场景拍的。导演马上叫场记查，果然是这样，服装连忙为之改装，再拍。事后，子枫笑问：“你老早看出来了吧，在等导演喊开拍再阻止的吧？”我忙道：“岂敢岂敢，真的是开始没发现啊！”他拍拍我肩膀：“你真的很认真。”我又说：“都是跟你学的嘛！”他大笑……    往事如烟，历历在眼前。斯人已去，其声犹在耳畔。    我和刘子枫还有共同爱好，书法。不过，他写草书，我则练隶书和行书。我很奇怪，他这位个子不高者，竟能书写如此高啸狂歌、富有豪情的草书，而且和杨在葆在草书书法中结为挚友。我曾询问，他笑而不答。古语曰，人不可以貌相，海水不可斗量。此之谓也！    已经到了立夏季节，轰轰隆隆的春雷也已经滚滚而去。上海，我们的母亲城市经受了难料的磨难。曾想等疫情结束去拜访子枫，谈谈艺术，谈谈书法，可这一切成了梦幻。抚摸岁月，渡过漫长的河流，我们在时间里寻找回忆，在时光中逆行着跨越苍老。或许你主宰生活，或许让生活主宰你。刘子枫在告诫，我们还是要主宰生活！仅以此文，悼念朴实真挚的刘子枫！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-10/8.htm,5/10/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,不想您孤零零，我们的老伙伴,从饮食起居到看病配药，关爱独居老人，关注每个细节,    优先送物资    24小时在线受理来电    “阿婆，家里的菜还够吗？身体情况怎么样？”居委会主任黄静，正拿着一份社区独居老人情况排摸表，一一拨打每位老人的电话，耐心细致地询问老人生活情况。“社区里所有独居老人的基本情况，其实我们心里早就有底了，但每天还是要定时打电话了解他们的最新状态，如果他们有特殊需求和困难，我们就能第一时间掌握。”    打完电话，居委会决定把新到的一批生活物资优先送到独居老人手上。    很快，清点、分配好物资后，几位工作人员穿上防护服带好物资，从居委会出发了。封控、静默中的小区此刻显得格外寂静，只能看见社区工作者和志愿者奔忙的身影。他们一趟趟来回穿梭在楼栋之间，有的忙着巡查各楼栋秩序；有的骑着三轮车、电瓶车挨家挨户分发物资；临近午饭时间，还有的忙着把热气腾腾的助老餐送到老人家里。    “林阿婆，我们带了一些蔬菜过来，有花菜、白萝卜、西葫芦、上海青，还有桃酥、奶粉、蜂蜜、罐头……”看到各种物资占满了桌子，73岁的林阿婆惊喜地说道：“太感谢你们了，真的是及时雨，前些天买的菜快要吃完了，正愁要怎么办呢，你们就来了。”告别老人时，工作人员不忘叮嘱老人：“电话号码还留着吧？有什么事情第一时间打电话给我们哦！”    不到1小时，36位独居高龄老人悉数收到了这份物资补给。在工作人员的耐心安抚下，封控、静默期老人们的心理焦虑也随之消退。“有什么事情就找居委会干部和志愿者，他们和家人一样，有他们在，我感到很放心，相信疫情会很快过去。”83岁的林松麟对记者说。    “小区封闭、静默管理期间，对独居老年人等特殊人群的关心关爱和服务保障，是我们社区工作的重中之重。”据了解，静安区彭浦镇万荣新苑居民区60岁以上老年人有2358人（90岁以上老人67人），占实有人口的38%以上，其中独居老人家庭143户、纯老家庭338户。对高龄、独居、行动不便的老年人，社区通过电话等方式联系，及时了解掌握情况，帮助老年人开展核酸检测登记，协助送餐和配送生活物资等。    同时，很多“老伙伴计划”志愿者们与结对关爱对象每天通一个电话，通过“远程陪伴”提供关心关爱，24小时在线受理老人和家属的来电。针对封控管理期间社区老年人的一些刚性需求，如助餐、居家护理、配药等，居委会在严格落实防护措施的前提下，尽力提供一对一上门服务，想方设法做好社区特殊人群的服务保障工作，让老人安心、放心居家。    本报通讯员  黄小清  记者  江跃中    紧急120送医    三班倒贴身照顾24小时    七旬老人已经几天没有吃居委干部送去的盒饭，身体虚弱瘫软……5月7日中午，给老人送饭的杨浦区五角场街道复旦居委会干部看到这一幕，赶紧拨打120，并联系老人的女儿。没想到，老人的女儿竟然执意不肯赶来照顾父亲，甚至关闭了手机。怎么办？居委干部在街道办事处支持下，决定挺身而出“代女尽孝”，不仅垫付了送到医院后的几千元医药费，还三班倒24小时贴身照护因为神志模糊随时可能拔掉输液管的老人。幸而，经过复旦居委会和老人女儿住所地居委干部的共同努力，一天半之后，老人的女儿终于现身医院，不过，居委干部对老人的关心并没有因此画上句号。    这位老人是一名独居老人，身体状况不是太好，居委干部一直挂心着，4月1日封控前，已联系他女儿安排助老餐送上门。虽然女儿只为他支付了一天的饭钱，居委干部们仍然坚持每天从自己的工作餐里省下一份给老人送去。5月7日，居委干部上门时看到，老人开门时的状态已经可以用有气无力来形容了，身体软绵绵的，神志模糊，桌上摆着好几份没吃过的盒饭，情况十分危急。居委干部赶紧拨打120，同时联系其居住在宝山区的女儿。    其实，从封控以来，居委干部已经几次为老人拨打120，救护车也几次来到小区门口，却都因为其女儿不肯出面而不了了之。这一次，老人的女儿态度依然没有改变，仍然反复询问着“我没有车怎么过来？”“你们派车接我去医院，那我怎么回去？”“出来以后，我不能回小区怎么办？”……却只字不提父亲的病情。    居委干部们心知女儿因父母离异等原因与父亲有心结，但救命的关头容不得等待、犹豫。情急之下，几个人分头行动，有的准备随车同去医院照顾老人；有的讲亲情摆道理劝说其女儿；有的联系其女儿住所地居委会，为处于封控区的她争取办理通行证明；有的联系街道安排专门车辆准备去宝山接其赶往医院。然而，忙碌了一个多小时后，她关机了。    居委干部们心一沉：怎么办？此时，老人的血压正快速下降，刻不容缓，街道驻点干部邓海琳和复旦居民区党总支书记李霞萍简单讨论了几句，当机立断：“人命关天，居委干部顶上去！”    随即，居委会副主任陶敬熙与一位街道下沉干部穿上防护服，钻进救护车，在鸣笛声中驶向长海医院，抵达医院时，老人的血压转而上升到了220mmHg！幸而，一圈检查做下来，再加上输液等救治，老人的精神好了一些。就在陶敬熙一直紧绷的神经想放松一下的时候，恢复了一定行动能力的老人竟突然伸出手，试图拔掉身上的输液管。陶敬熙赶紧一边安抚老人情绪，一边控制老人行为，等老人情绪稳定下来，二人早已累出一身汗，但因为医院环境特殊，又穿着防护服，两人从傍晚坐上救护车一直到午夜离开医院，连一口水都没喝过。    8日中午，居委干部终于再次打通了老人女儿的电话，到了晚上，她坐上五角场街道安排的专车，姗姗来迟现身医院，而此时，已经有3名居委干部轮流在病床前代她照顾老人超过了24小时。    3天过去了，老人的生命指征仍不稳定，至今只能通过鼻饲进食。居委干部们仍在挂念着这位虚弱的老人：不仅安排保洁人员把老人原本踩不进脚且有异味的家里打扫整理了一番，为他在医院里安排了一对一照顾的护工，还找到了一家护理院，建议其女儿今后将生活难以自理的老人送去专门机构养老……一场可能发生的悲剧得到了化解，而这样的“顶上去”，其实，正是社区一线工作人员的日常。    本报记者  孙云,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/4.htm,5/11/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,绿叶菜新鲜  奶蛋肉齐全,公益联盟为多名高龄老人送去“特需口粮”,    “牛奶鸡蛋肉都没了，缺少营养，屋里向的老人家真是撑勿牢了！”连日来，多名高龄老人家属向“新民帮侬忙”发来求助。    “老伯阿婆的事情，阿拉必须帮！”“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟的小伙伴又接下了“让老人补补身体”的特殊需求单。公益联盟企业百联集团旗下联华超市迅速送达精心准备的专属礼包，菜肉蛋奶一应俱全。“牛奶喝上了，肉炖上了，绿叶菜炒上了，鸡蛋煮上了！”在记者回访中，电话里传来家属们欣慰的话语。    子女开出“特需菜单”    家住杨浦区杭州路66弄的陈先生告诉记者，父母均已80岁，患有癌症和心血管疾病，小区封控后，他们不会网购，街道、居委会、好邻居通过团购配送的“口粮”有时不合老人的口味。“阿爸姆妈每天只好顿顿吃青菜、面条，人都瘦了快10斤了。他们现在最最缺的就是牛奶、鸡蛋！”心急如焚的陈先生为父母开出了“菜单”。    宝山区菊泉街55弄的王女士和外婆、母亲同住，90岁的外婆去年因突然摔伤成了植物人，需通过胃管进食，70岁的母亲则是腿部残疾、行动不便。小区封控后，居委会一直来电关心，还派人每天上门送餐。“但外婆这种情况，只好靠阿拉喂米汤、蔬菜汤等流质食物，现在外婆能吃的绿叶菜快没了，阿拉又不晓得到哪里去买，谢谢侬帮帮阿拉好吗！”话至此处，王女士几度哽咽。    家住宝山区吉浦路615弄的顾女士表示，95岁的母亲身患多种疾病，但家中也是“营养口粮”断供。此前，她曾尝试通过社区团购“补仓”，但是因为小区里老人较多，不会线上操作，没办法成团。“绿叶菜、猪肉、包子，这是阿拉姆妈最想吃的。”电话中，陈女士急求“特需菜品”。    “专属礼包”度身定制    记者将求助信息发至“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟群，公益企业百联集团旗下联华超市随即和孝顺儿女、孝顺外孙女取得联系，工作人员在详细记录下一连串特殊需求后，立刻给相关门店发去“菜单”，给老人们度身定制了“专属礼包”。同时，考虑到陈先生和王女士生活境况比较困难，为他们提供了水果、猪肉、鸡蛋、牛奶、酸奶、大米、食用油组合。另外，他们也为顾女士备好急需的绿叶菜、猪肉和包子套餐。    5月9日，联华配送员给老人们送去了“特需口粮”。“阿拉中午就烧了一桌子菜！”“伊拉晓得我要帮外婆擦身体，还送了两袋白醋！”“绿叶菜、水果覅要太新鲜哦，阿拉姆妈看着直笑！”……一段段发来的短信，晒出的是开心，传递的是温暖。    据联华超市市场营销中心相关负责人赵凌介绍，4月21日起，百联集团就依托旗下联华超市开启“百联暖春行动”，为残障人士、社区80岁以上独居老人和特困家庭推出三款平价套餐（米+调味品、油+面+调味品、日用品套餐），一单起送；同时针对困难家庭的特定需求，全力以赴协调解决。目前，公司已累计帮助1500多人，其中包括多位百岁老人。残障人士和高龄老人如有需要，可通过热线电话962828、企业微信等渠道即时告知。“我们一定会竭尽所能，助力特殊人群走过艰难。”赵凌表示。  本报记者  房浩    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月10日11时至5月11日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求327件，其中紧急类诉求153件，已推动解决119件（含“公益联盟”19件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/5.htm,5/11/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,心中之谜终得解,,    叶辛    进入三月份，疫情逐渐严峻。我集中精力读的一本厚书《茶叶和帝国》足足有50万字，这不是一本小说，而是历史学教授埃丽卡·拉帕波特写的一本和茶叶有关的作品。    我在当知青的年代里种过茶、采过茶，也跟着农民炒过茶，贵州乡间称为挼茶。成为作家后，写作时唯一的陪伴就是一杯茶。文人之间交往，送来送去是两样东西：书和茶叶。2015年，贵州省委、省政府聘我任贵州茶文化大使，除了品尽产自贵州各地山乡里的茶，赴各地和作家们一起采风，对全国各省的种种名茶我也分外关注，去过六安瓜片的产地，到过信阳毛尖、古丈毛尖、都匀毛尖的核心产区，安溪铁观音为首的几款福建茶，上海附近的龙井、碧螺春、黄山毛峰等全国十大名茶，后起之秀如遵义红、普安红、湄潭栗香茶、风冈锌晒茶、翠芽、黎平侗乡的茶等等，不仅一一细细品过，多多少少讲得出一点道道。我写过十几篇和茶有关的小文，读过国内好些茶专家写的和茶相关的书和专论，唯独没有读过外国人写的茶书。    这本《茶叶和帝国》竟然是专著，之所以津津有味地一章一章细读，于我而言，是希望开拓视野，解答心中之谜。茶叶的祖先是中国，但是外国人为什么把茶文化做得风生水起？任茶文化大使，我年年要参加研讨会，和国际、国内的茶专家在会上切磋探讨，我不能重复一个话题。在一般上海人心目中，只要讲起茶叶，会自然而然提及英国人的下午茶（不少英国名作家作品中都涉及）。其实，英国由于地域、气候和历史的原因，本土没有茶园。但是，英国人把茶文化几乎做到了极致。当然，茶的价值也大大地提高了。    贵州全省现在有700万亩茶树，茶乡、茶坡、茶园，一望无际的茶海，我看了一个够。但是各族老乡在脱贫攻坚、在乡村振兴的过程中，大多只知道把茶叶种好、采好、加工好，虽然效益和品质也是明显的，但还有相当的提升空间。就是在三月中旬，我趁回去开会的空档，到侗乡、苗村、布依族寨子故地重游，碰到不少浙江茶商，他们都是来山地上采购茶叶的，而且纷纷夸赞，贵州偏远乡间的茶又好又便宜。    《茶叶和帝国》这本书，追溯了从加拿大西部至印度东部茶叶帝国的兴衰，涉及了和茶叶有关的众多话题，茶叶与妇女、茶叶和战争、茶园、茶企、加工和茶叶的交易市场，以及各种各样和茶叶有关的活动，揭示了茶叶和喝茶的生活习惯对当代世界的塑造作用。我在认真阅读的过程中，有不少收获和结合中国、结合贵州茶的思考。    读到书中《茶叶让世界精神焕发》这一章时也颇为认同。喝茶对人的健康有益，几乎是世人的共识。自然，对上海人也是有益的。    2020年7月，江苏文艺出版社出版了我的长篇小说《魂殇》；今年上半年，作家出版社即将出版我的另一部长篇《婚殇》。听说我在写《恋殇》，有出版社找来，说希望能给他们。因为《恋殇》内容和前两本书不太一样，开春以来，我把广有盛誉的三本爱情小说，又读了一遍。这三本书是《情人》《相爱一场》和《爱情生活》，都是我收藏的老书了。    今年的新作我也读了几本，有两本书是108岁的老作家，也是我的忘年交马识途先生的新作：一本是《那样的时代，那样的人》，另一本是《马识途西南联大甲骨文研究》。和马老相识相交40年了，他在青年时代学习的专业是甲骨文研究，我从来没听他说起过。可见马老的为人和品格。记得40年前他主动赠我书法作品一幅，调回上海以后，我把他的字幅送出去装裱，人家见老作家的字写得这么好，当场开出五万元之巨的价格要收买。这个小细节，我从未向外界披露过，写出来和读者共贺马老健康长寿吧。    顺便带一句，我还认识一位曾给我的小书写过序的酒界泰斗秦含章老人，活过高寿111岁。虽然他已辞世，他为我的酒书《解密黔台酒》写过序，是我的枕边书，我也时常温故而知新的，为这篇序，秦老写下三首诗、两幅书法，我时常带着欣赏学习的心理，捧读一下。    为给我多年前的水族老朋友张加春的散文集《乡村生活》写序，我把这本书也从头至尾读完了。我还真正从他朴实的叙述中，读到了全国唯一的水族自治县三都的乡村现状和民俗。特别是对乡村的未婚男子、留守老人和儿童，有了崭新的认识。这本书由中央党校出版社出版之后，很快被中宣部推荐为农村各级干部的必读书。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/6.htm,5/11/22,第6版:夜光杯,,False
,大家的“爱心青年团”,,    殷健灵    1404的小校友：    青山一道同风雨，交往无须频繁，相距半个世纪的校友可在一日之间飞到身边。谢谢你们，当我们身处困境时，送来了热忱的帮助……    写下纸条的是瑞南新苑2号楼独居老人90岁的严凤霞和93岁的唐云祥，小校友“潘潘”是该楼栋爱心青年团的成员之一。一场疫情，将彼此面熟陌生的邻居牵系到了一起；短短一月，这个有着97户常住居民的楼栋能自发孕育出一个特殊的民间组织：爱心青年团。    说是青年团，成员并不都是年轻人。发起人江红和洪韵，一位是前上海蒙牛乳业有限公司总经理，一位是上海人民广播电台经典947主持人，江红企业家出身，性格热情行事果断，洪韵则温婉知性善良有爱。青年团的几位团员，有的是公司财务和人事主管，有的是边开宠物店边教古筝的多才多艺的音乐老师。用江红的话说，年轻不在于生理年龄，而在于心理上的永葆青春。    4月7日，江红发现家里的绿叶菜不够吃了，进了小区的大群团购。住在楼下的洪韵对江红说，几次团购下来，她发现她们所在2号楼的订单是整个小区最少的，她猜想很大一部分原因是老人多。独居老人、空巢老人如果没有同住的年轻人协助，不会团购的他们将怎样扛过这段日子？江红不敢想。她建议洪韵，我们自己来建一个群，专门帮助楼里不会网购的老人，至少，要让老人家吃上牛奶和鸡蛋呀！两人一拍即合。之后，又邀请了几位热心小伙伴加入，各司其职：在公司负责人事和财务的处女座小伙伴负责做团购明细表，开宠物店的古筝老师负责制作团购链接，身处非封控楼栋的小伙伴负责接团和分发物资……    不久，爱心青年团带动了整个楼栋，“不落一户”的2号楼爱心群建立了，江红出面联系平价质优安全的源头品牌，牛奶鸡蛋水果、手抓饼零食，以及消毒用品……洪韵随时准备着在爱心群里为老人家团购答疑解惑，如何改自己在群里的昵称，如何下单，还一遍遍播放自制的团购步骤示范视频……爱心青年团搜集了整个小区的独居和高龄老人名单，2号楼居民团购了，别的楼栋的独居和高龄老人也同时收到了爱心早餐和水果。    洪韵在群里发起一个倡议：捐献爱心红包，并且规定，每户金额不超过十元。十元，似乎微不足道，但理由很足：“我们是爱心群，不是走过场的献爱心，要让所有的邻居参与进来，无需攀比，而是在需要的时候，让爱心得到延续。”五一节，感谢为大家服务的居委和物业工作人员；驻守2号楼的大白志愿者要调离了；给小区里的独居老人赠送爱心早餐……需要大家献爱心的机会不少，每次一经倡议，整个楼栋都会响应。有邻居嫌十元太少，想多捐，爱心团说：“不行，这是规矩。”爱心确实不是金钱多寡能衡量的，他们看重的是：爱心能落到实处，能长久地绵延。    邻居们何尝不是捧着一颗爱心呢？大白十几天没洗澡了，邻居们纷纷捐出自家的水桶、热水瓶、烧水壶、洗发水、沐浴露；驻守封控楼栋的大白要调离了，大家又是自发募集资金，表达感谢……    当物质的需要得到满足，邻居们更需要精神上的纾解和抚慰。来一场云上爱心音乐会吧！爱心青年团又谋划了一场别开生面的云上爱心音乐会。古典音乐节目主持人的洪韵自然成了策划人和组织者。果然，音乐会激起了很多老人的期待。4月22日晚，成为2号楼的不眠之夜。十岁的孩子弹琵琶《茉莉花》，85岁的奶奶独唱《梭罗河畔》，京剧票友唱《智取威虎山》，洪韵自己则唱了一首《小情歌》。洪韵的爸爸为了上节目，整整练了两天的小提琴，录了一遍又一遍。“爸爸有事情做了，特别上心，特别开心。”洪韵说。    那晚的音乐会持续了三个小时，邻居们意犹未尽，“表情包都不够用了”，而对大家来说，原先只在电梯间碰到的邻居们对彼此有了新的认识，新的发现，这是一次前所未有的凝聚。    爱是能量，也是星火。如今，小区别的楼栋更多的邻居加入了“爱心青年团”。“‘爱心青年团’不会随着疫情的结束而结束，会延续下去、壮大下去。疫情只是我们相遇的开始。她已经走出2号楼，走到了整个瑞南新苑，将来，也能从瑞南新苑走出去，将爱无限地传递。”这是爱心青年团的美好愿望。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/7.htm,5/11/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,负重40斤爬楼　消杀队也是“攀登者”,,    早晨一起床，中国红十字（上海）防疫消杀志愿服务队队员钱庆在做完核酸检测后，和队友换上防护服、背上消毒设备，奔赴徐汇区康健街道紫薇园小区开展当天的消杀服务。    根据中国红十字总会和上海市红十字会的指令，从4月24日起，中国红十字（上海）防疫消杀志愿服务队已先后前往浦东新区周浦镇、徐汇区康健街道等地连续开展防疫消杀作业。    这支队伍共有14人，其中既有红十字会专职工作人员，也有来自各行各业的红十字志愿者。队伍有一定的灾害救援或大型活动服务保障经验，但这次防疫消杀作业有着“别样”的艰辛——    “医用防护服+两层手套+脚套+头套+面屏”二级防护标准的“大白”之下，是闷热的体感，早已湿透的衣服，被泡得发白的双手双脚，还有肩背上被勒出的一道道印子。许多居民楼没有电梯，队员们需穿着密不透风的防护服，背着40多斤的消杀装备，在楼道里爬上爬下，逐层消杀，包括垃圾桶、电梯轿厢、门把手等重点部位和区域。必须确保消杀无死角、全覆盖。    在周浦镇“城中村”，由于环境复杂，队员们在消杀作业中时常还会面临防护服被勾破而暴露的风险。有时候遇到涉阳严重的楼道，应当地居委要求，还要反复多次消杀。尤其是在高温日，着实是对体力和毅力的极大考验。    面对这些困难，队员们毫不在意：“都是身强力壮的小伙子，这点辛苦不算什么。况且我们已经是‘熟练工’了！”为了给自己打气，队员任思祯还在防护服背面写上了“胡歌迷弟”，希望“隔空喊话”演员胡歌，一同为家乡上海加油！    和许多疫情防控志愿者一样，这段时间，他们不得不暂别父母妻儿，吃盒饭、睡行军床，每天早出晚归。队长高博家就住在徐汇，4月30日，他们转战徐汇区康健街道推进消杀工作的第一天，恰好也是他儿子出生满8个月。虽然离家很近，但重任在身，他还是选择了坚守岗位，“过家门而不入”。而副队长单鸣华家中，还有80多岁的母亲需要照顾。于是，每天一早准时通过手机App帮家里“抢菜”，成了这些上海队员们照顾家人的特殊方式。    “有天我们出任务归来，在营地整理装备，隔壁小区楼栋的阳台上，忽然出现了一位老婆婆，看到我们身穿大白，开始还有些紧张，然后我们就告诉她，我们是消杀队。老婆婆就特别高兴，边为我们鼓掌边说谢谢。”一名队员回忆，这是他感触最深的一个场景。    截至5月9日，上海队消杀面积已超270万平方米，其中涉阳楼栋618栋。“每天都要负重爬几十层楼，至今队伍已相当于登顶上海中心大厦33次。”副队长单鸣华说。    本报记者  郜阳,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-11/8.htm,5/11/22,第8版:综合新闻/广告,,False

,疫情走势趋稳向好  反弹风险依然存在,老旧小区、城中村等重点风险区域继续推进拔点攻坚,    今天上午10时，上海举行第181场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。市卫健委通报，5月11日，上海新增144例新冠肺炎本土确诊病例和1305例本土无症状感染者。144例本土确诊病例中，38例在闭环隔离管控中发现，106例为无症状感染者转归确诊病例。1305例本土无症状感染者中，1303例在闭环隔离管控中发现，2例在相关风险人群筛查中发现，这2例也就是在防范区筛查中发现的。    新增感染者人数整体呈下降趋势，在隔离管控外发现的新增阳性感染者越来越少，社会面疫情风险得到有效控制，疫情走势趋稳向好，但反弹风险依然存在，老旧小区、城中村等重点风险区域还要继续推进拔点攻坚工作，决不能掉以轻心、麻痹大意，决不能让持续向好形势发生逆转，让各方艰苦努力前功尽弃。根据筛查结果，5月11日全市共划分封控区5973个，涉及人口约197万；管控区17472个，涉及人口约303万；防范区49313个，涉及人口约1829万。  本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-12/3.htm,5/12/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
我不知道你的名字  但我知道天使就在身边,今天，致敬“提灯女神”,,    ■目前全市共有护士10.87万名    比2017年增加了2.47万名    其中    30岁以下的护士占39.17%    中高级职称护士占20.4%    男护士占2.79%    ■在此次疫情中，全市10万余名护士、外省市援沪的1.6万余名护士，在抗击新冠疫情阻击战中发挥了生力军作用    ——据今天上午举行的市疫情防控新闻发布会    岁月静好的平凡岗位上，她们用爱带来温暖，守护生命；疫情肆虐的披甲前行中，她们挺身而出，为护山河无恙。她们也是普通人，没有什么理所应当，只因穿上了天使的衣裳，从此闪耀爱的光芒。    今天是第111个国际护士节。有些节日或许意味着休息，可对于白衣天使而言，担负着救死扶伤的责任，并不会在这一天减轻。    一位位步履匆忙的护士，正是在用各自的默默奉献，守护着千千万万个家庭的幸福安康。白衣执甲、逆行出征的担当、不让须眉、冲锋在前的勇毅，守“沪”生命、无私奉献的情怀，构筑起当下大上海保卫战里坚不可摧的防线。    今天，向护理战线上的天使们真诚道一声：“节日快乐，感谢有你！”    援鄂老兵    点亮“南丁格尔之灯”    席丽君和张艳，两位曾在武汉雷神山医院感染三科“战斗”过的护士长没想到，两年后，在上海新国际博览中心方舱医院，又一次成了“战友”。    “我有抗疫经验，让我去！”本轮上海疫情发生后，申城各医院号召广大医务工作者积极报名参加支援方舱医院、定点医院医疗队，龙华医院风湿免疫科护士长席丽君和上海岳阳医院心胸外科护士长张艳都第一时间报名。    面对和雷神山一样的“白手起家”，两人多了一丝从容；而曾经援鄂的经历，让这两位“老将”不自觉成了年轻护士眼里的主心骨。4月2日晚，两人各自所在的医疗队完成开舱准备，当一辆辆满载感染者的大巴鱼贯而入，她们又站上最前线，尽力让收治变得更有序，让病人觉得更安心。    后来，根据安排，国家援沪医疗队进驻新国博方舱医院。席丽君所在的龙华医院医疗队完成长宁绥宁路方舱的建设后，又转战金山天华路方舱医院；而张艳跟随岳阳医院医疗队来到了虹口纪念路方舱医院。    一手拿着对讲机、斜挎自制的小包，在龙华医院医疗队接管的两个舱里，总能看见席丽君在四处奔忙——收治病人、发放餐食、“一老一小”的关照、特殊患者的照料……尽管方舱医院收治的多为轻症或无症状感染者，但该做到的护理细节一点也少不了。“援鄂归来后，我对护理工作制度、各班岗位职责、患者收治流程有了自己的思考，并在上海抗疫中得以运用。”她回忆，“记得有一夜，凌晨2点有近300名患者入院，正是有了有序组织和完善的流程，一个小时不到就将大家安置妥当。”    入驻虹口纪念路方舱医院的第三天，上海气温飙升至33℃。方舱医院设施比较简陋，尽管“大白”们第一时间从后方调配了风扇，可仍有病人变得焦躁。“天气这么热，孩子怎么睡？”有个妈妈拉着女儿向护士抱怨。张艳见状，拿了些奥利奥饼干和果汁递到她手中，“这些给孩子吃，这儿条件确实比不得家里，我们也在尽全力想办法解决，请您多多谅解。”张艳边解释安慰，边带着母女俩回到床边，帮着取出被芯，重新铺床。事实上，闷在密不透风的防护服里，“大白”们同样不好受。张艳的付出，病人们都看在眼里。后来，那个小女孩和张艳成了朋友，经常拿出画笔，邀请“大白”阿姨一起画画。    都说“三分治疗，七分护理”。护士是医生的“眼睛”，也是值守在病床旁的“哨兵”。“每次走过病床，看到一张张脸庞，眼神中有期盼、有焦虑、有感动。我想让他们放心，我们会努力战胜疫情，努力救护好每一位患者。”张艳说，她和护理团队一直在做的，就是在患者心中点亮“南丁格尔之灯”。    00后小将    并肩战斗是最好的成人礼    5月，对于曙光医院和华山医院的两位“00后”护士刘庄凤和喻馨来说，是个节日颇多的月份，过完劳动节、青年节，今天又要迎来护士节。在定点医院和方舱医院里度过第一个属于自己的节日，让她们有了不一般的感受。在上海本轮疫情中，还有许多像她们一样的“00后”护士，在“疫”线的历练中成长，展现出蓬勃的青春力量。    有一种勇敢，是明知艰险，也绝不回头。一句“我愿意”，让刘庄凤这个去年夏天刚踏出校门的护理“新兵”，成了曙光医院医疗队里的“老幺”。进舱的前两天，她在驻地酒店度过了自己的22岁生日。过生日那天，她对着生日蛋糕许愿：“能跟前辈们一起并肩战斗，是白衣天使的责任，更是最好的成长礼。”    刚工作不久，就跟随医疗队先后支援方舱医院和定点医院，刘庄凤有了很多难忘的第一次。“第一次穿上防护服，有种奇妙的感觉，瞬间感到自己的肩膀上多了一份责任。”她告诉记者。和方舱不同，定点医院收治的患者病情更重，还有不少老年人。很多老人都是独自入院，没有家属陪伴。这时，刘庄凤还要帮他们喂饭、换尿布。“我还负责照顾需要定期做血透的患者，每天忙碌而又充实。”姑娘说。    在临港方舱医院里，华山医院00后护士喻馨从舱内的留言墙上，发现了医患合力抗疫的小秘密——    有段时间她负责夜班值守。夜深时，空阔的舱内渐渐安静了下来，只有呼噜声和一些若隐若现的手机亮光作伴。借着微弱的夜灯照亮，她从一张张病床旁走过，看到没盖好甚至落地的被子，总会忍不住一遍遍捡起来，轻轻盖好。这样的小事本不觉得有人在意，直到发现舱里的爱心墙上，一封患者留下的匿名信：“因为焦虑，心里抵触舱里的一切。却因为睡眠浅，几次看到了守夜的‘大白’帮我盖被。这些孩子那么小，应该还没做母亲吧，将心比心，这份关爱何尝不是融化冰雪的暖阳？于是便渐渐理解、接受了这里的一切。”忽然，她觉得有一股暖流回荡在胸口。    随着临港方舱适老化改造，老年患者日渐多了起来。对于没有自理能力的老人，护士们精细护理，喂老人吃饭。喻馨记得有位奶奶总喜欢反客为主，先问一句“小姑娘你吃过了哇？”直到响亮地答复她“吃过了，您放心！”她才会满意地开动起来。    有人会说，“‘00后’还是孩子，还需要被人帮助”。刘庄凤的回答是，穿上防护服，自己有着和前辈们一样的勇敢和坚定，在被需要的患者面前，我必须独当一面，撑起那份属于自己的责任；而喻馨在日记里写道：“身为医护人员，在疫情这个战场，冲锋在前是一份责任使命；而身为青年，能在刚一参加工作就有锻炼自我的机会，意义非凡。我细细体会着舱里的这些点滴，涓涓细流汇聚磅礴力量。我更加坚信，上海一定会早日恢复原本的模样！”    坚守一线    “超饱和状态”下挽救生命    “急诊原则上不停诊，保障血液透析等科室连续性服务”，对病人来说，这是疫霾笼罩下，自己想要伸手紧紧抓住的一道光；而对坚守在急诊、血透室的医护人员来说，要付出比往常多出数倍的艰辛，既要尽力堵住潜在的感染风险，又要在“超饱和状态”下挽救每一条生命——毕竟，此时来到医院的病人，很多都是在家扛到没法再拖的。    这场“战疫”里，无数护士留给孩子和家人一个背影，昼夜兼程赶回岗位上。陈皎是新华医院急诊重症监护室和抢救室的护士长。前几天，她收到了8岁儿子发来的信息：“老师布置了作业，要采访家里的职业人，妈妈，我想要采访你。”从3月底起，陈皎就一直没有见过儿子。作为护士长，她必须闭环在医院里，守着责任重大的两个阵地，刚刚过去的母亲节，儿子只能在视频的另一端，给她一个隔空拥抱。    急诊抢救室护士长就是这里的“管家”——既要协同医生参与救治，又要协调管理区域内的防控工作。面对着接诊量的激增，陈皎带领着护理团队反复调整急诊流程，严格把控各项防控措施。疫情以来，新华医院急诊始终处于开放状态，承担了大量的急危重症患者抢救任务，接收的急诊救护车次每日攀升，最高日救护车次达65辆，在抢救室的留观患者最高人数达到79人。面对巨大的工作压力，陈皎像“救火队员”一样投身其中。她已经习惯了每天工作十几个小时的连轴转甚至连续无眠的状态……遇到危重患者，她总是冲在前面，把年轻的同事护在身后；面对情绪焦躁的家属，她总能专业细致耐心地安抚解释……    抢救室的护士有30多位，急诊重症监护室的护士有20多名。陈皎告诉记者，这里有很多青年，包括很多年轻的妈妈，护士们处变不惊，既要救命，又要安全，还要有爱。她说，感谢家人，尤其是儿子对自己这份工作的理解与认可。    上午8时，仁济医院血液净化中心护士长李萍穿上防护服、进入血透室、装透析仪器管路、准备好机器、为病人进行治疗……对尿毒症患者来说，一台台血透机、一条条连接的管路，就是延续的生命线。    不久前，68岁的赵老伯突发急性左心衰，呼吸困难、咳嗽不止，不立即进行血透治疗的话将有生命危险。接到电话，李萍顾不上休息，立即赶往病房。穿上防护服，测量生命体征、血压、心率和体重，进行血透。2小时后，赵老伯的心衰症状缓解。“后来我们了解到，赵老伯最近自我管理有些松懈，饮食上没控制住，突发了心衰。”虽是普通一件小事，也让李萍记忆深刻。    李萍已经近两个月没有回家了。2000年参加工作，2010年成为血透室护士，李萍即将迎来职业生涯中的第23个护士节。“从事这份职业以来，难免会碰到这样那样的困难。但是挽救了生命时的职业自豪感，是其他职业无法提供的。每当我们成功抢救了一个病人，挽救了一个生命，或者说帮助到一个家庭的时候，所有的辛苦和累，包括委屈都是值得的。”李萍说。    核酸采样    居民配合理解付出就值得    “抬头，张嘴巴，很快就好。”核酸采样时，这样的轻声细语，相信你我都不陌生。本轮疫情发生以来，很多护士一直坚守奋战在核酸检测一线，相比护士服和燕尾帽，她们用防护服包裹自己的时间更长。无论周末还是节假日，清晨抑或是深夜，在一个个临时核酸监测点、在一栋栋楼宇里，都能看到她们坚守的身影。张雨和骆文婷就是其中两位，在她们看来，每一位市民的积极配合和理解，就是送给她们最好的节日礼物。    从最初为密接、次密接上门采样，到后来筛查时坐上三轮车在社区“摆摊”，上海市东方医院护士张雨已经记不得自己参与过多少次核酸采样了。疫情刚发生时，需要为混采阳性的市民做单管复核，那一次，张雨跟着采样队伍，在联系好居委会后上门挨家挨户采样，从中午忙到了第二天凌晨。那一次忙完，很多队员吃饭时手抖得厉害，连胳膊都抬不起来，但现在，早就习惯了的张雨已经能轻松应对每一次任务了。    这位工作不到一年的姑娘记得最牢的，不是辛苦，而是工作中收获的感动——在花木街道采样的那天，风雨交加，志愿者早早为采样队员们搭好了帐篷，还贴心准备了马甲御寒；老小区里的老人行动不便，她们需要上门采样，爷爷奶奶一声声真诚的谢谢，眼神里藏不住的对晚辈的那种心疼，这些都让张雨感觉到，自己的辛苦付出是值得的。疫情下，张雨每天的工作紧张忙碌，需要不定期外出采样、需要在科室值班、需要护理阳性感染者，姑娘说，觉得护士这份职业非常神圣，选择了它就会热爱它，值得自己用一生去做好。    骆文婷是静安区彭浦镇社区卫生服务中心的护士，最近她的主要任务是和同事们一起“追阳”和“查漏补缺”。“前期筛查已经把点位情况摸了个遍，现在要到一些楼内把漏采的人群补上，通常老弱病残较多；还有一些需要单管复核的，也要上门。”对她来说，尽管工作强度没有前阵子那么大了，但对体力的要求一点不少，因为很多老公房没有电梯，上门采样就要不停地爬楼。    不久前，她参加上门核酸采样工作时，为了躲避路口突然出现的骑手小哥，不慎摔了一跤。她说，当时想着有三栋楼需要上门采样，心里比较急，只是检查了一下防护服有没有破损，就没有多想，马上拿着采样物资上楼了。任务结束回家后摸了摸肿胀的小腿，才发现擦伤了好几处，但在工作时竟然完全感受不到痛。    采样过程人人都知道“辛苦”，骆文婷说，居民的一句“谢谢，辛苦了”让她感到欣慰。作为一名基层卫生工作者，骆文婷说：“一次次的抬手、一天天的步数，就是基层卫生工作者的‘成绩单’。希望早日迎来抗疫的胜利，能看到大家口罩背后的笑脸。”本报记者  郜阳

98岁残障阿婆的床单湿了换、换了湿公益联盟相助后女儿喜极而泣,10大包尿不湿来了  姆妈能睡安稳觉了,,    求助    我的母亲98岁，住在浦东新区灵山路1671弄。老人双目失明、肢体残疾，常年卧床不起。疫情期间，我70岁的哥哥、60多岁的妹妹日夜照料母亲。但由于小区封控、物资紧缺，老人一个晚上至少要更换5张的尿不湿已全部耗尽，又无处“补仓”，床单只能是湿了换、换了湿。为此，我们一家人焦虑万分，不知该如何是好。  市民  包先生    帮忙>>>    在前天的新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，包先生进一步表示，自没了尿布后，妈妈痛苦得不得了，“阿哥和阿妹整夜不敢睡觉，吃力得不得了；阿拉小区封控，我又帮不上忙，急煞了！”接下包先生“急购尿不湿”的求助后，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟小伙伴胡琪四处查询，终于在网上找到了货源。但一听价格，包先生叹气：“买勿起，买勿起，阿拉屋里向的经济条件实在是……谢谢侬，阿拉还是和老人一起再屏屏……”    “不能让阿婆再吃苦头了！”公益企业美团听说包先生家的遭遇，立刻站了出来。工作人员迅速调配物资，在前天下午，把10大包成人尿不湿送到了包先生母亲所住的小区。    “收到了！收到了！真是太感谢了！”在昨天的直播回访中，包先生的妹妹喜极而泣：“看到妈妈天天这副样子，我跟阿哥的心痛得勿得了，现在总算好了。”随后，包先生的妹妹又向记者发出新求助：“现在屋里向老人家能吃的东西真不多了。伊牙齿勿好，只能吃软一点的大米，还有土豆、番茄……”    “阿姨，侬覅着急，这个忙阿拉一定帮到底！”记者随即又向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出信息，将这一串详细记录的“特需菜单”列入公益企业百联集团旗下联华超市的“百联暖春行动”帮扶名单。阿婆的米会有的，阿婆的菜也会有的！    本报记者  徐驰  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月11日11时至5月12日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求325件，其中紧急类诉求130件，已推动解决105件（含“公益联盟”17件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-12/6.htm,5/12/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,怀念秦怡老师,,    简平    5月9日一早，得到秦怡老师仙逝的噩耗，心里真的沉沉地静默了。回想四年前的3月2日，我也好，秦怡老师也好，那时候见面是无限欣喜地大叫的。    那天是元宵节，上海文艺界在文艺会堂举行新春茶话会，来自全市文艺界的艺术家代表欢聚一堂，共贺戊戌新年。戊戌是狗年，所以，茶话会从每一轮本命年属狗的人中选了一位代表，上台去致辞，并接受各个门类的艺术家们精心准备的礼物。我是代表上世纪50年代的“狗”，而那天最大的“狗”是96岁的秦怡老师。我临上台前，特意先跑去秦怡老师那里——我们40年代到90年代的“狗”都坐在一张圆桌旁，秦怡老师因为坐轮椅，而且还坐在主桌，所以没和我们在一起，也不上台致辞。我跟她说了句“悄悄话”：“秦老师，一会我上去时，您想让我说些什么啊？”她笑了笑，对我说：“你就多喊几声‘汪汪’好啦！”于是，我心领神会，在台上大声地叫了八声“汪汪”，当然不是学狗叫，而是“旺旺”。我边叫边望向秦怡老师，她也正看向我，还对着我拍手。    其实，那天秦怡老师身体不太舒服，她原本可以不来参加活动的，但她觉得大家都盼着在狗年能看到属狗的她，她不想辜负大家的一片心意，所以她对文联和影协的同志说，我去参加吧，再说她住在华东医院，与文艺会堂仅隔一条马路。那天，她把自己打扮得满身喜气，粉红色的外套，长长的红色围巾，头上戴着的一顶绒线帽也是红黑相间，尽管她比之前瘦了好多，但还是显得很精神。    这就是秦怡老师，她这辈子的人生并不平坦，充满坎坷，但她总是心怀坦荡，从容面对。当时，她刚刚拍完陈凯歌导演的《妖猫传》，她在电影中饰演白头宫女，这个角色因最后之死而震撼人心，不过也有人说她不该去演这么一个人物。秦怡老师听到后淡然一笑，我心里想，只有真正的艺术家才会明白戏里的决绝也是一种现实人生。这就可以理解她为什么会在90多岁高龄还去青海，忍着高原反应，坚忍不拔地完成了她电影生涯中最为特殊的一部影片——《青海湖畔》。    这部电影是秦怡老师自己编剧、主演的，以青藏铁路建设为时代背景，讲述了以一位女气象工程师为代表的科学家们，在高原上克服重重困难开展科考工作的故事。秦怡老师告诉我说，她是听到一个真实故事后才萌发拍摄这部电影的想法的，她确实是全身心地投入，因为她想通过电影，传达她自己对事业、对国家、对人民的一份忠诚。我去看了片子，她问我感觉怎么样，我向她伸出四个指头，“四个字。”她催问我是什么。我说：“秦怡品质”。    秦怡老师走了，我们热爱她的人无法为她送行，我只能在心里静默着，怀念她，永远地怀念她。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-12/7.htm,5/12/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,慢慢领悟的幸福,,    戴民    前阵子，曾涂鸦小文《幸福的男人有三个“妈”》，那自足溢于言表。可天下没有满满当当的事。疫情封控，正轮到妻子在闵行照料年迈的岳母，封在那里不能回家；女儿，单位指定值班，近在咫尺也指望不上。幸福的男人霎时成了孤家寡人。女儿是跑新闻的，嗅觉灵敏，离家时，买了一堆食物，扔下话：可能要封控，你熬熬。熬算啥？这是你老爸人生字典里的常用字，放心！    头一回自己解决一日三餐。早餐，牛奶面包加鸡蛋；午餐，方便面加荷包蛋；晚餐同午餐。三天拷贝不走样，蛋白质足够，熬一天是一天。第四天起床，对着镜子，陡然发觉面色一如蛋清，胃也跟着犯酸，望着剩下的半桶牛奶，冷不丁一个嗝。吃得如此狼狈，发餐图给老婆和女儿叫苦，遭来两个“小姆妈”一脸坏笑，这回尝到离开我俩的滋味了吧？    解封假以时日，这深深刺痛男人不会做家务的软肋。清早，斑鸠在自家露台树枝上“咕咕”鸣叫，仿佛嘲笑困在家中懒得起床的我，眼看余下日子，油盐酱醋、锅瓢碗盆、洗洗换换，一切都得自己打理，不禁愁上眉头，浑身瘫软。    活了大半辈子，没正儿八经做过一顿饭、洗过一回衣服，一切家务都由老婆承担，饭来张口，衣来伸手，这倒不是男主外、女主内使然，而是一直以来整天忙的就是一个顾不上家的职业，习惯了，彼此墨守成规。看朋友圈，真叫人眼馋居家的日子，爱要奋不顾身，吃要挖空心思。我以前的搭档，做得一手好菜，人家也是男人。哎，羡之深，恨之切。    做家务，老家称过光景，也叫过日子。一个不会料理家务的男人，这日子怎么过？家中两个女人，平素待我像老妈，男人一直像被裹在襁褓里的孩子，也许幸福过头，陡然离开那两女人，感觉自己像棵草，风来了，匍匐在地，雨淋了，簌簌发抖。但即便是棵草，也得顽强生长，家务活就这点事，想做，难不倒咱爷们。想通了，抖擞精神，要善待自己，一切从头来过。    那日，放下大老爷们身段，和老婆视频通话，请教家务活从何做起？女人还真心细，卷筒纸、洗衣液、垃圾袋、米面油盐等等，先告诉你日常用品搁在哪里，然后教你怎么煮饭，微波炉、洗衣机怎么用法，初次培训，已让男人头昏眼花，平日看人家挑担不吃力，身临其境方知难。老婆在视频那头大呼小叫：方便面少吃，冰箱冷冻室有肉，切得细些；天暖了，隔夜食物勿要吃！男人斯文回答，子曰：食不厌精，脍不厌细。食  而，鱼馁而肉败，不食。懂的！视频那头又气又恼，只会翻嘴皮子，动手试试？    居委会送来蔬菜。是夜，韭菜炒蛋，将就弄个水煮肉、白米饭。此刻，最想吃老婆做的炖蛋，那滚烫稀薄的蛋花，淋上酱麻油，用调羹送入嘴巴的一瞬间，蛋花穿过齿间，鲜烫绕于舌尖，简直将人提振起来。    打蛋，调匀，放入葱花，加少许盐、鸡精，加水，搁锅子里蒸煮，不就是这点活，自己动手也能做。一支烟工夫，起锅，傻眼，蛋花像烤糊的大饼，中心塌陷，周遭凝结，干瘪瘪得似抹桌子的揩台布，这就是传说中的“夜糊蛋”吧。老婆电话那头一听大笑，不懂了吧？炖蛋要用温开水调匀，所以，嘴巴覅老，虚心点，家务活学问大着呢！    转眼封控一月多，在女人的调教下，日子也过得蛮滋润的。疫情当下，还是多往好处想想。比如，这个城市空气清新如涤；对大多数像我一样不会整家务活的男人，无疑被逼着学会了“婆婆妈妈”，总算也是收获，离了女人的男人，即便是一棵草，景明春和也好，风吹雨打也罢，幸福总是在生长中慢慢领悟。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-12/8.htm,5/12/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,松江“白名单”企业超87%复工,规上企业复工率超九成  复工总数位全市前列,    随着疫情防控形势趋稳向好，不少企业迎来了返岗员工，有序复工复产。    厂区内生产线开工不停歇，会议室内则铺满行军床……位于松江经开区的正泰电气股份有限公司，被列入上海市第一批重点企业复工复产“白名单”内。目前，一线员工复工率已达七成，园区内有约2000名员工闭环生产生活。    一家数千人规模的大型企业，要闭环做到防疫与生产两不误，正泰电气股份有限公司党委书记陈成剑坦言“有压力”。为此，公司也做好了防疫消杀、生活保障等相应措施与预案。    “我们企业就像是一个大社区。疫情发生前，员工大多居住在生活配套区、工作在生产区，上班只需步行七八分钟。”陈成剑介绍，复工复产以来，为了便于管理，公司采购了大量行军床，一线员工统一安排吃住在生产区，一日三餐有食堂配送，相当于企业园区内又多设了一个“小闭环”。    员工的日常健康监测必不可少，目前企业安排大家每天抗原筛查、隔天核酸检测。为了让核酸采样更高效，公司还选了4位管理人员“兼职”采样，他们经过培训考核后已经持证上岗。    陈成剑告诉记者，公司产能现已基本恢复到七八成，赶工的智能制造类订单，主要来自国家电网、方舱设备与其他基础设施建设。    “疫情发生后，我们的供应链基本断了。幸好，在市、区相关部门的支持下，我们现在有4张跨省通行证。”陈成剑告诉记者，正泰在嘉兴设了一个中转基地。松江与嘉兴同属长三角G60科创走廊，车程仅1小时不到。“我们把生产好的产品送过去，再把原材料拉回来，以此解决物流难题。”    在上海回天新材料有限公司，员工正按照防疫规定陆续返岗。董事长章锋告诉记者，目前公司复工率已达75%。在防疫不松劲的同时，大家都铆足了干劲：“我们公司的产能达到了200吨/天，产量已经超过同期。生产线也从一开始的两条，到如今4条线开满。”    如今，市、区、镇三级“白名单”制度已在松江建立；“复工复产防疫通”平台的上线运行，也帮助企业员工“一码返岗”，企业车辆“一码通行”。记者从松江区经委了解到，截至目前，三级“白名单”的2200多家企业已累计复工近2000家，复工率超87%；其中，“白名单”内的规上企业复工率已超90%，复工总数位列全市前列。本报记者  杨洁,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/3.htm,5/13/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,为啥我的快递还没到？,,    “前两天，我们小区门口突然来了四五百个中通的快件！”家住闵行区的马女士对此表示惊讶，她猜想这些快件都是前一两个月积压的。家住闵行区的陆女士在京东上买的生活物资，迟迟不到，哪怕物流信息显示已运到昆山，也还是“再次进入睡眠状态”；但家住普陀区的陈先生却说：“京东的东西都能送到，牛奶、大米、奶粉都到了。”    这也是目前许多上海市民的困惑：快递复工到底进展到哪一步了？为什么别人能收到快递，而我却不能？    上海市邮政管理局副局长余洪伟在5月12日的疫情防控发布会上介绍道，目前，上海邮政快递行业揽收和投递业务量日均值均已达100多万单，恢复到常态水平的1/6；同时，将在近期公布第二批邮政快递业复工复产“白名单”企业。    16家分拨处理中心恢复运营    我们这里所说的“快递”，专指传统的跨城快递。5月8日，上海市邮政管理局发布第一批复工复产“白名单”企业，邮政、顺丰、中通、圆通、申通、韵达、极兔、菜鸟、京东等21家快递物流企业，都在首批“白名单”之内。    公告称，希望在符合防疫要求的前提下，各相关部门、各属地街镇和园区对“白名单”企业及其下属分支机构、网点在复工复产期间遇到的复工申请、员工返岗、交通运输、核酸检测、集中住宿等各类诉求，予以统筹协调解决。    记者了解到，进入上海市邮管局首批“白名单”的21家快递企业中，已有16家分拨处理中心恢复运营，5家分拨处理中心也拟于近期投入运营，采用的是封闭式管理方式。但网点的复工需要当地相关部门批准，目前末端网点的复工还比较谨慎。    “目前来看，上海的跨城快递，主要堵在派件网点未开和派件快递员还没有全部返岗这两个‘点’上。”一位快递业内人士告诉记者，比如极兔速递，上海转运中心已开始复工复产，但收件网点恢复占比大约是超20%，派件网点恢复占比大约是30%。    链路一“点”不通就无法送达    消费者刘女士最近有点焦虑，因为“收快递”这件事让她摸不准“规律”：“我在电商平台上买的大米，一式两份，订到普陀区自己家的，已经送到了，订到浦东新区父母家的，物流信息却显示还未发货。同一天网购的东西，已经过去一个月了吧，空气炸锅用的铝锡纸前几天已经送到了，但火锅底料却一直在往后推迟配送时间……”    相信很多市民都有同样的遭遇和疑问。其实，跨城的传统快递要走通，经过的链路比较复杂，一般要经过以下多个“点”：发货人（地）-揽件网点-区域分拨中心-另一区域分拨中心-派件网点-收货人（地），只要其中一个环节遇到“肠梗阻”，你的快件就无法送达。    “假设个人买的东西从外地突然显示揽件了，就说明收件地附近的网点开工了。”一位快递业内人士解释道，收件地附近的网点只有申请了复工，“三段码”才可以开，意味着发件网点就能把单子打出来了。但至于能不能成功派送到收件地的小区，还需要看负责该地区派送的快递小哥是否已走出封控小区返岗，有时还要看小区是否能顺利收件。    不同的快件，涉及不同的发货地、不同的承运快递企业、不同的收货小区，即便是一个快件，也要涉及到多个环节，且疫情下各环节会出现诸多不确定因素，所以才会产生“有的小区能收快件、有的小区却不能收”“这家快递公司的快件能收到、另一家快递公司的快件却收不到”等不同情况。    退件重新下单或可提升速度    进入5月中旬后，邮政快递业复工复产的步伐明显加快了。目前，部分快递公司此前积压在上海的个人散件将逐渐恢复派送，但主要运力仍以保障重点保供物资为先。例如，中通数十万件封控前滞留的积压件基本清点完毕，会根据所在区域社会面疫情情况及网点、快递员复工进度启动派送，并为已复工商家、机构提供揽收服务；圆通在上海已有部分网点复工复产；极兔目前复工主要是散单为主，派送此前积压的散单；德邦空运线路货物已开始恢复寄递业务，转运场也已逐步恢复，散单已恢复派送。    而对于消费者来说，宅家逛逛网店，看看自己已买东西的物流信息，也成了每天的必做“功课”。需要提醒消费者的是，目前快递公司的主要运力仍以保障重点保供物资为先，所以网购物品也尽量选择生活必需品，咱们再忍忍，等疫情全面结束、快递完全恢复后，再买其他非必需品；如果网购的必需品下单已一两个月了，还没发货，也可以选择退掉“老件”，重新下单。“很多平台之前积压的订单实在太多了，新订单是即时下发处理，老订单要分批插队处理，所以新订单送货的速度更快。”一位业内人士透露。    复工复产仍有不少堵点难点    有市民会问：“到底什么时候快递能彻底恢复？”根据上海市邮管局的动员部署，本市将分保供、保通、保畅三个阶段积极稳妥逐渐有序开展复工复产工作，其中第三阶段即保畅阶段，要等社会经济秩序逐步全面恢复，快递行业将全面开放分拨处理中心和营业网点的运营，全面恢复寄递业务。    上海市邮政管理局副局长余洪伟在5月12日的疫情防控发布会上介绍道，为了统筹疫情防控和行业复工复产，近期上海邮政快递行业主要抓了两方面工作：一是有序释放运能运力，截至目前已发放了全国重点物资运输车辆通行证、市内防疫保障（物资运输）通行证1万多张，办理了邮政快递公司寄递人员电子通行证1.5万余张。二是做好防疫安全，管好人、车、邮件快件。    余洪伟表示，邮政快递业复工复产涉及链条长，受当前疫情形势，及上游平台、干线运输和末端网点恢复情况不一等多重因素影响，行业复工复产仍存在不少堵点难点；有些区域网点主要承担保供前置仓功能，承担防疫物资、紧急药品和生活必需品的投递工作，有些网点以生产生活资料和关系国计民生的产业链供应链为服务保障重点，主要满足已复工复产的企业用户、集团用户和政府用户的运递需求，这些网点目前暂时无法为个人用户提供收寄服务。    余洪伟说，下一步，要尽可能多地恢复处理中心和营业网点的运营，尽可能快地全面恢复个人寄递业务，为市民提供更好的服务。    本报记者  金志刚,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/4.htm,5/13/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
教师资格认定将截止  材料迟迟“送”不出沪,邮政“突击队”接单  重要材料跨省送达,,    求助    我在上海工作的这几年中，通过坚持不懈的努力，终于取得了自己老家湖北省咸宁市的教师资格证书，而最后一门普通话测试是今年刚刚在苏州通过的。按照规定，我必须返回咸宁市办理教师资格证书的认定手续。考虑到疫情影响，咸宁市同意可由亲属持本人相关材料原件代为办理。但我四处询问，多家快递公司都表示无法送达邮件。眼看着截止日期将至，自己多年的辛苦可能付诸东流，我愁得夜不能寐。浦东新区康桥镇  陈女士    帮忙>>>    陈女士告诉记者，自己是过了笔试、面试、普通话这“三关”后，好不容易取得教师资格证书。但最后，还必须取得咸宁市相关部门的当面认定，如果错过5月18日教师资格证认定最后时间，意味着6月20日过后所有成绩将被作废。按照目前情况，面对疫情封控、交通管制，“跨省寄件”似乎成了“很难完成的任务”。    收到求助后，记者随即向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出信息。不一会儿，陈女士就收到公益企业中国邮政集团有限公司上海市浦东分公司康桥邮政支局的回复：“我们帮你送吧！”5月11日下午，邮政人员身着防护服，赶到陈女士所在的小区揽收快件。“他们对我说，一定能在18日前送到。我一听，整个人马上就好了。我还把取件过程拍了视频发给爸妈，他们也特别高兴。”回访时，陈女士仍抑制不住心头的激动。    上海邮政浦东分公司康桥邮政支局营业部经理姚青向记者介绍，自3月24日所在区域实施封控后，康桥邮政支局由17位同事组成的“突击队”一刻都没有停歇，目前又召回部分员工，“突击队”扩充至27人。一方面他们协助属地镇、居委会做好抗疫物资的分发，一方面还要保障辖区内重要领域重点企业重要快递快件的揽收和投递。而对于市民急件的快递，“突击队”也是“能帮一定帮”。当记者代为转达陈女士的谢意时，得到的回复简简单单：应该的，这都是应该的。    本报记者  王军    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月12日11时至5月13日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求273件，其中紧急类诉求137件，已推动解决109件（含“公益联盟”16件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/5.htm,5/13/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,离我们更近的黑洞“写真”来了！,未来，科学家还打算给黑洞拍小视频！,    本报记者  郜阳    三年前，人类拍摄的首张黑洞照片亮相；两年前，诺贝尔物理学奖将当年奖项的一半授予了发现银河系中心超大质量的致密物体的两位科学家；而现在，我们看到了第二张黑洞照片，这个黑洞，离我们更近。    北京时间12日21时07分，在包括上海在内的全球七地同时召开的新闻发布会上，事件视界望远镜（EHT）合作组织正式发布了银河系中心黑洞人马座A*（Sgr   A*）的首张照片。这是该组织继2019年发布人类第一张黑洞照片后的又一重大突破。相关成果12日以特刊的形式发表在《天体物理学杂志通信》。    在参与研究的中国科学院上海天文台科学家们看来，这是一张期待已久的关于银河系中心的大质量天体的真面目肖像——此前，天文学界普遍认为人马座A*应该是一个超大质量黑洞，但毕竟只是基于数据推测，而这一成果“实锤”了该天体就是黑洞，为理解这种被认为居于大多数星系中心的“巨兽”行为提供了宝贵的线索。    1    科技进步    得窥“庐山真面目”    科学家此前已观测到众多的恒星围绕着银河系中心一个不可见的、致密的和质量极大的天体作轨道运动——在上世纪70年代，天文学家通过美国绿岸射电干涉仪探测到对应银河系中心黑洞的致密射电源。此后，人们对该致密射电源提出了不同的命名，但最终只有人马座A*这一名称经受住了时间的考验而被人们接受，这也暗示被称作人马座A*的天体很有可能是个黑洞。    先来回顾一下黑洞的知识：黑洞是引力极强的时空区域，任何东西，甚至光都无法逃逸。黑洞不发光，因此我们看不见黑洞自身，但绕转的发光气体给出了它存在的信号。给黑洞“拍照”，实际是拍摄到黑洞的“阴影”。    要知道，银河系中心受到强烈的星际散射的影响，想要一窥“庐山真面目”，得靠在（亚）毫米波段的观测。随着近年来在深空探测工程中屡立新功的VLBI（甚长基线干涉测量）技术以及观测设备的发展，科学家们对Sgr A*开展了一系列的高辨率观测。    就我国科学家而言，中科院上海天文台研究员沈志强牵头的国际团队在20年前就利用他国的VLBI对Sgr A*开展了首次的高分辨率成像观测，并测量到Sgr A*在3毫米的内禀大小，发现了支持银河系中心存在超大质量黑洞的令人信服的证据。    2    拍摄更难    只缘身在此山中    三年前公布的人类首张黑洞照片的主角M87*距离地球约5500万光年，而人马座A*黑洞距离地球仅2.7万光年；M87星系黑洞的质量有太阳的65亿倍之多，人马座A*黑洞的质量上只相当于太阳的400万倍，换句话说，银河系中心的黑洞比M87*小了1500多倍。    为何给更近、更小的黑洞“拍照”反而用了更久的时间？    来自斯图尔德天文台、亚利桑那大学天文系和数据科学所的EHT科学家打了个比方：“有点像给一只正在追逐自己尾巴的小狗拍张清晰照片。”原来，黑洞周围的气体均以几乎接近光速绕着Sgr A*和M87*高速旋转。气体绕转M87*一周需要几天到数周时间，但对于相对小很多的Sgr A*来说，几分钟内气体即可绕转一周。这意味着就在EHT观测Sgr A*之时，该超大质量黑洞周围绕转气体的亮度和图案也在时刻快速变化着。    研究人员不得不开发新的复杂的工具来考虑围绕Sgr A*的气体运动。为M87*这种稳定和几乎所有图案都相同的目标成像相对容易，对于Sgr A*就完全不一样了。Sgr A*的黑洞照片是研究团队通过将数千张使用不同计算方法得到的图像平均起来生成的，所有这些图像都可准确拟合EHT数据。最终照片保留了在所有不同图像中更常见的特征，并抑制了不常见的特征——这也是为什么照片上显示了三个光斑的原因。    此外，M87*黑洞的转动轴只有17度，换句话说，沿着它的转轴方向看去，几乎没什么遮挡；而人类处于银河系内部，拍摄银心可以用一句古诗概括：不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。    3    充分验证    天下黑洞“一般黑”    毫无疑问，人马座A*黑洞照片的问世是一项突破性的天文观测成果。在中科院上海天文台研究员沈志强看来，这次成像结果为银河系中心超大质量黑洞的存在提供了直接证据，而与超大质量黑洞M87*的“照片”比较，表明了广义相对论的预言在跨越三个质量量级系统中的一致性，充分证明了天下黑洞“一般黑”。    “我们惊叹于环的大小与爱因斯坦广义相对论预测结果出奇一致！”来自天文与天体物理研究所的EHT项目科学家杰弗里·鲍尔也表达了相同的观点，“这些前所未有的观测极大地提升了我们对银河系中心所发生一切的认识，并为了解超大质量黑洞如何与周围环境相互作用提供了全新视角。”    在外行人看来，这两张黑洞照片都酷似甜甜圈。“它们来自两种不同类型的星系，且具有极不相同的黑洞质量，但当我们聚焦在这些黑洞的边缘时，它们看起来竟神奇地相似。”来自阿姆斯特丹大学的理论天体物理学家、EHT科学委员会联合主席塞拉·马尔科夫教授说，“这告诉我们靠近黑洞的物体完全受广义相对论支配，我们在远处所看到的不同表象是由黑洞周围物质的差异造成的”。    显然，科学家对最终获得两个不同大小黑洞的照片尤其兴奋，这为他们的对照研究提供了条件——天文学家已经开始用这些新的数据来检验超大质量黑洞周围气体行为的相关理论和模型。目前这个过程尚不完全清楚，但被认为对星系的形成和演化起了关键作用。    “后续的工作将通过偏振观测数据来研究该黑洞周围的磁场，并近一步研究与观测到的X-射线耀斑活动有关的结构变化。”沈志强介绍。    4    六地八镜    观测合作我也在    银河系中心黑洞距离地球有2.7万光年之遥，所以它的大小看上去与从地球上看38万千米远月亮上的甜甜圈大小差不多。为了给它拍这张照片，研究团队创建了观测利器：由分布在全球六地的八个射电望远镜组成的一个犹如地球那么大的虚拟望远镜。EHT对Sgr A*开展了多个晚上的观测，每次连续采集了好几个小时的数据，就如同相机的长时间曝光。    记者了解到，EHT合作组中，270名成员参与了该成果的发表，分别来自120个研究机构，包括17位中国大陆学者，分别来自中科院上海天文台、李政道研究所等单位。在此次EHT合作中，我国科学家积极参与早期EHT国际合作的共同推动、EHT望远镜观测时间的共同申请、夏威夷JCMT望远镜的观测运行、后期数据处理分析和结果分析等。    来自上海天文台的EHT合作成员路如森说：“确实，对银河系中心黑洞首次成像观测的数据分析耗费了EHT合作团队的巨大心血。”另一位来自上海天文台的EHT合作成员江悟补充说，研究团队遍历了极大的成像参数空间，才得以确定这张黑洞照片。    此外，在EHT全球联合多波段观测的2017年3至5月间，上海65米天马望远镜作为东亚VLBI网的主力测站参加了17次对M87和Sgr A*的协同观测，显著提高了东亚VLBI网的观测灵敏度，在微弱信号探测方面发挥作用。    而EHT理论和模拟工作组组长、上海交通大学李政道研究所的副教授水野陽介说：“在成像过程中，我们使用了超级计算机进行了非常大规模的计算，如上海交通大学的思源一号，数值模拟生成了超过20万张图像，我们需要分析每张图像以选择出那些可以再现黑洞附近结构的图像。”    5    下代追求    拍一部黑洞“电影”    EHT并未停止观测研究的脚步：就在今年3月份刚完成了有更多望远镜参与的联合观测。EHT的持续扩展和技术革新将使得科学家可以分享更引人注目的照片，包括在不久的将来的黑洞“电影”。    事实上，EHT在M87黑洞首次成像后，就提出了下一代EHT计划（ngEHT），希望在地球上布设更多的亚毫米波望远镜，增加观测灵敏度及频率覆盖等，来提升黑洞成像的质量与速度，以拍摄更清晰的“甜甜圈”和第一部黑洞视频。    “每一帧画面都有很大的变化，我们希望能够将它连续地拍摄下来，以得到完整的、清晰的物理过程。”沈志强也是EHT合作国内协调人，“拍摄这样一部银河系中心黑洞的‘电影’，是下一代EHT的追求。”    据介绍，中国科学家正在规划建设中国的亚毫米波VLBI望远镜，以期参与到对Sgr A*的24小时不间断的接力观测中。上海天文台副研究员江悟表示，我国西部地区具备优良的观测条件，台内同事已经前往相关区域展开选址工作，如果未来能够布设亚毫米波望远镜，或为观测提供独特的基线覆盖。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/6.htm,5/13/22,第6版:综合新闻,,False
,在春天里寻找“春天”,,    读史老张    一个多月来，因为宅在家，足不出户，内心稍有不安。窗外，小鸟叽叽喳喳，樱花已谢，映山红开得正艳……心里嘀咕，这个春天，怕是要与我擦肩而过了吧？那天，我在书架上的藏书中仔细寻找，《一百零九个春天》的书名，吸引了我，哦哦，我的“春天”，在这儿呢！    《一百零九个春天》一书，是严幼韵女士的自传，前几年在上海书展上购得，随手翻过几页，并未细读。这一次宅家，正好有时间，可以精读。严幼韵是一位传奇女性，她的故事，既励志又好玩。例如，她是复旦大学的老校友。1927年，复旦开放女禁、实行男女同校，严幼韵正是那年从沪江大学转学入校，成为复旦的第一届女生。因为出生在富商家庭，严幼韵家境富裕。她的家住在静安寺，每天到复旦上课，都要乘坐私家车。她的车牌号为84号，英文是eighty   four，上海话又念“爱的花”，所以，她的绰号就叫“爱的花”——事实上，她正是当年的复旦“校花”。那时的上海滩，拥有私家车的人极少，严幼韵一到校，就会引起学生的好奇和围观，由此，还传出过不少风流韵事。    有意思的是，严幼韵是与复旦同年同月诞生的。她生于1905年9月（复旦于1905年9月创办），2017年去世，活了112岁，耳闻目睹了旧中国的昨天和新中国的今天，是百年中国的亲历者和见证人。她的一生，既有艰辛和苦难，也有幸福和甜蜜。她的两任丈夫，都是中国著名的外交家，第一位，是中国驻菲律宾总领事杨光泩，太平洋战争爆发后，杨光泩被驻菲律宾的日军秘密杀害。第二位，是1919年在巴黎和会上拒签协议、1945年代表中国签署《联合国宪章》，为中国外交服务了几十年的顾维钧。严幼韵家族的人物和故事，是与百年中国的历史交织在一起的。她在本书“前言”中写道，“……希望年轻人能够喜欢这本书，他们可以从中了解一百年以前的中国，还有我勇敢地适应新世纪的故事。”    《一百零九个春天》，披露了若干历史内幕和曲折，是一本可读性强、图文并茂的自传。给我印象深的，还有印在扉页上的一行字：“每天都是好日子”。这是105岁的严幼韵为本书出版英文版时在“致读者”中说的话。它的原文是：“我对自己的生活很满意，身体康健，幸福快乐，当人们问我‘今天您好吗’的时候，我总是回答‘每天都是好日子’。”“每天都是好日子”这句话，我非常欣赏。我想，这大概也是严幼韵长寿的原因之一。如今，新冠疫情肆虐，封闭在家，我们难免会有无奈和怨怼，但是，只要认真读书，我们就能拥有像严幼韵那样的心态，让春天的花儿开在心中——书中有“春天”，心中就会有“春天”。    愿《一百零九个春天》，带给每一位读者一个与众不同的春天。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/7.htm,5/13/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,清如水的白描,,    李大伟    疫情期间，关在家里，两个月了，固步自封，慢慢地慢下来、静下来。无聊时刻，最好的消遣：读书。读了一叠书，器小易盈，忍不住想喷。    先说胡适《四十自述》。    四十年前泛读，一段段读，满足好奇，只获得骨骼般的印象。    四十年后精读，一字字读，窥视到细胞文字。文字是砖，一块块砌成墙，文字的精彩，决定文章成色，尤其散文。第一次发现：胡适笔下的白话文那么纯粹，如姑娘的一头乌发，不带一丝古文的白发。    这本书很薄，如果欣赏文字，最好看的是第一章，最动人的部分是年轻守寡的母亲。    胡适的母亲比胡适的父亲小三十三岁，比胡适的大姐小七岁，比大哥小两岁，双胞胎的二哥三哥仅小她四岁，这样一个家庭里忽然来了一个17岁的后妈，她的地位十分尴尬。    婚后六年，丈夫死了，留给她的遗嘱：糜（胡适的小名）儿天资颇聪明，应该令他读书。那时母亲只有二十三岁。    这一段铺垫，结构简单，交待清晰。    下面是胡适的原文：“我十一岁的时候，二哥三哥都在家，有一天母亲对他们说道：“糜今年十一岁了，你老子叫他念书，你们看看他念书念得出吗？”    “三哥冷笑道：‘哼，读书。’二哥始终没有说什么。我母亲忍了一会，回到了屋里才敢掉眼泪。她不敢得罪他们，因为一家的财政全在二哥手里，我若出门求学是要靠他供给学费的。所以她只能掉眼泪，终不敢哭。”    “你老子”：一个你，凸显出他们之间的距离，因为他们不是她生的，却是她丈夫的儿子。    “我母亲”：一个我，说明他与哥哥们的距离，同父异母，情不自禁地称“我母亲”。    “不敢哭”：皖南一带徽派建筑都是木板墙，隔音差，所以不敢哭。我住过徽派老房子，读到此三字，体会尤深，刺痛刺痛。    胡适的白描，只有叙述，不动声色、不下判断、不做解释，态度全出来了，阴暗心理也跳出来了，在场人物的嘴脸历历在目，让读者身临其境。白描中水印出胡适的白话文功力，没有半点私塾旧书的梅干菜陈腐味，不带一丝旧文化的皱纹。但文字的洗练、段落的紧凑，隐约古文荫下的遗骸。    文学评论家夏志清如此夸奖：“清如水的纯白话。”    胡适最大的贡献，首倡“白话文”的新文化运动，自己的笔墨就是式范。    胡适还有一本回忆录，胡适英文口述，唐德刚英文记录，书名《胡适口述自传》，那是应哥伦比亚大学“中国口述历史学部”之约，面向英语读者，那时唐德刚正在哥大读历史学博士。二十年后又由唐德刚照着英文翻译回来，想起一个顺口溜：“天上下雪不下雨，雪到地上变成雨，变成雨来多麻烦，不如当初就下雨”，出口转内销，圈子兜得蛮大的，不过这本中文回忆录，就文字而言，脱胎于英语，等于二手货，显不出胡氏特色。    小说靠情节引人入胜，所以译文不影响阅读体验。凭借文字趣味砌墙的散文随笔，译文是嚼过的馍，原味没了。    不过唐德刚是文章大家，他对这本书的注释，比这本二手货的中文本子好看多了，显示出唐氏风格：白话文里时不时夹杂着一两句古文笔调，比如写胡适1917年在哥伦比亚大学参加博士面试，题目是中国哲学，围着考他的六位洋教授，只有一位懂中文，但不能读古典原著，唐德刚忍不住调侃：“考他的那六位虬髯客”，形象直白，别有风味。唐德刚涉猎广，又能扯，海阔天空，满肚子的学问憋不住，一个小问题的注释，就是一篇文章，给《胡适口述自传》写个序，结果成了一本书：《胡  适  杂忆》，比原著还厚，再请人给这个序写序，好一个“呱呱叫”的唐老鸭！（呱呱叫：沪语里顶级的意思。在沪苏北人对白：“拉一勾？吾妈妈。身体好？呱呱叫！）。一个注释，引经据典、掌故民谣、捎带开涮，杂乱纷呈，虽洋洋洒洒，却天高云淡，唠叨而不讨厌，就像山东快书的开场白：“火车站里有火车，火车里面有旅客，旅客提着旅行包，不是上车就下车”。听山东快书，首先是开场白，啰嗦得噱！一炮打响，才算本事！读大嘴巴唐氏文章，一地碎花瓷，琐碎而不厌。    胡适的文章是清蒸宽带鱼，唐德刚则是红烧头尾，时不时淋上几滴古文勾芡，如李锦记老抽清浇上色，文白叠加，就成了复合调味料，唐氏臭鳜鱼，真入味！读《胡适口述自传》，一定要看唐的注释，伴娘比新娘子好看！    要欣赏胡适的白话文的直视无碍溪下石的清爽相，只有看他自己亲手脍炙的《四十自序》。再看看当下文字：傻白而罗嗦，因无古文的熏陶，骨架都散了。    现在的上乘散文隐约间有两溪流派：    一文白，新中国成立前夕出版的梁实秋《雅室小品》，上世纪八十年代的如张中行老先生《负暄琐话》三集；    一纯白，除了胡适，难觅那么纯粹的。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-13/8.htm,5/13/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

6000亩练塘茭白采摘，政府部门全力“吆喝”,每天500吨茭白  大家一起帮忙吃,,    眼下，又到了一年一度练塘露天茭白上市的季节。初夏的青浦区练塘镇，田间地头满眼葱绿。这几天，练塘茭农正忙着采收今年第一茬露天茭白，抓紧将这一时令美味送到市民手中。受疫情影响，外地的客户几乎“全军覆没”，政府部门正在帮茭农千方百计想办法，也希望市民、企业、单位、电商平台一起来帮忙，让清香鲜嫩的上海名产多多走上市民餐桌。    外地客户今年一个也进不来    昨天在练塘镇金前村，练绿蔬果专业合作社理事长徐惠均指着周围一大片绿油油的茭白地说，这一片差不有400亩。天下着绵绵细雨，地里几位农妇戴着斗笠、穿着胶鞋正在田里采茭白。高耸茂密的茭白叶几乎把她们全部遮住。刚摘下的茭白连叶带果有一米多高，每十支左右扎成一捆放在田梗上。    徐惠均说，他自己有80亩茭白田，其中30亩大棚茭白已经卖得差不多了。今天第一天开始采摘露天茭白，预计可以采摘5000斤。以后每天要10000斤左右，销售压力很大。徐惠均说，以前都是田头交易，本市、外地的客户都会来。今年一个也进不来，只能靠镇里帮着推销。    地产名品“美人腿”即将大量上市    练塘茭白是上海首个获得国家地理标志产品保护的蔬菜品种，有“水中人参”的美誉。鲜嫩可口，营养丰富的练塘茭白嫩茎肥大、白净整洁、多肉柔嫩，还带有几丝微甜，故又被称作“美人腿”。    种植大户谢秋华最近早出晚归泡在茭白田里，他是土生土长的练塘镇泖甸村人，从事茭白种植销售快要30年了。谢秋华告诉记者，今年露天茭白长势喜人，亩产约为4000斤。前段时间，通过团购的方式，大棚茭白销售也不错。现在，随着气温升高，露天茭白也陆陆续续开始采收了，农户一般清晨5时左右就要下田采摘了。    徐惠均说，镇里有总容量达万吨级的冷库，为合作社和其他种植户存储茭白。但他还是希望能尽快把采收上来的新鲜茭白马上销售掉。一方面冷库保存的时间毕竟有限，新鲜的茭白口感更好，另一方面，对茭农来说，早点出货心里会更踏实些。    镇干部打地铺全力帮茭农“吆喝”    4月20日以来，练塘1521亩大棚茭白陆续上市，截至5月12日，总上市量1640吨，主要运往多家销售平台与社区直供，深受广大市民欢迎。5月中旬至6月中旬，露天茭白将迎来采摘高峰，预计上市6166亩，日均产量达500吨左右，涉及合作社38家、散户39家，到6月中旬预计上市总产量约为15400吨。    原来，曾经销往北京、河南、广东等多个省市的练塘茭白受疫情影响中断了全国渠道，而本市因为农贸市场停摆，导致出货量严重萎缩。为了帮茭农解决销路问题，从市农业农村委、市商务委，到青浦区农业农村委、练塘镇农业农村服务中心都操碎了心。除了主动对接保供单位，相关部门通过大量工作联系了很多大型超市和电商平台，竭尽全力解决练塘茭白产销问题。    练塘镇农业农村服务中心主任陆剑岗说，他和20名同事已经在办公室睡了好多天了，每天都在联系解决产品销路和采收工短缺问题。    虽然很多部门都在努力，但高峰时每天多达500吨的产量，一时半会儿很难消化。陆剑岗呼吁社会各方关注练塘茭白产销问题，期待政府、电商平台、社区“团长”、广大市民齐心携力，一起把眼下的困难扛过去。    爱心采购请联系    汤老师：13916079339            021-59253718    石老师：18502192949    夏老师：18501607776    沈老师：15021262935    本报记者  沈月明  杨欢    通讯员  李艳丽,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-14/3.htm,5/14/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,小区群开“人才团”  成了6单,,    “大家都接龙购买生活物资，我也‘推销’一波自己的学生，我们有生物医学工程、食品和制药工程专业的学生。邻居们的公司如果正好招人，岗位合适，欢迎向我‘砸来’（用人需求）。看到邻居们这么热心有爱，我也发来试试，万一有机会呢！”不久前，上海理工大学健康科学与工程学院的辅导员朱旭在自家小区群里忐忑发出了这样一条消息，没想到成功为多名毕业生就业牵线搭桥，申城封控的这一个多月，已有6名学生顺利拿到录用通知。    这场堪称神奇的“就业开团”，源于朱旭的热心。她住在张江，小区周围有不少生物医药企业，在参与社区志愿服务的时候认识的许多邻居，就职于这些公司，于是一个念头在她心里萌生了——“我们的学生专业对口，受疫情影响，企业走不进学校，学生也无法外出实习、应聘，能否请邻居们牵线为学生们创造就业机会呢？”    信息刚刚发布，朱旭的手机就接连闪现了14条好友申请。“我是做生物制药的，我们公司一直在招相关专业的人才。”“可以给我发一些生物制药相关专业的学生简历，我们有相当多的岗位。”“有本科生推荐吗？我们部门就在招人。”“我在临港实验室，我们课题组在招人，本科生硕士生都可以投简历。”热心的邻居们一下子“涌来”，令朱旭心头大喜，许多邻居所在的公司都有招聘需求，其中一位还邀请她加入了“生命科研招聘求职人才库”。    朱旭立刻忙碌起来，她与邻居们一一沟通，了解岗位详情，再向所有求职学生公布信息。此外，她还细致地根据岗位具体要求，推荐了专业、能力高度适配的40余名学生，喜滋滋地把简历打包发给相关企业负责人。    “您好，我这里是上海临港实验室……”几天后，制药工程专业的学生付子让接到了面试邀请电话。今年考研失利的她正在纠结是否“二战”，看到朱旭老师发来的招聘简章决定试试，没想到最终抓住了这个难能可贵的机遇，顺利通过面试。“疫情之下，能用这样特别的方式找到工作，让我觉得既幸运又暖心，我会怀揣赤诚，把这份来自社会的关怀与帮助融入之后的工作”，付子让感慨地说。    抛出“橄榄枝”的邻居徐白，平时与朱旭只是“点头之交”。看到群内的消息，就职于中科院上海药物所药物安全评价研究中心的她，立即加了朱旭的微信。徐白的部门正有用人需求，她一边确认上理工毕业生的教育背景等基本情况，一边与中心人力资源部门同事对接，几天时间就促成了后续线上面试等招聘流程。“这届毕业生太不容易了，看到同学们拿到录用通知我很开心。而且有位学生刚好进入我所在的部门，我也机缘巧合成为受益人，希望她能在这里成就更好的自己。”    最终，经过这次“人才社区团”，6名上理工毕业生和企业迅速实现“双向奔赴”，顺利拿到录用通知。其实，这样灵活推进就业的方式在上理工并非毕业季的临时“抱佛脚”，每年学校都会针对就业数据进行分析，以学生需求作为出发点，将利于学生的个人发展作为根本遵循，多渠道、多途径、多切口为毕业生提供不断线的就业服务。    本报记者  易蓉  特约通讯员  董真,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-14/4.htm,5/14/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,我只能再活几个月  想回家陪儿子中考,广西癌症爸爸暂时走不了，但各方救助还在进行,    求助    今年3月初，我陪着患晚期胰腺癌的丈夫来上海求医，住在徐汇区宛平南路200号的汉庭酒店。跑了多家医院后，医生们给出几乎相同的结论：已无法手术治疗，病人可能只有最后几个月的生命。目前，丈夫只能靠服用化疗药和止疼片控制病情。他最后的心愿，就是想回家陪着儿子考完中考。可现在疫情封控，我们一直抢不到高铁票，真不知道该怎么回家啊！    广西柳州  杨女士    帮忙>>>    重病父亲思儿心切    在昨天的新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，记者拨通电话后，传来的是杨女士一阵阵伤心哭泣。她告诉记者，因为病痛缠身和对儿子的日夜思念，丈夫吃不下、睡不着，常常在唉声叹气中泪如雨下，“我知道自己时日不多了，我和孩子说过要陪着他一起中考，真想回家啊……”    为满足丈夫在生命最后时刻的愿望，杨女士没日没夜地刷手机，但始终抢不到能离开上海的高铁票。“我们只想要两张去南京的车票，再闭环转车回到柳州，按规定隔离后，父子俩就能见面了。求求你们帮帮孩子的爸爸吧，他真的不知道还能撑到哪一天……”    急送“口粮”中医问诊    “能帮我们一定会尽力帮的！”记者立刻通过相关渠道与上海铁路方面取得联系，对方传来的回复是：按照最新调整的疫情防控要求，乘客从上海抵达南京南站后，将就地隔离14天才能转车。记者再与机场方面取得联系，经查询，没有任何航班飞往广西柳州。    “既然暂时回不去，我们先想办法把你丈夫的身体养养好。”在记者耐心宽慰后，杨女士终于平复了心绪。“他现在只能吃半流质（食品），可不可以有点酸奶和水果啊？”杨女士提出新的求助。在详细记录下这份“保命菜单”后，记者迅速发给“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟。“这些都让我们来！”公益企业百联集团旗下联华超市迅速调配物资，筹集了低糖原味酸奶、火龙果、苹果、黄瓜、番茄、八宝粥等“特需品”；公益企业百联集团旗下上海第一医药立刻翻查库存、紧急调集两大罐黄先生急需的“雅培安素”蛋白粉。而公益机构上海泰坤堂中医医院在听到广西爸爸的遭遇后，迅速召集名医，为黄先生电话问诊、把脉开方。    与此同时，上海铁路方面和东方航空公司也传来消息：如有车次或航班开启，将最优先保障爸爸回家看看儿子。    感激众人鼎力救助    面对“全城救助”，在又一次给记者打来电话时，杨女士喜极而泣，“我们心里真的是特别感激，有了你们的支持，孩子的爸爸说，自己一定能够挺住，一定能见到儿子的！”  本报记者  徐驰  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月13日11时至5月14日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求255件，其中紧急类诉求123件，已推动解决107件（含“公益联盟”18件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-14/5.htm,5/14/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False

,咖啡到了,,    杨晓晖    等到连咖啡也经由团购团到之时，差不多是喜出望外，欣喜若狂了。日子渐渐恢复了生机，除了主要的生活物资，原来人们不好意思、属于非必需品、给志愿者增加负担的蛋糕、可乐、炸鸡、自制面包的面粉黄油等等，陆陆续续开团成功。一波波非必需品被送到一波波买家之时，手机上欢腾的气息完全是虚拟的派对规模了。困境之中，一点点好形势的变化，刺激人们的幽默感与幸福度。各种各样的小爱好竟然被尊重起来，被评价被赞赏。“彼之砒霜，吾之玫瑰。”差别化在基本需求实现后，也开出了玫瑰花。    52包品牌甚佳的挂耳式咖啡像一排漂亮的子弹在客厅排开。楼群里晒出的用餐照片，随着团购的日渐丰盛，桌上有荤有素有汤，一顿五六个菜式，都有过年气氛了。五六个团购群连续发出的信息，一天的时间也很好打发。争吵的，和好的，诉苦的，感恩的，随便一屏，都是勃勃生机。    有人对群主说要吃毛豆，有人告诉他图片上是蚕豆。    “谁家买了蚕豆呀？好想吃。”“阿姨，你要吗？我不吃豆子，团购的放在冰箱里两天了，我送你，不要钱，拿去吃吧。别纠结。我放在门口噢！”    “挡不住的诱惑。爱你。门口有样小东西拿一下噢！谢谢你解了我们夫妻的思豆之情。”“客气了，阿姨。”    “用菜刀砍肉，刀不行了，谁有磨刀石呀？”“我有，马上放到你家门口。”    “团购搭配的粉皮怎么办呀？没有咸菜呀！”“你试试黄瓜丝胡萝卜丝拌。”    “有两大袋米放在一楼，是居委发的，需要的，自己拿东西去装。”“这样不卫生，我下来拿小袋子一个个分装好，有需要的自己去取。我自己不要，给三楼的老人家。”“我也不要。”    楼组长老太太，在群里说，自己有基础病，干得有点累了，希望有人自荐继续她的工作。也许老太太知道我已经退休，她私信要我自荐做楼组长，只能惭愧回她：因为没有打过疫苗针，连志愿者也当不了呀！老太太继续她辛苦的工作。而“我能够做什么？”当然困扰我。“米，我也不要。”这么说的时候觉得也很矫情。    有时候不发声比发声好。有人在一个优质团购群里推销自己的东西，并且被证明货次价高。建议他珍惜资源，别蹭，另组。应该发声的时候就要发声。    某日，女儿盛装打扮，说在家也要搞得漂亮。我马上也往脸上涂上粉底霜。以前习惯上班或者外出，才涂粉底。“要见人了嘛！”那么以后，难道可以天天是“黄脸婆”？——化妆觉悟就产生于被封时刻。从此头面，天天是外出家蹲一样妆。——人，难道首先不是给自己看的？如果那张脸连自己也不要看，你难道希望还有人要看？    三月底的时候，老家的好朋友开着车来送菜。也没有进屋来，两人在小区门口聊了一会儿。那时候还没有产生化妆觉悟，素面朝天。过后想想，还好，脸上一个大口罩。以后，就是老友想看朝天的素面还看不着了。物以稀为贵。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-14/7.htm,5/14/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,给上海小朋友回封信,,    林紫    前不久，我的朋友高浩容博士在新华路遇见了一只纸飞机，飞机上写着：“给奥密克戎：你好，我是一位女孩，我想说我们不讨厌你，但是想战胜你。你知道你给我们带来多大的麻烦？如果你觉得我讲得很有道理，请你给我回信。谢谢。”落款处没有姓名，只画了一个小女孩的模样。    看到这封信的时候，我的心都化了，想象着孩子站在窗前、面朝天空“寄信”的样子，想象着她的身后或许正站着一位爱她、懂她、陪伴她的长辈，不急不躁、不愠不恼，不比孩子快一步，也不比孩子慢一步地，与孩子一同望向窗外，看纸飞机缓缓划过天空、轻轻柔柔地飘落在街道的某个角落。    对小女孩来说，“奥密克戎”回不回信已不再重要，因为无论它带来了多大的麻烦，最终也只是长长一生中的苍狗浮云；而那位愿意陪伴她写信和寄信的长辈，才是她生命里的“日月光华、旦复旦兮”——可以给她超越生命长度的温暖和指引。    不是每一位长辈都可以如此淡定。居家的日子里，大人有大人的压力。压力之下，每个人都可能有应激反应，比如易怒、比如冷漠、比如对孩子完全失去耐心——尤其当家里不止一个孩子、再大的房间也盛不下他们旺盛的精力和无穷的吵闹时。    可是很多的长辈又希望自己能够淡定。常有家长在林紫公益心理陪“沪”热线里说：“每次发完火都会后悔，其实当时蛮好多一点耐心的……”或者是：“我也知道小人需要陪伴，但大人有那么多事要忙，烦也烦死了，哪里有闲工夫？”    其实，无论有没有奥密克戎，“耐心与闲工夫”都是这个时代的奢侈之物，因为成人世界的价值已经交由“有用”和“忙碌”来定义了，人们忙着研究空间、时间和精力的最大化利用、忙着担忧未来，哪里还有多余的心脑内存给到“在纸飞机上写一封永远不会有回复的信”这种没用的事情呢？    于是，孩子们的世界也开始被各种有用和忙碌占满，他们被期待要尽快跟上大人的步伐，不要“添乱”——虽然居家的日子里他们一样承受着生活节奏变化而带来的压力。然而，对年幼的孩子来说，即使他们无法用语言讲清楚正在发生的事情，但他们的情绪体验却一样真实而深刻。而这样的体验所形成的情绪性记忆，才是决定孩子一生幸福与否的关键。    当长辈们意识到这一点，会发现：原来耐心和闲工夫是越用越有的宝物——越是愿意陪伴孩子、越是能从孩子身上获得最本真的力量；越有力量，就越有耐心在亲子关系上，因为不再需要从不断的忙碌中找寻自我价值；越有耐心，就越有“闲工夫”来发挥最大的想象力。而想象力，不仅不受居家与否的限制、还可以将亲子关系从方寸之地延伸到月亮那里……    幸运的是，“月亮”那里，一直住着一些有爱有耐心的大人小人——当我邀请他们给上海小朋友回封信，他们纷纷响应、还发来了各自的视频。    现在，我也想邀请大家：张开想象的翅膀，给上海小朋友们回封信吧——    信的内容不重要，重要的是：通过回信，我们与孩子们在一起。    至于奥密克戎回不回信，随他去。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-14/8.htm,5/14/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,凌晨，石库门前的守夜人,,    午夜的延安中路路灯依然亮着，映照着夜的空旷和宁静。路边搭起的一个简易亭子引人注目。亭子的防水布沿上贴着一排用A4纸打印的字——凯南临时警务站，在风雨的侵蚀下显得有点凌乱。一辆警用摩托车，四个“大白”在一排暗沉沉的石门库门前显得格外醒目。直接的联想是，他们在守护石库门里的梦中人。此时已是15日的0时。    临危受命    查验完身份，两位民警接受了采访。冯炬伟、杨晶程，这对民警“师徒”已经在这一个片区值守了28天。石门一路以西的升平居民区、以东的中凯居民区，还有茂名北路两侧，是他们的阵地。这一块区域，4月中旬时疫情暴发迅猛，陆续检测出的阳性病例数以百计。与此同时，负责这一片区的两个居委会，一个只有一人幸免，一个“阳”了一半。师徒二人被“空投”到这里，接力“扑火”。    冯炬伟介绍，这里一度疫情严重，和石库门里的居民生活环境密切相关。这些老房子的住户大部分仍然煤卫合用，升平居民区一些人家甚至还在用马桶，导致病毒迅速传播。    转运、消杀，核酸、抗原检测，物资保供、看病配药……冯炬伟、杨晶程，“领导”着利彩云、张丽茜两名年轻志愿者，配合居委会的剩余人员，竭尽全力扑灭疫情，守护在病毒面前特别脆弱的人们。    28天，师徒二人吃住在升平石库门里的一间办公室。睡地板，吃盒饭，热水器坏了，只能洗冷水澡。有一天开线上会议，冯炬伟一直在咳嗽。领导担心地问：“你是不是中招了？”实际上是他一天没喝水了。    无论下半夜的转运，还是大清早的核酸检测，都能看到冯炬伟和杨晶程的身影。中凯南社区里有一个曾经拒做核酸检测的女子，只有杨晶程打电话“请”她，并站在现场“督导”，她才肯下来。杨晶程说，只要她肯做核酸检测，这实在是小事。    看着天亮    栏杆里面站着两名女子，虽然穿着防护服，戴着口罩、面罩，但你仍然能感受到青春气息。利彩云、张丽茜这两名志愿者，是中凯南这一片老房子的守夜人。过了0时，她们中的一个可以稍微睡两三个小时。清晨6时30分，她们就要双双出现在岗位上。    利彩云1994年生，疫情前是一名七浦路批发市场的销售员，老家安徽芜湖。张丽茜，1998年生，老家江西南昌，以前的工作是一名天猫的商家客服。公司暂停营业后，她们都选择了做志愿者。“闲着也是闲着，想做一点有意义的事。”利彩云和张丽茜分别于3月30日和4月10日被派驻到这里，而这也可能是她们至今最辛苦的人生经历。每天加上中午打瞌睡，她们一天只睡3-5个小时。“卧室”是路边一个废弃的核酸检测帐篷，“席梦思”是捡来的几块纸板。她们每天穿着防护服睡，只摘掉面罩。尽管如此，早上醒来额头、眼皮上全是蚊子包。最“悲剧”的是，4月23日晚下大雨，张丽茜醒来发现睡在了“水里”，衣服、被子、纸板全湿了。那一晚，两个人一夜没睡，看着天慢慢亮起来。    我爱上海    检查“骑手”电子通行证，安排外来物品消杀、静置，组织保供物资运送，转运、核酸检测……每天冯炬伟和杨晶程有做不完的事。由于临街老小区的特殊情况，常有居民出门“溜达”，甚至遛狗，规劝是他们天天要做的事。利彩虹和张丽茜，运送快递，每次核酸、抗原检测做辅助工作，劝导居民，检查进出人员……每天也是不得闲。张丽茜利用做客服的优势，耐心说服这里的老人注意防护细节，效果很明显。不管多辛苦，只要听到居民说一声“大白，谢谢你”，她们就觉得心里暖暖的，一切都值了。    两个女生说，她们来做志愿者，都是“先斩后奏”，父母知道后虽然担心，但还是很支持，最多的话就是希望她们注意安全。两人都说，来做志愿者，没想过有没有报酬，只是觉得这个时候要有人站出来，为这个城市做点事。利彩云说她喜欢上海的“激情”，张丽茜说她喜欢上海的“快节奏”。    冯炬伟说，从5月12日至今，这一片区已经三天没有“阳”了。这两天没有转运任务，核酸检测频次也减少了，工作似乎“闲”了一点。他为此感到高兴，不是因为工作相对轻松了，而是这一片老小区终于在经历暴风雨后，重归平静与安宁。本报记者  沈月明,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-15/4.htm,5/15/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,“小电驴”宅基埭头巡村忙　众租户生活物资有着落,,    打开一张情况统计汇总表，门牌号、姓名、困难类型、具体情况、解决办法等信息一目了然，上面记录着封控期间村民的生活物资需求以及协调解决办法。    表格的设计者是金山区金山卫镇塔港村村民王丹平，她是长宁区一所职校的教师，也是一名中共党员。学校因疫情停课后，王丹平主动到村里报到，骑着一辆电瓶车投身到人员排摸、核酸检测、巡逻值守等各项志愿活动中。    据了解，位于金山卫镇西北部的塔港村，与浙江嘉兴平湖市新仓镇相邻，所辖的1组和20组因靠近老钱圩镇集市，是租户最集中的地方，总人数有170人左右。平日里，租户们习惯在附近的集市采购物资，但封控以来，购买渠道被迫“中断”，再加上塔港村远离镇区，物资配送难度更大。    为了保障租户的生活需求，王丹平充分发挥其情况明、人头熟的优势，帮助他们解决物资紧缺难题。“本地村民有自留地，平时会养一些鸡鸭，生活物资相对充足。”据王丹平介绍，她每天骑着“小电驴”穿梭在宅基埭头，上门询问并记录租户的生活需求后，再到本地村民家中询问物资存量情况，最后把协调到的物资按需分给租户。    “我从小就生活在这里，周围的邻居都很熟悉，大家也都愿意把家里多余的蔬菜物资无偿拿出来。”王丹平说，“我还教他们使用手机通过橙团、美团、京东等线上平台采购，现在大家都学会了，基本不会有缺物资的困扰。”    值得一提的是，在王丹平的感染下，其他村民也主动加入这项志愿者活动，“目前，外来人员集中的小组都有一名联络人，负责与租户沟通，最后汇总诉求再向我反映，提高了工作效率和帮扶精准度。”王丹平说。    “以前村里经常会接到租户打来的电话，缺菜的、没米的……各种诉求都有，有些人情绪还比较激动。得益于这种邻里互助的形式，最近一段时间，这种现象基本没有了。”塔港村党总支书记朱姝说。  本报记者  屠瑜  通讯员  周倩,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-15/5.htm,5/15/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
,1700公里风雨兼程  广西爸爸昨出发回家,“护送二人组”轮流开车  预计下午抵达柳州 ,    本报记者  徐驰  钱俊毅  季晟祯    在前日中午新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”紧急热线求助直播连线中，来自广西柳州杨女士的声声泣诉，一次次揪痛着记者的心，“孩子的爸爸患晚期胰腺癌，他的生命可能只有几个月了。孩子的爸爸只想早点回家，兑现自己的承诺：陪着儿子中考……”（详见昨天5版）    昨天19时25分，在记者多方联络下，上海裕皖实业发展有限公司派出别克商务车，郑洲、汪纯组成“护送二人组”，连夜载着广西爸妈，风雨兼程向着1700多公里外的柳州出发了。预计今天15时40分，他们就能回到家乡。    从昨晚出发起，新民晚报、“新民帮侬忙”随即在今日头条、抖音开启“在沪病危爸爸想陪儿子中考，上海到柳州1700公里转运”慢直播，这一夜全网观看总数破100万，“一路平安”“祝达成心愿”“辛苦了”“顺顺利利回家”，所有人都在真心祝福，所有人都在一起加油。    5月14日19时25分    上海宛平南路汉庭酒店    广西爸爸出发回家    前天，在接到杨女士求助后，记者虽经努力，但由于种种原因，通过高铁和航班都无法离沪。“先让爸爸养好身体吧。”“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟迅速行动：百联集团旗下的联华超市和上海第一医药分别送来酸奶等专属礼包和蛋白粉；上海泰坤堂中医医院线上问诊，开方抓药。    昨天13时46分，上海裕皖实业发展有限公司董事长余承涛和公司总经理徐士超商议后，给记者打来电话：“如果广西爸爸身体允许，我们派车和司机，将他送回家。1700多公里路，如果一切顺利，17个小时就能到家！”    记者迅速多方联络，在得到黄先生同意后，立即向广西柳州《南国今报》发信息，很快拿到当地开出的接收证明。同时，黄先生夫妇连忙赶往医院做了核酸检测，上海第一医药又送来8套防护服、20个口罩和一大盒抗原试剂。19时许，“裕皖实业”的汪纯、郑洲驾驶车牌号为“沪DXZ919”的别克商务车，从浦东新区唐陆公路赶到徐汇区宛平南路200号的汉庭酒店。    19时25分，黄先生和杨女士收拾完行李，下楼坐上车子。送广西爸爸回家看儿子——1700公里转运开启了！    5月14日21时许    上海市金山区亭枫道口    自测抗原驶离上海    坐上车后，黄先生和妻子杨女士如释重负。杨女士说，当初带着丈夫来上海看病，受疫情影响，一直滞留宾馆，心里很焦虑。看到“新民帮侬忙”解决了许多求助，抱着试一试心态发来信息。“我原本想着能不能替我们抢票，真没想到，最后是派专车一路护送我们回去。”话到此处，她语音哽咽。    在车上，来自“裕皖实业”的汪纯、郑洲两位师傅时刻关心着重病缠身的广西爸爸，多次调试座椅，让他能躺下休息。郑洲坐在副驾驶，一路关心路况，他说自己和柳州有缘，哥哥曾在柳州当兵。    当车辆行至亭枫道口，准备驶上离沪高速时，安检人员示意靠边停车。在看了相关证明后，根据防疫规定，要求两位司机再做抗原自测。21时许，在确认阴性结果后，安检人员一边挥手放行，一边打气鼓励：“一路平安！”    5月14日21时30分    浙江省下沙服务区旁    爸爸疼了妈妈晕了    可能是到了每晚需要服用止疼片的时候，广西爸爸因为疼痛而低声呻吟。妻子杨女士也不太舒服，因为晕车而犯起阵阵恶心。“阿姨和叔叔都不舒服，赶快停车！”21时45分许，汪纯和郑洲把车停在了浙江省下沙服务区旁。    加油的时候，郑洲赶忙询问工作人员有没有晕车药。打听了一圈，还是“空手而归”。“没关系，静一静透透气就好。他爸爸吃完药，我就放心了。”杨女士拧开矿泉水瓶，小心翼翼地给丈夫喂下止疼片。吃过药后，稍微舒坦些的广西爸爸闭上了眼睛。    “他不喊疼了，我们快出发吧。真是给你们添麻烦了。”杨女士充满歉意。对此，汪纯和郑洲连连摇头：“没事的！您和叔叔有什么不舒服地方只管说，随时随地都可以停车。”    5月14日23时许    浙江省杭州市萧山服务区旁    吃完酸奶爸爸睡了    昨天23时许，车辆停靠在了浙江省杭州市萧山服务区旁，稍作休息。刚刚还在闭目养神的广西爸爸，用手轻轻碰了碰身边的妻子。“是不是饿了？我马上给你弄吃的。”这些年来，一直悉心照料丈夫的杨女士马上就收到了“暗号”。她从包里拿出一次性饭盒，缓缓打开，里面是为丈夫特意分装好的酸奶。“他现在只能吃半流质食物，还不能吃太多，我得把每一顿的量都给分好。”妻子边说边舀起一勺酸奶，小心翼翼举到丈夫嘴边。一勺、两勺、三勺……饭盒慢慢空了，接过汪纯和郑洲递过的餐巾纸，妻子又细心将丈夫的嘴角擦拭干净。看着眼前的这一幕，郑洲被暖到了：“阿姨，您把叔叔照顾得真好！网友都在评论区里留言：这就是相濡以沫，这就是携手相伴……”“如果可以，我真希望和他就这么一直好好过下去。”妻子的话音又有些哽咽，“你们累了就要休息，饿了就要吃东西，要把自己的身体照顾好啊。”    车子再次启动，郑洲和汪纯习惯性喊了声：“阿姨叔叔，有需要你们就说。”杨女士立刻拍了拍他们的肩膀，附耳轻语：“他累了，睡着了，让他睡会吧。”郑洲和汪纯立刻压低声音：“让叔叔好好睡吧，明天就能到家了！”    5月15日1时50分许    沪昆高速江西上饶段    遭遇拥堵交警给力    今天凌晨1时50分许，在沪昆高速距离江西省上饶服务区38.4公里处，护送车遭遇拥堵。导航软件显示，8.3公里的拥堵路段要行驶近4小时。“叔叔阿姨，等不起啊！”郑洲和汪纯心急如焚。    “联系交警，走紧急车道！”评论区网友的一句话点醒汪纯，他立即拨通江西省公安厅交通管理局应急电话，“我们从上海来，车上有癌症病人，要紧急送回广西！”随后，在工作人员提示下，汪纯添加了江西高速交警直属五支队二大队的工作微信，迅速发送通行证、病历等信息。2时11分，江西交警回复：同意车辆驶入应急车道通行。2时16分，车辆刚前行5分钟，又被应急车道上一辆白色私家车挡住去路。“我车上的故障灯亮了，所以停在这等人来修。”在雨中，当汪纯和郑洲向司机说明情况后，对方二话不说清开路障，将车挪到一旁。路通了！凌晨2时31分，在经历40多分钟的“艰难曲折”后，别克商务车开出拥堵路段，驶上前往柳州的坦途。    5月15日3时20分    江西省鹰潭服务区旁    车神开启吃播模式    今天3时20分，车辆停靠鹰潭服务区旁。看到广西爸爸渐渐醒来，汪纯和郑洲开始了传说中的“报菜名”，“阿姨叔叔，饿了吧！煎饺、面条、米粉、锅贴、手抓饼……想吃啥，我们弄给你们吃。”“不用了，不用了！”广西爸爸和妻子连连摆手，“他只能吃半流质，我怕晕车，你们都饿坏了，你们吃吧。”用力半支撑起身子，广西爸爸对着车内的直播镜头，用低弱的声音讲述心里的话语，“感谢大家一路守护。我状态不好，就不多说话了，一切都在心里。”    此刻，汪纯和郑洲拿来“补给”，“阿姨，这是煎饺、手抓饼，您多少吃点，要照顾好叔叔，您得撑住！”正说着，突然间，画风一变，两位“车神”开启吃播模式，一个捧着热乎乎的榨菜肉丝面，一个咬着油滋滋的烤肠。短短10分钟后，汪纯和郑洲“吃完收工”，驾车继续出发。“不用拐去衡阳了”“从吉安那边走”“走井冈山那边进湖南，在湖南地区走一会就广西地区了”……评论区，一台台“人肉导航仪”再次上线，惟愿一路平安。    5月15日8时15分    湖南省醴陵服务区    高血压药真不能停    雨，下了一整夜，还在下。已是早晨8时15分，车辆缓缓停靠在湖南省醴陵服务区旁。趁着休息间隙，记者赶紧打电话给汪纯、郑洲：“跑了1000多公里，快到了快到了！”他们的嗓音略带沙哑，却难掩兴奋。汪纯说，雨路不好开，但他们轮流换班，一路还算顺利。“谢谢大家关心，我们一路都很平安，多亏了两位司机照顾。”看着车内的直播镜头，杨女士撑起身子，打着招呼、报着平安。而此刻，广西爸爸闭着眼睛，半靠在椅子上休憩。    这一路，她也时刻在关心网友的评论，有时还会轻声向丈夫读留言，“这个夜晚，有这么多人陪伴，我们不孤单。”    “大家放心，有什么情况，我们会克服的。”汪纯揉了揉眼睛说。一旁的郑洲拿出高血压药，一口吞下，“药真的不能停啊！”    距离柳州660公里，稍作休息，车辆再次朝着家的方向出发。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-15/6.htm,5/15/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,纸上漫游,,    戴蓉    这个春天，网购的新书都在路上，索性把书架上的旧书重新归类，按作者进行系统阅读。    舒国治的书，从来不必正襟危坐地读，随手翻开一本，看到哪里算哪里似乎与他随性的调子更相符。“理想的下午，宜于泛看泛听，浅浅而尝，漫漫而走。不断地更换场景，不断地移动……”泛泛、浅浅、漫漫这些词，以中年心境读来别有一番味道。    《门外汉的京都》开篇写的就是稍显落寞的下雨天。“雨天，属于寂人。这时候，太多景物都没有人跟你抢了。”京都的竹篱茅舍、柴扉、小桥流水，甚至稻田，在作者的眼里都是可喜的存在。这些景致对于在京都客居过一年的我，如倒流的记忆一般亲切。我在鸭川的河床上纳过凉，在桥上看过暮色和行人，也曾在电车上欣赏过人家庭前屋后清澈的水渠、花树和阳光下闪着青光的水稻田。    《流浪集》的文章也颇有会心之处。“近两年在大陆游山玩水，发现倘不催促时辰，乐意一个镇接一个镇的停停玩玩，竟可以像武侠小说中所写的潇洒自在，譬似这一日到了某镇，随见一家饭馆，便‘上得楼来，拣了一副清幽的座位，唤店小二点了酒菜，自斟自酌……’楼栏之下，一片湖光山色，如此好景，真舍不得一人独拥……”作者坐过的露天茶座，有杭州西湖、安徽采石矶的采石公园、江苏周庄张厅里的茶室，上海的复兴公园和北京中山公园的“来今雨轩”。中国人对于茶，一向有着微妙复杂的情感。客途中停下来喝杯茶，恰如生活短暂的休止符，亦是偶开天眼察看世间难得的一瞬。某年我去浙江丽水游玩，走到白银谷里，偶见一处茶座。这木结构的老房子原是私宅，如今成了乡公所。五元一碗的粗茶，茶枝多于茶叶，饮来却十分解渴。喝茶时有燕子飞入屋内，仰头赫然发觉房梁上有个燕巢。这茶喝的正是客中的随意和幽情。那是四月底，我住的民宿隔壁有农家在制茶。他们把采来的茶叶小火熏蒸、揉制，然后摊在大竹匾上晾干，茶香蓬蓬而起。几十元一斤，这才是开门七件事里的茶。    《杂写》一书真是杂，内容涉及旅行、书评、影评、人物回忆、养生、拳法……其中有一篇叫《从番茄炒蛋说起》，从一盘合格的番茄炒蛋起笔，写到建筑、武功的美学，最后仍回到番茄炒蛋。“这就像想吃番茄炒蛋，是要获得最本质最习常最易辨识的那股油香、那股酸鲜与一口吞进嘴里随即而来的最初始温饱满足也。”高手往往是这样的，出尽险招，最后却稳稳收住。最后一篇访谈里，舒国治的旅行哲学（他说不敢称哲学，只是观念）给我留下了极深的印象，他说自己想去的地方，必有他想获知的东西。例如韩国庆尚北道安东的河回村，他对那里五百年前的历史感兴趣；他想从武夷山一路游到江西的铅山，因为南宋时期这一路都是书院和因科举而兴起的印书刻书的市镇……于是我便明白，他说得漫不经心其实背后是用心。    无法出门旅行的日子，也可以乘着文字的翅膀在世间嬉游、漫步。读书真是恒久的好事。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-15/7.htm,5/15/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,女孩与大师,,    沈嘉禄    有一次看电视里名人访谈节目，一位世界著名高尔夫球星回忆，四岁时被父亲带到绿茵场看比赛。小孩子还不懂游戏规则，但能够真切感受到那个气场，一大群人跟着球星移动，他到哪，掌声、笑声、欢呼声就跟到哪。“我自然而然产生了一个想法，长大后也要成为这样的人。”那位球星的话，对大多数体育明星而言，也许就是心路历程的起点。    孙女在读小学三年级，陪她做回家作业时，我从语文课本的选编中体会教育改革的良苦用心。唐诗宋词是永远的经典，练童子功必备，中外童话真是不错，让孩子从小懂得真、善、美，构建人与自然、人与动物的友好关系，在开阔视野的同时，润物细无声地进行人格教育，受益的不止是孩子，还包括陪读的家长。    孙女的学校是有着百年历史的蓬莱路第二小学，学校对素质教育十分重视，课堂内外营造的气氛一直鼓励学生博览群书，手脑并用，思维创新。老师布置的“绿色作业”最受欢迎，一张A4纸，一个主题，一组关键词或图案，剩下的交给学生自由发挥。孙女视“绿色作业”为重点，往往弄到吃晚饭也不肯收手。学校里有一个“蓬莱小镇”，为丰富课余活动而设计，户外活动之外还有各种兴趣班，比如环保、魔术、彩泥、小菜场、邮电局、空乘、西餐馆等。凡有兴趣课的那一天，孩子们放学后像一群小鸡那样奔出校门，特别开心。    学校还鼓励学生写书并组织出版！受家庭环境影响，孙女较早接触唐诗宋词、成语典故、历史人物，对《三国演义》尤感兴趣，二年级时受校长、老师鼓励，报名参加写作团队。一开始她也想写科幻或穿越，我建议她关注现实题材。小姑娘吧嗒吧嗒眨眼睛：“难道让我写游记？”我说：“你既然是少年日报的小记者，何不采访身边的艺术家呢？”    这对孩子来说是个挑战，但我必须鼓励她，为她创造条件。经过商量，最终锁定十位上海文化界的名人，书名初定为《南南公主与十位艺术大师》。南南是她的小名。    首先采访著名画家戴敦邦。巧了，戴先生早年就在蓬二小学的前身西成小学读书，一老一小是校友！采访稿写成后，校长还请戴先生回母校参观，了却老人家的心愿。接下来是江宏、江宪昆仲，分别是画家和摄影家，第四位是京剧名家关怀，第五位是书法篆刻家陆康。得知孙女要写这样一本书，大咖们都热情支持，放下身段接受她稚凤清声的采访，把她夸得心花怒放。在青浦金泽的工作室，孙女兴致勃勃地与“斜杠青年”尔冬强爷爷交流了两个多小时，从摄影到航海，从丝绸之路到中医药传播，还有丰盛的下午茶，简直乐不思蜀。要写的内容实在太多，最后写了两千字，严重超载，还被一家杂志的老总看中，刊登出来。接下来还有古建筑守护人邢伟英、歌唱家王维倩、漫画家郑辛遥，最后一位采访对象是评弹名家高博文，恰遇上海封控，只能与“吴韵一哥”视频对话，完成采访。    采访前，我先将采访对象的简历和艺术成就向孙女作一番介绍，然后一起拟定提纲，让她记在小本子上。采访时我为她做好录音，拍照合影。    将录音整理成文章，总要先拖几天，到周末有空再打草稿，稍经我修改、调整后誊抄在作文簿上。女孩子总是“作”，何况在我们家，先要来点仪式感，写到一半再涂点风油精在脑门上。背脊痒了，给她挠；指甲长了，给她剪；笔尖粗了，给她削；口渴了，赶紧倒水；肚子饿了，糕饼伺候；蚊子骚扰，奋起围剿；一声咳嗽，桉叶糖来啦！有时候她也会说：爷爷你去眯一会。眼皮刚搭拢，突听得一声喊：爷爷，缆绳的“缆”是什么偏旁？有时候她写着写着泪眼婆娑：“老师布置的作文顶多三百字，你看我已经四张纸了，脑子也要爆炸啦！”叫她休息一会又不肯，犟得很。    哄、捧、逗、噱，种种许诺，种种激励，揩眼泪，小拥抱，揪揪小耳朵，揉揉小胳膊，再不济就让她团起小花拳“咚”在我掌心里！就这样，从亲家到冤家，再从冤家到亲家，回眸时看小於菟，俯首甘为孺子牛，循环往复，春暖花开。    因为疫情，采访延续了一年多。但每次采访，都让孩子看到了一个美丽新世界，这些大咖的艺术历程以及为之付出的心血，不止是励志故事，更是人生观、价值观和世界观的“现身说法”。    五一小长假孙女也没休息，最后阶段加紧誊抄、配插图和照片、设计封面，书法篆刻家陈少峰还为她刻了一枚琥珀印章。我问孙女：写这本书，你最大的心得是什么？她眼皮一翻：做名人很累，写名人更累。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-15/8.htm,5/15/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

建起24小时待命插管分队  设置重症与普通病房“中转站”……,定点医院发力攻坚“一老一小”,,    重症监护病房里，各种仪器设备的指示灯不停闪烁。大白穿梭在病床间，脚步很快。    这里是离病毒最近的地方，也是最牵动人心的地方。医护人员每一次踏进“红区”，都是一场拼尽全力想要赢下的面对病毒的“红海行动”。    随着疫情形势的发展，上海各类方舱医院逐步进入休舱阶段，可定点医院里，“一老一小”的“攻坚硬仗”还很艰苦——    在上海中医药大学附属曙光医院（西院）市级定点医院，来自湖南、河南和广西的援沪医疗队和曙光医院医护团队一起，为重症和危重症患者带去痊愈的曙光。    在复旦大学附属儿科医院，7岁的危重症新冠患儿甜甜（化名）经过医护人员一段时间的精心救治，于昨天康复出院。    24小时待命的“特种部队”    定点医院的重症监护室里，病人床旁监护显示仪的数字一直在跳动。曙光医院呼吸科医生张艺宝正在病区巡查，在一吸一呼之间，他感觉到自己的视线渐渐模糊起来，为了看清显示仪，他的脸几乎都快贴到屏幕了，护目镜上的雾气，擦不得，透过仅剩的透明区域，他牢牢盯紧眼前的每一次变化——重症患者的生命体征监控，容不得一点点闪失。    这里主要收治黄浦、静安两区感染新冠病毒并合并有各类基础疾病的老年患者。目前收治的患者中，百岁老人有4位，90岁以上老人70多位，80岁以上老人300余位。“老年人感染新冠入院后，其基础疾病很容易迅速恶化，这对我们的救治带来了极大的困难。”定点医院医疗队领队，曙光医院副院长冯煜告诉记者，“定点医院里没有护工、工勤人员，老年病人的护理都是靠护士撑起来的。”    在定点医院，医护人员需要经常协助年长患者进行俯卧位，由于大部分患者年龄大、听力不佳，几番下来，大白搬、抬、抱“十八般武艺”都用上，往往口干舌燥、汗流浃背；而到了进餐的时间，护理小分队又走到病人床边喂饭、喂药……    气管插管是重症患者救治中积极的治疗行为。刚开始时，都是各个病区自行插管，在协调和插管程度上存在不统一。后来，曙光医院定点医院组建起一支7人的“插管小分队”，在“红区”里的缓冲区24小时待命——在武汉战疫中发挥重要作用的“特种部队”，在大上海保卫战中再次成为挽救生命的重要力量。“缓冲区到最远的病区只要5分钟，最近的病区1分钟内就可以到达，时间上的保障加大了插管后的抢救成功率。”曙光医院医务处处长张学超介绍。    曙光医院西院定点医院是临时改造的，重症监护室里原本只有12张床位，这在疫情特殊情况下显得有些稀缺了。院方加紧改造出一间介于重症病房和普通病房之间的“中转站”，收治每天巡查发现的潜在重症高危患者以及在ICU救治好转后但仍需重症康复照护的病人。而这样的阶梯式重症延伸模式，提高了ICU周转率，让更多重症患者及时得到了有效救治——也和得到国务院联防联控机制医疗救治组高度肯定、并在上海全市定点医院和方舱医院培训会上做经验分享的举措不谋而合。    三类合并基础疾病最常见    93岁的老阿婆既往有高血压、糖尿病、慢性心功能不全、慢性肾功能不全、脑梗病史，这次感染新冠病毒入院，因基础疾病心衰症状加重伴有双侧胸腔积液，于前晚由曙光西院普通病区转入重症监护室。昨天上午，经国务院联防联控机制综合组上海工作组专家邱海波教授、刘清泉教授、管向东教授，会同上海市新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组张文宏教授、张炜教授等开展中西医专家联合查房，诊断为新冠肺炎普通型、基础疾病危重型，予呼吸机辅助通气等，中医应用《上海市老年新型冠状病毒感染中医药救治工作专家共识（第二版）》中基础疾病慢性心功能不全诊治方案，给予中药汤药和中成药注射液。今天上午，患者病情已经平稳。    “新冠肺炎普通型、基础疾病危重型”，这样的诊断，或许很多人看来都觉得新鲜。“治疗新冠感染合并基础疾病，应新病宿疾并重，但要分清主次，更关注治疗基础疾病。”曙光医院肺病科主任张炜说。在临床救治上，发现老年人合并的基础疾病主要有三类：心血管有问题，特别是心功能不全；肾功能不全，存在急性肾衰竭或肾脏损伤；发生过脑血管意外或有脑血管后遗症。“对于这些的基础疾病，重症团队会更加重视，也有助于提高老年患者的救治成功率。”    此次本土疫情发生以来，“一老一少”感染者的救治受到极大关注。就在4月中旬，上海针对奥密克戎变异株发病表现，结合老年发病特点，在国家第九版诊疗方案的基础上，推出了《上海市老年新型冠状病毒感染中医药救治工作专家共识》。由于实际救治过程中的不断改进，第二版“专家共识”也于日前出炉。    “比如说，厘清基础疾病与新冠之间的主次关系，对于老年重症发展的预判，出现的中医预警因素等，我们都做了细化，有助于医护团队在早期识别容易转重的老年人，亦可精细化提高抢救的成功率。”张炜表示。    专家组在查房时认为，老年人的症状往往是比较隐匿的，比如乏力、嗜睡、胃口比较差、大便不出，这些出现在年轻人身上或许问题不大，但对老年人群而言可能就是加重的征兆。“我们发现，老年人舌苔厚腻是病情急转直下前的重要‘预警’。”在专家组的讨论中，张炜谈到了近期救治中的发现。此外，老年病人的临床检测指标如氧合指数降低、炎症因子动态升高、胸部影像学显示肺部病变明显进展等，都应尽早识别，尽早研判，尽早干预，并按重症管理。    好消息是，在援沪医疗队和曙光医院团队的共同努力下，越来越多的老年人盼来了出院的曙光。大白们说，每天最开心的事，就是看到老人康复回家。但专家也提出，虽然核酸转阴达到了出院标准，但病毒对于肺部和整个人的影响还会持续一段时间。“老年患者在健康监测期，要坚持‘两个密切’。”张炜解释，一是密切监测基础疾病的变化，例如，心肝肾功能的情况；另外，要观察患者咳嗽咳痰是否顺畅。值得关注的是，很多老年人长期卧床不起、营养状态极差，需要警惕误吸的因素——吸入性肺炎是老年人死亡的重要诱因，对于新冠恢复期的老人来说，更需要加强关注。    多学科力量护低龄患儿安康    甜甜是一名7岁的女孩，今年4月中旬不幸感染新冠病毒，她患有罕见的先天性疾病雷特综合征——这是一种严重影响儿童精神运动发育的疾病，是引起女孩重度智力障碍的主要原因。仅去年，甜甜就因严重肺炎先后六次住进儿童重症监护室，曾靠呼吸机支持治疗才渡过险关。孩子感染新冠父母本就万分焦急，此刻的甜甜，让父母更多了一份揪心和担忧。    甜甜被送到国家儿童中心复旦大学附属儿科医院后，立即被转入定点院中区的儿童新冠病房重症监护单元。早已准备就绪的新冠诊治团队，迅速展开评估救治并启动院内疑难危重专家讨论，为危重的甜甜制定精准化的诊疗方案。    据呼吸科专家、分管院中区新冠病房的儿科医院副院长张晓波教授表示，因为基础疾病的影响，甜甜的痰液特别多，自身排痰功能比较弱，平时在家里每日需要吸痰6至8次，并需要震痰机辅助排痰，甜甜感染新冠肺炎后的病情的确比较严重。    医护人员发现，甜甜的病情进展迅速，高流量吸氧已经无法维持有效的血氧饱和度，必须进行气管插管，呼吸机辅助通气。在呼吸机维持下，重症医学科医生陶金好带领团队先后三次为甜甜施行纤维支气管镜的气道冲洗与治疗；同时，呼吸治疗师和护理团队对其进行24小时不间断精心护理。    经过医护人员23个昼夜的精心治疗和护理，甜甜插管7天后成功脱离呼吸机治疗，入院14天后转为普通型，经过继续1周多的康复治疗，已达出院标准。院方介绍，作为国家儿童医学中心，复旦大学附属儿科医院在市公卫中心儿科病房、定点医院仁济南院儿科病房和万源路本部定点院中区，均集结了强大的多学科救治力量，确保危重新冠患儿第一时间得到及时精准的诊疗。    治疗期间，除了上海市新冠救治专家组提供线上会诊指导，在每日的疑难危重查房、每周两次的院内新冠专家组会诊讨论中，重症医学科、感染传染科、中医科等多学科积极参与，为甜甜拟定个性化诊治方案。全国知名的老一辈传染病专家朱启鎔，尽管已是耄耋之年的老人，也从未缺席专家组会议，始终关心甜甜的诊治过程。在救治团队的精心治疗和护理下，坚强的甜甜终于一步步闯过了难关，逐步撤离呼吸机，逐渐康复并顺利出院。    复旦大学附属儿科医院党委书记徐虹介绍，万源路本部新冠过渡病房4月4日开始收治病人，21日改造为定点院中区，72张床位中有10张危重症单元。截至昨天，定点院中区新冠病房已收治超370组染疫家庭。本报记者  郜阳  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-16/3.htm,5/16/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,商业网点越开越多  熟悉的烟火气陆续回来了,,    超市卖场打开大门迎客，餐饮门店开启线上外卖，随着商业网点越开越多，熟悉的烟火气也将重返上海。从今天开始，上海将按照“有序放开、有限流动、有效管控、分类管理”原则，分阶段推进复商复市。数据显示，上海运营的商业网点已经从最低谷的不足1400个增加到10625个，日配送订单量达到500万份。    超市卖场    更多门店线下迎客    今天上午9时，位于徐汇区的家乐福宜山店开门营业。店长陈聪站在门口，提醒进店的市民打开随申码扫一扫“数字哨兵”，再立定几秒钟完成体温测量。走进店里，蔬菜、水果、肉、蛋、奶、米面粮油与零食等一应俱全，淡水活鱼、冰鲜海鱼、鲜活小龙虾、冰鲜肉、8424西瓜、榴莲、芒果等新上市的生鲜食品备受欢迎。    “目前，我们的营业时间是早上9点到晚上6点，每天到店顾客1000人左右，下一步，或将通过延长营业时间等方式，来迎接增长的到店顾客需求。”陈聪表示，店内的民生类商品按照以往的3到5倍备货，除了线下购物，市民还能通过小程序下单、社区集单、社区团购等多种方式购物。    出于防疫考虑，联华超市田林店店里店外都画着2米线，一次只放入30人，目前每天能接待约550名消费者。“近期客单价明显提高，为满足市民需求，备货量增加到了以往的两三倍。”店长奚柏强介绍，在岗员工闭环管理，每天1次核酸2次抗原，门店每天要消杀5次以上，手推车、购物篮等物品则2小时消杀一次，“因此中午11点半到13点会闭店，一是消杀，二是补货”。    记者采访发现，作为最早纳入复工复产计划的超市卖场、便利店，“应开尽开”的脚步正明显加快。光明食品集团旗下拥有农工商超市、可的好德便利店、良友便利店等商业网点，集团表示，未来两周计划复市门店150家左右，届时，覆盖全市16个行政区的1000余家商超、便利门店的复市率将到达80%以上。    家乐福相关负责人则表示，正从安全防疫、商品备货等各方面做好全面恢复线下营业的准备。截至5月15日，家乐福上海门店基本恢复线上营业；同时其分别位于上海徐汇区、松江区、浦东新区等区域的部分门店恢复线下营业，双线服务社区消费者。    沃尔玛中国相关负责人表示，上海山姆从5月初便恢复线下营业。目前会员可在山姆App线上预约后，前往浦东高科西路店、外高桥店进行采购。    网红店、老字号    有团购也有“一件起送”    闭店近50天后，NOMAD游牧餐厅按下了复工“快进键”：从商场收集信息，门店提供保供资料，到进入“白名单”，拿到通行证，再到开店复工，只花了3天时间。隔壁的Camden's fish&  chips英式炸鱼薯条也是首批复工的商户，在平台上线外卖业务后，日销量约20单，老顾客们都说：“能吃到久违的食物，太好了！”    上述餐厅都是“魔都魅眼” FOUND158里的“网红餐厅”。“作为一个商业综合体，商户是极为重要的一个组成部分，只有让商户‘活’起来，商业氛围才会重回上海。”FOUND158相关责任人余仲佳说，截至目前，已有7家餐厅顺利复工，约占商场餐饮商家总数的46%，还有3家商户正等待复工复产的审批。    寻湘记、南京大牌档、塔哈尔、左庭右院、深井陈记烧鹅茶冰厅……在松江印象城，不仅上述网红餐厅已经复工，还有星巴克、Seesaw、代数学家等咖啡类商户也登上了团购、外卖的清单。“从5月1日开始，商场内的永辉超市就恢复线下运营了，其他部分商户则以‘闭店不停业’方式为消费者服务。”松江印象城相关负责人告诉记者，目前可以为周边居民提供服务的品牌涵盖民生保供、正餐、简餐、咖啡、百货、数码等多种业态，除了美食餐点可以通过社区团购、外卖平台送到家，商场还协助商户推出线上的健身课、艺术网课等促销活动。    上海的老字号餐饮企业也纷纷回归。淮海路上的沧浪亭、盛兴点心店、洁而精川菜馆、红房子西点和光明邨均已复工，从鲜肉月饼、大肉粽、蝴蝶酥、水果蛋糕等中西点心，到蚝油牛肉、水晶虾仁、宫保鸡丁等冷鲜半成品，均能配送到家。南京路步行街上的邵万生则在社区团购之外，推出了“一件派发”服务，既有包含特色糟肉粽在内的粽子礼盒，也有适合上海人口味的熟食套餐、腌腊套餐。杏花楼则以每天6到8家门店的速度复工，在美团、饿了么平台上，粽子套餐、点心套餐、熟食套餐、方便菜套餐等均是一份起送。  本报记者  张钰芸    “一口鲜香”南翔小笼全力送    清晨6时不到，位于嘉定区南翔老街的百年老店长兴楼内，点心师傅吴海英一大早就开始忙碌了。和面醒面，准备馅料，轻压面团，仔细捏褶……在她的巧手下，一只只玲珑雪白的南翔小笼很快制成。“摸到这皮子，我的心一下就踏实了。”到了营业时间，已有数百只在案板上排得整整齐齐。    “再加两份小笼！”另一边，长兴楼负责人陈爱根的手机不断响铃，那是一笔笔订单来了。叠得高高的蒸笼内，热气里的小笼皮薄汁多，鲜香扑鼻。据了解，现蒸出炉的小笼目前只在南翔镇范围配送；全市其他地区，则以冷冻小笼为主，安排符合要求的冷链车配送。    “制作冷冻小笼，我们采用七分熟的工艺。这样一来，面皮是熟的、肉是生的，汤汁就牢牢锁在了里面。”陈爱根介绍，等七分熟小笼凉透后，会冷冻10小时，再通过冷链车送到顾客手上，都是当天做当天送，“这些小笼我们现在还是以团购为主，冷冻起来可以储存一个月。热水烧开后蒸上6分钟，就能尝到几乎和堂食一样的美味”。    目前，恢复营业已近一周的长兴楼仅提供外送服务，但是店内已做好复商复市了准备。“比疫情前更忙了，我一天要接上千个电话，都是顾客订购。”陈爱根说，光是昨天一天，店里就做了7000多只小笼，“说明上海老百姓都想念这一口味道。我们也做好了十足的准备，迎接这座城市恢复如常的那一天”。本报记者  杨洁    “头势清爽”理发店限流迎客    “小王，我来理个发！”今天一早，在松江区岳阳街道，家住北九峰小区的居民王一山按照约定时间，来到他常去的婧芹理发店。扫好“场所码”、测量体温后，店主王宝芹认真查看了老人的48小时核酸阴性报告，并将他引导到店内洗发、剪发。    作为岳阳街道首家开市迎客的理发店，王宝芹配合街道完成了预约限流、验“场所码”、环境消杀等一系列防疫措施，今起对外营业。    洗发、修剪、吹风……不过十余分钟，王一山便顶着清爽的新发型愉快地走出店门：“剪完感觉整个人都松快了不少，‘头势清爽’，舒服！”“按照街道安排，我们采用了事先预约和错峰到店的措施进行限流。”王宝芹介绍，目前店内仅提供理发业务。    据了解，截至昨天，松江已累计线下复业261家卖场、超市、便利店等；而属地街镇也结合民生需要和群众呼声，逐步开放辖区门店复商复业。    “目前岳阳辖区已有270余家门店线上或线下复业，主要涉及母婴店、餐饮、商超、便利店及药店等六大类民生保供门店。”岳阳街道营商办负责人陶蕾介绍，由于近期居民们理发和宠物护理的呼声非常高，街道也第一时间为理发店及宠物店率先落实审批及复业程序，接下来也会陆续有序地推动相关行业及门店在落实防疫保障的前提下进行复商复业，为居民提供高效优质的消费服务。    本报通讯员  李爽  记者  杨洁    咖啡飘香  枫泾古镇在复苏    文中路是金山枫泾古镇最文艺的一条街。疫情发生后，沿街的茶馆、咖啡店、奶茶店均配合防疫要求暂停营业。时隔近两个月后，沉寂已久的文中路又悄然飘起了熟悉的茶香、咖啡香……    今天一早，位于文中路36号的半塘咖啡店店主金珍珠在开门前一小时就抵达店里，“关门了近两个月，里里外外都要收拾。”消毒餐具、擦拭桌椅、调试机器、打扫店铺……据金珍珠介绍，当前根据疫情防控和商业网点恢复营业的相关规定，目前店铺无法堂食，只提供外卖或打包外带服务。顾客到店后，均需在门口扫描“场所码”，进行行程码和健康码查验，测温后才能点餐购买，将咖啡带回家。    开门首日，咖啡店的客流量虽然不比往常，但老顾客们的支持却一直都在。“阿姨，好久不见啊，打包5杯拿铁。”对咖啡的热爱，让李女士在外出采购的同时也不忘来店购买咖啡，“看到老板娘的朋友圈说开门营业了，就赶紧过来，顺便再给朋友捎几杯。”对李女士而言，咖啡不仅仅是提神饮品，更标志着生活逐步回归正常。    据悉，枫泾镇目前有664家“白名单”商业网点恢复营业。在“白名单”管理过程中实行“动态管理”，会安排巡查队伍每天3-4次定组定时定段包干巡查。在此过程中，一旦发现有商业网点没有达到相关防疫规定和要求的，取消“白名单”资格，责令其停营。    本报记者  屠瑜  通讯员  朱丽燕    “有限开放”崇明集市已迎客    疫情防控形势趋稳，崇明有序推进集贸市场复工复市。今天，崇明首批集贸市场实现“有限开放”，分别是庙镇菜场、新村菜场。    在庙镇菜场入口处，佩戴口罩的市民们在志愿者的引导下使用“数字哨兵”进行测温、扫码核验、身份登记，凭购物证排队入场，现场秩序井然。菜场内，摊位上摆放了蔬菜、肉类、鲜活水产、豆制品等，货源供应充足、商品价格平稳。据了解，目前开放的摊位主要以群众需求量大的产品为主。    在昨天的压力测试后，今日庙镇菜场正式“有限开放”。为减少人员聚集，庙镇按照片区分流、时段分流、人数分流的形式，为村居民发放购物凭证，让他们在指定时间到菜场购物。另外，在开放的集贸市场安排了志愿者等工作人员维持进场秩序；对菜场内部限制瞬时人流，并分开设置出入口，避免人流对冲。    今早，在严格落实疫情防控要求前提下，新村乡实行区域限定、时间限定、人数限定、品种限定、渠道限定，有条件恢复新村菜场社会面营业。各村、各企业根据指定时段凭券前往购物；菜场内部摊位根据群众需求，分类有序逐步开放。目前，蔬菜和水产品货源均为新村乡自产自销。    本报记者  李一能  通讯员  范立    江南造船按期交付疫情下首艘船    今天上午，由中国船舶集团旗下江南造船为浦银租赁和山东海洋集团下属太平洋气体船（香港）控股有限公司（PACIFIC   GAS）建造的99000立方米B型舱超大型乙烷运输船H 2625船（VLEC）“PACIFIC   INEOS GRENADIER”交付。这是江南造船在兼顾疫情防控和生产运行的同时，按期交付的第一艘船。    记者了解到，该船是全球第一型具备防疫符号（IDM-A）的民用商船，强化的卫生防疫隔离系统可有效阻断、控制新冠等传染性疾病的传播风险，增强了疫情应对能力。    据悉，在公司防疫工作组、配套部的帮助下，交船团队在严格落实执行疫情防控指令的前提下，精细策划交船方案：一是对交船前的施工项目计划进行重新编排，对风险项目进行评估并制定有针对性的应对措施；二是采取设备供应商实时视频连线指导、自主调试的“云调试”方案，总装二部、模块部先后完成该船十余项重要设备系统的调试报验工作；三是关注外包服务商专项策划，精准管控，在公司度过静默期后上船施工，及时完成服务项目。

近日，上海市经信委先后发布了两批“应用数字化解决方案  助力复工复产”公益名单，黑湖科技旗下的“黑湖智造”与“黑湖小工单”双双入选。    “黑湖智造”是一个工业协同SaaS（软件服务化）平台，可以为制造型企业提供基于云端的数据协同和分析。通过它，工厂里的每一位员工都能进行全局动态实时数据的收集与上传，计划与采购、仓储、车间及时共享数据，就能提高部门间的协同效率。工人们也能从繁冗的统计工作中释放出来，全身心投入到紧张的复工复产中去。    “人手不足，物料有限，是复工复产企业面临的共性问题。”黑湖科技企业传播负责人刘依依说，这些情况带来的衍生问题，就是人手和物流如何调配，哪些订单应该优先生产，实际交付期又在何时。过去大多依靠厂长的既往经验做出判断，但其精准度不高，数字化解决方案不但能精准地掌握数据，给出效率更高的生产计划，还能做到计划被100%执行，最大化地利用现有资源。    截至5月13日，上海已推动三批“白名单”企业3000多家复工复产，整体复工率超过70%，其中首批666家企业复工率已超95%。在疫情防控的特殊时期，数字化技术产品正是保驾护航复工复产的关键角色。记者了解到，目前黑湖科技已经对接上海区域内近百家生物医疗器械、汽车零部件、食品饮料、日化等行业的企业、工厂，为他们提供数字化解决方案，尽快提高生产效率，交出复工复产的满意“答卷”。本报记者  张钰芸    火车站到发列车数今起逐步增加    上海本轮疫情暴发以来，铁路一直没有关闭过进出上海的通道，不过由于多种因素叠加，最少时上海出发（含始发和途经上海并办理上下客业务，下同）的列车单日只有4趟。当前，本市疫情防控正处于应急处置向常态化防控转换的关键阶段，也确实有不少旅客有必要的出沪需求，上海出发的列车单日开行量也有所增加，今天上海虹桥站办理出发客票的有12趟列车。    目前上海三大火车站中，上海南站尚无进出上海的客运列车，上海站只有一趟从合肥开来的到达客运列车，上海虹桥站是唯一一个既有出发客车又有到达客车的火车站。上海铁路部门每天根据上级的调度命令，办理当天在虹桥站的上下客业务，而列车的车次、方向是动态变化的。昨天虹桥站出发列车是12趟，出发旅客人数6000余人；到达旅客人数近1000人。    今天，上海虹桥站出发列车为12趟，包含1趟始发列车（上海虹桥站至北京南站的G10次列车）、11趟途经列车（主要目的地方向为杭州、南京、合肥、南昌等），确实有必要离沪需求的旅客，可以根据自己的目的地，在12306网站或App上搜索查询是否有自己需要的列车开行。    随着疫情防控逐步稳定向好，铁路部门也将逐步增加上海虹桥站、上海站等车站的到发列车数量，逐步恢复正常运行。目前，有600多名铁路职工在上海各火车站坚守岗位，闭环作业，每天坚持业务培训、设备检修等，为后续列车大规模恢复开行做好准备。本报记者

历时21小时35分钟，穿越1700多公里,生命最后时刻只想陪儿中考  癌症晚期的广西爸爸回家了,,"    5月15日16时，一辆来自上海的别克商务车驶入广西柳州道口。面对守候多时的防疫人员，步履蹒跚走下车子的广西爸爸黄先生不禁掩面而泣：“回来了！回来了！儿子，我能陪着你中考了……”历时21小时35分钟，穿越1700多公里，这场由新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”牵头的暖心护送，画上圆满句号。    本报记者  季晟祯  钱俊毅    时间回溯到5月13日中午12时,当新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”紧急热线求助直播，接到“胰腺癌晚期的广西爸爸在生命最后时刻，想回家陪着儿子中考”的求助后，“战疫·帮侬忙”随即开启“全城救助”。    5月14日19时25分起，上海裕皖实业发展有限公司派出别克商务车，由郑洲、汪纯两位师傅组成“护送二人组”，送广西爸爸回家看儿子——1700多公里转运开启！浙江嘉兴“爸爸疼了妈妈晕车”、江西上饶“遭遇拥堵交警给力”、湖南醴陵“吃完了药继续出发”……在今日头条、抖音开启的“在沪病危爸爸想陪儿子中考，上海到柳州1700公里转运”慢直播中，每一次“艰难曲折”都牵动着百万网友的心。新华社、柳州日报、南国今报等同步拉流直播，全网观看总数达274.5万。    5月15日16时许    广西柳州道口    广西爸爸回来了    5月15日16时许，历经21小时35分钟的连夜奔波，穿越1700多公里，由郑洲、汪纯组成的“护送二人组”将广西爸妈送达柳州。一下车，看着周围熟悉的环境，广西妈妈杨女士难掩激动之情：“谢谢大家一路陪伴！谢谢‘新民·帮侬忙’，让我们看到了希望，让各方伸出了援手。”    随后，在视频电话中，上海裕皖实业发展有限公司董事长余承涛表示：“我代表公司承诺，会资助孩子到大学毕业。”站在一旁的广西爸爸听后，眼睛里噙满了泪水：“我家孩子很乖，读书真的很好。这个社会真的好人多哦。”    郑洲、汪纯马上就要驾车闭环折返上海了，但黄先生和杨女士一直不肯离去，“这一路，小郑和小汪都没好好吃过一顿热饭，能不能让他们吃上一碗柳州螺蛳粉再离开？”不到十分钟，在防疫人员安排下，一碗热气腾腾的螺蛳粉来了。看着两人狼吞虎咽的样子，杨女士笑了。    这时，又有很多柳州市民闻讯送来了当地特产。杨女士把这一份份沉甸甸的感激塞进了车里，“帮我带给所有帮过我们的人，这是柳州人的心意。”    5月16日8时    柳州隔离酒店    想去拍张全家福    今天上午8时，昨天下午就已被送到隔离酒店的广西爸妈给记者打来了电话。“好不容易回到了家乡，我和孩子的爸爸一早就醒了。”杨女士说，考虑到病人只能喝流食，柳州防疫部门特批，家属可每日送餐到隔离酒店。“他刚喝了妹妹送来的鸡蛋粥，我早饭吃了肠粉，两个多月第一次吃到家乡的食物，感觉特别好。”    “儿子昨晚下自习，得知我们回到了柳州，都乐坏了。”杨女士告诉记者，“为了不影响孩子学习，我们在上海每周只和他通一次视频通话。老师讲，孩子最近的学习成绩突飞猛进，经常在班级名列前茅。我们不在家的日子，他真的懂事长大了。”话到此处，视频连线中，杨女士握紧了丈夫的手，“你要坚持住，要看着儿子中考、高考、进大学……我们家不能没有你。”    14天隔离结束后，广西爸妈就能陪着儿子中考了。当被问及还有什么心愿时，杨女士顿了一下，“孩子爸爸打算带我们去拍一张全家福。”    5月16日9时许    湖南荣家湾服务站附近    人能歇车不能歇    “今天2点多，我们睡了一会儿，现在刚启程出发，看导航，快到荣家湾服务站了。”驱车回沪途中的汪纯表示，今天凌晨时分，他和搭档郑洲实在“撑不住”了，把车停在湘阴服务区旁后，窝在车里就沉沉睡去。等再次醒来，天已大亮了。    说起1700多公里的穿越护送，汪纯和郑洲讲，当时他们唯一的念头：时间不等人，人能歇车不能歇。“虽然叔叔已经没有力气说话了，但我看得出，他渴望早点回家见到儿子。”三年前，母亲身患癌症，郑洲曾陪着她四处求医。对于广西爸爸的遭遇，他感同身受。    让汪纯和郑洲最感到幸福的是：一路上他们并不孤单，有百万网友线上守护。“不少人还夸我们‘很上镜’呢，老家安徽的亲人直夸我们‘做得好’！”    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月14日11时至5月16日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求461件，其中紧急类诉求184件，已推动解决147件（含“公益联盟”31件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-16/6.htm,5/16/22,第6版:综合新闻,,False
,人品比美食更美的朱师傅,,    邓伟志    书架上有本书，书名叫《百位名厨》。其中有位朱师傅，是我邻居。我与他已有近半个世纪的交情。这百位名厨都会做色味俱佳的多种菜肴，但是书里只许他们一人选一种自己最拿手的品种介绍。老朱在这本书里讲他最拿手的是做肉丸子。    他做的肉丸子确实让人一吃难忘。有次他知道我们两口子中午去他家，便让他夫人一大早去买肉做肉丸子给我们吃。他一看，夫人买的肉尽管很好，可不是做肉丸子的最佳材料，他连忙再自己跑到菜市场里买肉，亲自掌厨。他的肉丸子就是不同一般，油而不腻，粘中有脆，我们吃得津津有味。    朱师傅的菜好，人品更好。他乐于助人。他把徒弟视若亲子，耐心教诲。他办训练班，传授技艺。有一年我生病住院。他一遍又一遍地问我想吃点什么，我说想吃菜包子。我想这对他来说并不难。想不到，他第二天送来的包子不是他做的，也不是买的，是他请《百位名厨》中以做菜包子出名的大厨做的，鲜美多汁。我吃了精神陡然振奋，病情大为减轻。    朱师傅德艺双馨，教子有方。他教育子女学会成人之美，多做善事。子女没有辜负他的教导。儿子是上海大学校友，毕业后从商。几年前，他们公司为上大捐款，传为美谈。他女儿与我女儿在高安路小学是同班同学，学习成绩一直领先。    今年，老朱女儿特地在母亲节那天，买了两大包菜包子，一包送她自己的妈妈，一包送给也被她称“妈妈”的我发妻。我发妻手捧着包子，连连说“孝顺！孝顺！真是远亲不如近邻”。此时虽然因为疫情，孩子不在跟前，但我们仍像是握着她温暖的手，握着老朱全家人的手……,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-16/7.htm,5/16/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,“团干部”,,    程小莹    朱新璠、鲍绥红夫妇所居小区，从2022年3月16日开始封控。    鲍绥红告诉我说——记得我们小区第一次做核酸检测的时候，那天是中午，人头攒动。秩序有点乱。二十人一组。朱新璠在排队——这个人你晓得的呀，有事情憋不住的，要讲的。他对维持秩序的“大白”讲：这种排队检测就是人群聚集，会有风险。工作人员朝他看看，无言以对。边上的鲍绥红轻轻拉了把朱新璠：你不要多讲了。大家都不容易。要么，我们考虑一下，去做志愿者？相帮做点事情吧。    夫妻俩会心一笑。    我认识他们，是五十年前的事情了。眼睛一眨。1973年，我中学毕业进上海第十二棉纺织厂技校读书。朱新璠已经是这家七千余人大厂的团委副书记了。鲍绥红是细纱车间的团干部，后来做车间团总支书记、党总支书记。近年来，因为我的一些关于工厂的写作，陆续耳闻往昔工厂的人物与故事，便听得疫情期间的那些普通人的“战疫”经历——    次日，朱新璠、鲍绥红夫妻俩就找到小区居委会报名当志愿者：“我们都是共产党员。”但这对夫妻出示身份证登记时，居委会干部告知，上面有规定年满70周岁就不接受了。“你们回家自己多保重身体吧。”    这两人年过七十，外表还真看不出，内心，则保有一份真心——我们就做些力所能及的事情吧。鲍绥红说，他俩自己配制84消毒药水，每天对本楼栋的楼道和电梯进行两次喷洒消杀。对门的租户是三个外来打工的小妹妹，自己不会做消杀，他们负责提供自己配制的消毒药水。    疫情期间，鲍绥红会做皮蛋瘦肉粥，带鱼粥，八宝辣酱，腌制白萝卜，酸辣泡菜；平时扔了的香莴笋叶子，她用来烧菜饭，一来调剂胃口，二来是真的要省着点。“我总要省一点，这样万一在人家需要接济一下的时候，可以拿点出来救急。我们过去在厂里都是做过群众工作的，晓得这个时候，大家应该有个啥样子。我们也做不了什么大的事情，就做点自己做得到的。”    侯野薇会过日子，疫情期间，一边为本小区居民领发物资，一边为小区居民算经济账。物资紧缺，组团网购算下来是有点贵的，她决意为小区居民组团网购平价蔬菜；使命必达。看她的账单——小豌豆10元3斤，螺蛳15元3斤，茄子7元一斤，其他诸如西瓜等，几乎与市场平价。    小区门卫保安，封控一个月，晚上睡物业办公室，没床。到第六天，侯野薇发现了，将此情报到志愿者微信群里，得到重视，物业经理送来了行军床。那天，保安对侯野薇说——我今天总算能脱了衣服睡个好觉了。更令人感动的是，保安没衣服换洗，侯野薇将自家先生新的内衣、袜子送来。做过纺织厂生活的女人，热心肠，也心思缜密，晓得嘘寒问暖；男人还要有得吃——侯野薇经常给保安去送虎皮蛋红烧肉，小龙虾，星巴克咖啡。    说起团购，曾经的团干部，后来担任副厂长的宋慧珍，也有故事。她说，刚进入小区购物群，被要求用楼栋号楼层号做自己的微信用名，她在手机上弄了半天，便在微信名后加上一串阿拉伯数字——楼栋号和楼层号。晚上，女儿看不懂，来电问：“老妈您怎么在微信名后加一串数字，怪怪的。”她说是团购要求填的呀。女儿笑了，教她在购物群“聊天信息”栏下拉至“我在群里的昵称”，其中注上楼栋号楼层号即可。    购物清单出来了，宋慧珍看见有许多姓名后面拖一串阿拉伯数字的朋友。跟她差不多的。一一致电，校正。也算学得一项手机使用技能。    白惠群是我技校同学，也做过团干部。她说的事情，我觉得比较有味道——她住底楼，有小院，邻家种竹，春笋透过院墙冒到她家院落。邻里致意——你们不如挖笋，做菜食之，尝鲜。也解燃眉之急。应了老话：“宁可食无肉，不可居无竹。”我特意跟白惠群确认——你真的做菜吃了？答曰，腌笃鲜与油焖笋。白惠群感慨——也许以后再也吃不到那样的口感和美味了。    这个城市的工人阶级，曾经是中国第一代产业工人，几代人，从20世纪50年代，翻身当家做主人，到60、70年代，工人阶级是领导阶级的担当，他们其实就是一颗螺丝钉，拧紧在国家最底层的部落，大多数默默无闻。当城市危难之际，他们挺身而出，重新将自己这颗螺丝钉拧紧在城市最基层的细部，直抵人心。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-16/8.htm,5/16/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

抗疫形势正在好转，积极信号不断释放，临港不断传来新消息,堵车了，但我从没这么开心过,,    本报记者  杨欢    从市区开车到临港，车流渐渐增多。在两港大道快速道S2高速路口还遇到堵车，集卡、重卡排队核验电子通行证和核酸码后，驶往东海大桥方向。这让记者很兴奋，因为城市在复苏，活力又回来了。    城市因疫情按下“暂停键”，无数人与病毒抗争。眼下形势正在好转，不断释放的积极信号，让人相信，期盼已久的生活恢复如常指日可待。上个月中旬，从临港传来的两则消息颇受关注。4月18日，上汽集团正式启动复工复产压力测试。4月19日，特斯拉上海工厂8000名员工返岗。这两家汽车领域的龙头企业复工复产，意义非凡。据上海市经济信息化委主任吴金城介绍，上海重点产业链有序复工，如汽车领域，上汽乘用车、上汽通用、上汽大众、特斯拉四家整车企业全面复工，基本实现连续稳定生产，每天下线整车约2000辆，带动上下游1100多家零部件配套企业恢复生产。    这些数据，让记者欣喜，也由此决定，去临港看一看企业复工复产的情况。    目前，临港管委会的工作人员分成两批，24小时在岗。内场的人闭环管理，负责线上审批、协调、决策等，吃住都在办公室。外场直接对接企业，高科、建交、综保等几个主要部门的副处长领着“兵”，现场督导、协调，帮助企业复工复产。    记者联系了临港管委会高新产业和科技创新处的外场工作负责人李向聪。原本约的采访时间是13时30分，但他一直在忙，和内场工作人员开线上会议，聊一个招商项目推进中遇到的问题，准备拉相关部门一起协调。    等待间隙，记者环绕四周。一个小伙子席地而坐，抱着电脑整理数据，背后的沙发上散落着被子。显然，这段时间，他是睡沙发的。小伙子叫王彬，浙大毕业的高材生，95年生，今年1月份刚刚选调到临港。一开始，管委会排班，准备A班先值一周，之后再换B班。结果交接时，B班缺一个人，值完A班的王彬就主动请缨留下来，一留就留到了现在，被同事们开玩笑说，“穿着棉袄来，穿着短袖走。”    临港管委会里，这样肯吃苦、敢担当的年轻人还有很多。    大家很忙，记者只能见缝插针地采访，从下午1点聊到晚上9点。有人进组前囤了箱胡辣汤，吃了一个多月，还剩最后一包。用开水兑一兑，配上已经放冷的盒饭，算是欢迎宴。    胡辣汤尝起来，酸、咸、麻辣，但吃完之后口舌回甘，而这些抗疫人员的经历，正好与之一一对应。    酸——腰酸背痛    睡杂物间，放倒柜子当床    忙了一下午，李向聪都没离开过座位。吃晚饭的时候，一直按肩颈，老毛病又犯了。之前内场值班时，大伙都在办公室里睡行军床。他脊椎不好，就一个人跑到杂物间里，把柜子放倒当硬板床睡。到外场后，有床了，但大伙也没什么时间休息，有时，坐车去园区的路上，眯十几分钟。    目前，高科处在外场的有17个人，要负责管理临港企业的驻厂、返岗人员。随着复工复产推进，人数每天都在变。他们要组织企业做核酸检测、送抗原、送物资、统计数据整理台账，还要解决员工的“急难愁盼”，比如就医、配药。    复工复产方面，企业先提交申请，管委会内场审批，外场保障协调。复工复产方案里，静默区设置、现场消杀、防疫物资准备等，都得写清楚。高科处会“飞行检查”，发现问题，督促整改。    麻——任务繁重    工科男防疫，方法很“硬核”    企业分散在不同区域里，管理起来难度不小。高科处外场的17个人分为9组，各有分工。划分得精准，不能简单按园区面积分，因为企业员工有多有少。核酸点位设置在哪，顺序怎么排，走什么线路，都得是“最优解”。    高科处里基本都是工科生，逻辑思维比较强。搞招商的时候，他们就画了产业地图。这次，也把经验用到疫情防控里。有个年轻人叫王志阳，是从企业借调过来的，防疫期间，做了很多“攻略图”。他把核酸检测点位分布，车辆运行线路，每个区块谁负责，画得一清二楚。    “一开始，我们通宵开会，就讨论台账怎么弄。现在机制理顺了，繁杂的工作处理起来也有头绪了。”王志阳说的台账就是整理数据做统计，这是个繁杂的活。比如，特斯拉上海工厂8000名员工返岗，分散在各处。高科处要开证明，开通行证，梳理名单。统计数据时，姓名、地址、手机号码、核酸码、车牌号等都要记录好，容不得差错。    咸——流汗流泪    徒手搬物资，女神成“汉子”    每天都很累，但年轻人擅长“自嘲”，苦中作乐。王志阳手机里保存了很多小伙伴的“黑照”。    有张照片很吸睛。一个瘦小的姑娘搬着很重的物资，脸上青筋凸起，头发散乱地抓了个冲天辫，“女汉子”气十足。她叫刘通，是个“90后”姑娘，说话很温柔。刘通3月份才到管委会报道，就跟着来外场参与疫情防控了。什么活都跟着一起干，搬1000箱物资没叫过苦。结果在一次核酸检测现场，她哭了。    大家每天睡得很晚，要等做核酸的具体通知，第二天起大早去现场布置。一次，刘通在维持秩序，引导大家保持间距排队。有些工人没戴好口罩，她上前劝阻，对方反倒把口罩往下一拉。刘通气得眼泪夺眶而出，默默拿着喷壶消毒，然后继续沟通，“你们跟我父母差不多大，也有子女在外工作。不希望他们在外受委屈吧。大家都有难处，但还是要互相理解配合。”一番话打动所有人，后面进展就很顺利了。    甜——难忘回忆    我们爱她，希望她越来越好    “疫情下的‘特斯拉速度’能在临港产生，也侧面印证了新片区汽车产业链的集聚。这些整车企业有大量供应商，如果分散在各地，进度就没这么快，集聚在临港，协调起来就比较方便。”作为特斯拉上海超级工厂的服务专员之一，高科处奚涛三句话离不开业务。采访结束时，也不忘给临港新片区“打广告”。    这段时间也将是大家的难忘回忆。高科处外场的17个人中，刘通是甘肃的，刘显哲是辽宁的，王海鹏是山东的，王志阳和李向聪是河南的，刘国舜是广西的，沈稼鸣、倪岑岑、高泽骏、张旭卿和曹阳是江苏的，王骁、王彬、蒋东新、周洲、吕浩和奚涛是上海的。为了投身新片区建设，他们成了“临港人”。“因为深爱这座城市，希望她越来越好。”    截至5月16日，临港新片区复工复产工业企业477家。其中，规上工业企业301家，占全部规上企业总量的95.6%。477家企业合计返岗及驻厂人数超5万。目前，上汽集团临港乘用车工厂，特斯拉上海工厂，新昇、积塔、三一、上海电气、航发商发、上飞制造等近20家企业也实现了封闭生产或研发；格科、重燃等8个重大项目已复工。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/3.htm,5/17/22,第3版:要闻,,False
,金融守“沪”多家外企表示有信心,,    对很多在陆家嘴上班的金融从业者来说，刚过去的4月，疫情凶猛，但中国金融的这颗“心脏”，跳得还算平稳。    上海是我国金融要素市场最为集聚的城市之一。本轮疫情以来，各大金融要素市场通过加强数据备份和安全管理，安排核心人员现场办公，确保交易不中断。金融监管部门也开启24小时值守，保证各大金融要素市场平稳运转。    值守全天候    基本功能不打折扣    刚刚过去的近两个月，很多人的生活都被按下了暂停键，但包括证券、期货、外汇在内的金融要素市场均正常开市。疫情之下，“上海价格”也持续输出。    在位于浦东的上海证券交易所内，审核、发行、再融资、债券融资等业务都如常运作，资本市场直接融资的基本功能不打折扣。    为确保交易业务平稳安全运行，上交所对交易业务运行核心人员实施闭环管理，一方面组织核心交易系统业务操作人员在金桥灾备基地集中封闭，另一方面组建业务运行最小团队24小时驻所办公，并启用远程办公等措施。此外，上交所还准备了一支50人规模的核心交易备用团队，驻外高桥办公；在居家办公人员中保留一支10人规模的“火种”团队，以应对可能的极端突发情形。    不远处的上海期货交易所内，交易繁忙情况同样不逊往日。    上海期货交易所交易部相关负责人表示，疫情以来，上期所一是通过标准仓单平台线上质押业务、期货稳价订单、免收交割手续费等多项措施，助力企业纾困解难；二是协调仓库、税务机关、会员公司等多方，保障交割相关工作顺利进行；三是全力支持会员单位技术运维，目前会员各项业务均平稳运行。    今年1-3月，相关企业通过上期标准仓单交易平台开展线上质押融资业务，获得银行贷款7.98亿元，贷款的平均利率在4%左右，相比行业平均降低5-6个百分点，一定程度上缓解了企业的资金压力；“期货稳价订单”工具持续发挥功能，已有6家生产加工型企业通过该业务订购了7.55万吨热轧卷板，其采购成本也得到了封顶保障。    金融“后援团”    助力企业纾困解难    当下，为助力企业复工复产，金融机构还充当强大的“后援团”。目前，上海银保监局对银行保险机构的信贷投放、无缝续贷等业务进行监测，同时，及时监测400余万个企业银行账户的流水进出、工资发放等情况，捕捉疫情对金融和企业两端的影响，为复工复产决策提供依据。上海多家银行、保险公司也先后出台了“稳链保供”等多项纾困举措。    保险公司也在及时“输血”。    虽然疫情为出口增添了困难，交易仍要继续，海外市场更不能放弃。中国信保上海分公司责无旁贷担负起了为企业保订单、稳出口的政策性职责。该公司一方面提高风险容忍度，加大限额支持力度，助企业增强交易信心，保障海外市场稳定；另一方面加大出口前承保支持，提高审批效率，提高承保支持效果，满足市场需求。3月疫情封控以来，支持上海地区投保企业获得新批复限额近2400个，合计金额超过28亿美元，较去年同期增长48%，限额批复满足率超过90%，较去年全年提升2个百分点，遥遥领先于全系统平均水平。    还有部分金融人疫情期间工作时长不减反增——中国银行上海总部最近连续开展了数场跨时区路演，为全球国际金融中心的资产管理行业组织、境外投资机构深度解读中国资本市场的投资机遇，提振国际机构投资者的信心。    国际投资者    坚定看好上海未来    事实上，国际机构投资者对上海的信心也并未受到动摇。    记者从上海市地方金融监管局获悉：尽管受到疫情影响，多家国际资管机构仍积极申请上海合格境外有限合伙人（即股权基金的出资人，QFLP）和合格境内有限合伙人（QDLP）试点，参与上海全球资产管理中心建设。这些机构表示，坚定看好上海国际金融中心未来发展，深耕中国市场中长期规划没有改变。    据介绍，先后有汉领资本、建银国际、鼎晖投资、集富亚洲（二期）四家机构在近期申请参与合格境外有限合伙人（QFLP）试点；贝莱德基金、安中投资两家机构申请参与合格境内有限合伙人（QDLP）试点。    此外，还有多家国际资管机构看好上海未来发展，计划加大在华业务，提交了追加试点额度的申请。日前，瑞信投资、品浩投资、瑞锐投资三家QDLP试点机构分别获准追加额度2亿美元、2亿美元、1亿美元，获准总额度分别达到4亿美元、4亿美元、1.5亿美元；海纳华、信旌投资两家QFLP试点机构分别追加0.7亿美元、5亿美元投资额度，获准总额度分别达到7亿美元、10亿美元。此外，路博迈和橡树投资等机构也正在计划追加试点额度，进一步做大在沪资管业务。    本报记者  杨硕,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/4.htm,5/17/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,为居民团购一分也不能赚,“三个一分钱”党员志愿者服务队牵头人金涛带领大家坚持平价保供,    一板正大蛋业的品牌鸡蛋30只，他们为老百姓团购一直卖27到30元钱，因为太便宜反遭投诉。在物流不畅，物资紧缺的时候，这样一支临时拼凑的队伍，是如何做到一直坚持出厂价不加一分钱，志愿者不经手一分钱，团队不谋一分钱私利？昨日，“三个一分钱”党员志愿者服务队牵头人金涛向记者讲述了背后的故事。    组织“店小二”团队    作为市级机关的党员干部，金涛的本职工作是联系农村党建。浦西封控初期，朋友向他求助，说小区没有物资了。于是，他帮忙联系购买到了400包大米。第一单做成后，一传十，十传百，别人知道他有平价的渠道后，纷纷来求助。两天多时间，就供应了2000多包米。    因为每天只能睡1小时，他感到体力不支，于是，他在朋友圈发动志同道合的人一起参与，特别强调：“机关同志优先，封控在家有时间，电话24小时畅打不休息，没有任何物质报酬和精神奖励，没有职务级别高低之分。”    消息一发出去，很多人来报名，他们组成了一支21人的党员志愿者服务队。大家从机关干部、国企领导、学校老师、企业职工、科研尖兵，变身为线上低价卖菜、卖瓜、卖米、卖蛋、卖肉、卖酱油的“店小二”。例如，来自上海交大的闵楠，为了做好练塘茭白的助农服务，几乎一夜之间转型成农业专家。来自上海航天机电的徐悦雯，专司金山廊下蔬菜，每天都在为了市民明天餐桌上吃什么绿叶菜绞尽脑汁……    物美价廉不怕举报    他们坚持“三个一分钱”工作原则，即：出厂价不加价一分钱、志愿者不经手一分钱、团队不谋一分钱私利。无数次，为了一枚摔坏的鸡蛋、一片压烂的菜叶、一包压扁的番茄、一串有黑斑的香蕉、一只长得难看的苹果、一瓶碰碎的酱油，为了封控社区居民的吃饭问题，他们操碎了心。    他们还要和保供厂家谈：“现在是疫情非常时期，不能只考虑经济利益，要讲社会责任。我们不赚一分钱，也希望你们能帮忙解决物流，给到居民平价优质的物资。”他们还要和团长谈：“你们要拿到这么好的东西，唯一的要求就是不加一分钱，物资到了后1个小时内能够送到居民手中。”也有团长向金涛表示，分发物资有困难，没人干。金涛就让他们去找居民区书记，发动党员一起做。    0.9-1元/只的鲜鸡蛋、1.25元/包加碘盐、2元/斤球生菜、2.2元/包康师傅……慢慢地，这支队伍的口碑也做出来了，至今已卖出1000吨生活物资。因为物美价廉，他们还遭到恶意举报，说他们扰乱市场秩序。队伍里由于有市市场监管局的同志，对于恶意举报，他们并不害怕。    感恩爱心伙伴支持    渐渐地，会有爱心企业找上门，想要捐物资。“他们不知道我们没有仓库、没有运输，都是一群线上志愿者，但我们还是硬着头皮接了下来，只要是人家支持上海抗疫的物资，我们一定想尽办法接收。”金涛说。    最让他感动的是叫徐凯的爱心企业家。4月19日，徐凯联系到他，说要捐350头猪给上海。他问：“需要办很多手续，如果这事办不成，猪怎么办？”“我今晚开始杀猪，你们肯定办得成！”徐凯答道。    当晚，徐凯从云南派出两大卡车，运出700爿猪。两天两夜几个司机轮流开车没有停过，22日一早开到上海，分送到5个区一线抗疫单位，一直忙到第二天凌晨。“我给他们打电话，和他们说谢谢，捐了几十万的东西，连个面也没有见上。”金涛说，人住上海的徐凯，因为协调猪的事情出了小区，办完手续后却无法再回，只能先车上住了两天，后来帮他找了一个酒店住下。各区慈善基金会的票据可以用来抵扣税，但徐凯丝毫不在乎，他只是想要做点力所能及的事情帮助上海。    本报记者  屠瑜,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/5.htm,5/17/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
,建良言  献良策  画好战“疫”同心圆,,    纳言    “我们打赢了武汉保卫战，也一定能够打赢大上海保卫战。”习近平总书记在中央政治局常委会会议上的重要讲话，为打赢大上海保卫战提供了行动指南、注入了强大力量。全市上下始终坚定信心、同向而行，共克时艰、同心抗疫，凝聚起“上下同欲者胜、同舟共济者成”的强大合力。    微光点点，人人都是战斗员。我们的这场战“疫”是一场人民战争，只有人人响应、人人参与、人人自律，才能夺取最终胜利。很多市民群众向“疫”而行，当好发现问题的监督者、服务奉献的志愿者、守望相助的互助者，积极为上海疫情防控工作建良言、献良策。他是一位年轻的95后基层干部，四个多月没回过家，从机场志愿者无缝衔接下沉街道，把身边群众的所思所盼化为提出建议的真知灼见。他是一位外企员工，主动报名成为社区志愿者，在热心服务群众的同时，细心观察、认真思考，为做好基层防疫工作建言献策。她是一位白了头发的花甲老人，虽然手机运用并不熟练，但始终关注着老年人的需求，主动为老年群体发声。他们是一群热心的建议人，有一分热，发一分光，“微光点点”亦印证了同舟共济、众志成城的战“疫”力量。    聚而成炬，带头当好贴心人。全市各级人民建议征集干部坚守在听民情、解民忧、集民智的主战场，紧紧围绕防控目标任务，时刻关注群众急难愁盼，努力把群众“想法”变“办法”。他们当好倾听者，通过电话架起“调研热线”，认真沟通、耐心疏导，“将心比心”回应群众的信任与期盼。他们做好调研员，与相关部门、社区基层深入沟通、分析原因、研商对策，把民智民慧转化为战“疫”金点子。他们搭好直通车，一条条人民建议走进决策视野，转化为工作举措，共同筑牢群防群治防线，为疫情防控工作凝聚起群众的智慧和力量。    大上海保卫战没有旁观者，每一位市民都是身处其中的战士，都有自己的一份责任。我们坚信在党中央的坚强领导下，在市委、市政府的科学指挥下，在全国人民大力支持和上海人民共同努力下，只要我们勠力同心，大上海保卫战，一定能赢，一定会赢！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/6.htm,5/17/22,第6版:上海人民建议征集专刊,,False
,同舟共济  同向而行,,    本轮疫情暴发以来，人民建议征集成为聆听群众心声、汇集群众智慧、助力抗疫工作的重要平台。有这样一群人，或许身份不同、岗位不同、环境不同，但都在为这座城市早日恢复如常，观察着、思考着、行动着，他们有一个共同的名字：建议人。以下是他们的自述——    出力献计  志愿者分类防护指南及时发布    薛亚利  我是一名科研工作者，在疫情防控中，力所能及的参与是我理所当然的担当。    3月16日，我所在的小区实行“2+12”严格社区健康管理，社区工作人手急缺。19日，小区微信群里出现了“志愿者群”，我和丈夫立即扫码加入。20日，志愿者上班第一天，风大雨大，工作棚围挡被吹鼓得起来。我看到部分志愿者防护装备不全，缺衣少帽；雨水打湿了眼镜，他们会脱镜擦拭；传递物品手套磨破，有时他们也未曾替换……我很钦佩志愿者们的付出精神，但也为诸多防护隐患而担忧。志愿者是社区安全的一道门岗，如果因防护不当而感染，整个社区安全就难以保障。    我萌生念头：要为志愿者安全防护建言！我向人民建议征集信箱提交了一篇“关于尽快编制发放《社区抗疫志愿工作者分类指导手册》的建议”，提出要对志愿者进行岗前培训、分类指导、优化岗位标识、提前推出电子版手册等建议。不久后，我接到了市志愿者协会的电话，感谢我所提的建议，并介绍了他们开展的工作。紧接着，我在各类信息平台看到了大量有关志愿安全防护的知识文章、培训视频。5月初，一份“疫情防控志愿者分类防护指南”在“上海发布”等多个公众号上发布。在我们小区的志愿者工作中，我也明显感受到大家防护意识更强了，防护行为也更规范了。    作为一名社区志愿者，这次提建议的经历提醒我，学者工作不仅仅在屋中案头，还可以走向屋外门口。我想，这就是身为学者的本分和责任。    精准助力  快递小哥电子通行证上线运行    吴晞炜  我是一名民主党派成员，广泛收集民意、积极开展调研、提出合理建议，既是参政议政的重要途径，也是热爱这座城市的表达方式。    4月上旬，上海推出核酸码，将核酸检测结果与被检测人信息直接绑定，在提高核酸检测登记效率、减轻检测人员负担等方面发挥了积极作用。但是，“核酸码”截图在30日内可以反复使用这一便民点，却一定程度上增加了代检冒检的风险点。为此，我向居委干部、小区居民以及大数据领域的专家朋友进行了调研，听取他们的想法并一一记录，当晚就撰写了“关于采用多种技术手段防范核酸码代检冒检的建议”，提出要提高人员信息辨识度、强化大数据监控管理，加强对快递、外卖骑手等高风险流动人员的防疫管理。建议提交到人民建议征集信箱后，很快得到积极回应。很有幸，这则建议最终也得到了有关部门的采纳。4月下旬，配送寄递人员“电子通行证”上线了，采取多种技术手段强化信息动态监测，有效防止“带疫上岗”行为的出现。    奉献点滴力量，汇成抗疫洪流。相信我们很快就能拨云现旭日，雨后见彩虹！    退而不休  老年人疫苗接种工作逐步推进    倪晓茹  我是一名退休教师，疫情期间，除了积极配合社区做好各项防疫工作，我还有一个“热心建议人”的身份。    4月上旬，在一次疫情防控新闻发布会上，我了解到老年群体是奥密克戎变异株感染后重症、死亡的高风险人群，而他们的新冠疫苗接种率相对偏低。这组数据让我感到深深震撼。我联系了同龄朋友们，发现很多人都觉得这么大的年龄打疫苗没有必要，万一有不良反应会影响到健康；还有一种人抱着侥幸心理：认为平时很少出行，病毒找不到自己。于是，我写了一份关于“加强老年群体新冠疫苗及加强针接种”的建议，指出在当前防疫的关键时期，要一手抓防控，一手抓疫苗接种，针对老年群体，要做好宣传引导，消除其顾虑。建议提交后，得到了市人民建议征集办的重视，他们第一时间和我沟通，了解情况、完善内容，而且很快就报送相关主管部门研究。市卫健委和市疾病预防中心对我的建议非常肯定，给予积极的回应，不久，市里的新闻发布会就提出了要加强老年群体疫苗接种的工作要求。    抗疫前线需要战士，而宅家的我也能为抗疫出份力，作为建议人，甚感欣慰。    建言支招  让核酸检测采样服务为民便民    吴豪  我是一名基层干部，3月中旬，刚完成驻守浦东国际机场接运安置工作，又马不停蹄投入到村居一线的疫情防控工作。    在防疫一线，我发现随着防控形势的变化，复工企业、社区居民、城市保障运营等群体的核酸检测需求日益增大，而新增的常态化核酸采样点却存在着诸如布局不够合理、信息更新不够及时，服务外卖小哥、老年人等特殊群体便利性不足等问题。我想到，常态化核酸采样点跟每个人的生活出行密切相关，大家关心选址是否便利、采样是否安全、服务是否便捷。于是，我思考撰写了一篇“关于提升常态化核酸采样点便民度的建议”，提出一方面要做好选址调研，充分考虑上班族、驾车族、学生族、老年人等群体的不同需求，合理安排点位、服务时间等；另一方面，要考虑应急需求，比如夏季即将来临，要准备一些防暑降温物资，增设遮风挡雨设施，开通老幼孕绿色通道等，以备不时之需。    建议提出后，市征集办的同志很快就与我取得了联系，一起探讨共同研究，对建议进行了补充完善，这条建议得到了承办部门的肯定与关注。    不论是建言献策，还是参与防控，我责无旁贷。我也将继续努力，为打赢大上海保卫战贡献力量。    行走一线  为社区防疫信息发布出谋划策    乌明欣  我是一名外企员工，居家办公之余，我向社区报到，投身志愿服务，为大家出力。    在工作中我发现，由于居民不能及时获取所在社区的疫情信息，同小区、同楼栋居民容易相互猜疑，也容易引起不必要恐慌，增加社区开展工作的难度。我想，如果在居民区每天以简报、公示等方式在微信群里及时公开具体信息，如核酸、抗原检测结果的汇总、感染人员所在的具体楼栋、确诊人员的收隔转运状态等，不仅能让大家安心定心，更能增强居民配合防疫政策执行的自觉性。为更好求证，我和在其他社区服务的同事进行了交流，大家普遍觉得信息的及时公开，对居民心态的稳定和信心的凝聚至关重要。于是，结合社区实地调研和居民访谈，我向人民建议征集信箱提交了关于细化防疫信息公开、更好落实“四应四尽”工作的建议。经过与市征集办工作人员的讨论完善，建议以摘报形式转送相关部门。后来，我发现越来越多的居民区开始及时发布各自的防疫工作信息，内容、样式也越来越丰富。    如今，我又投入到了社区代配药品专项志愿行动中，奔走在街道社区，为抗疫贡献绵薄之力。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/7.htm,5/17/22,第7版:上海人民建议征集专刊,,False
,大道至简  母爱如山,——沉痛悼念秦怡老师 ,    赵静    5月9日，清晨，我打开手机看见两个未接电话，是秦怡老师的女儿斐斐姐打来的。我心里一沉，这么早就来两个电话肯定是秦怡老师出了不好的情况，立即回电斐斐姐，可一连打了十几个都是忙音。我马上给剧团严琳主任、徐文书记打电话，打不通，后又给佟瑞欣团长打电话，也不通，我的心开始慌了，难道……正猜想，佟瑞欣团长来电话了，不等我多问就直接告诉我：“秦怡老师今晨四点零八分走了！”    按理说，秦怡老师已经一百岁了，随时都会面临生死不测的绝境，可是，今天我就是接受不了这个现实。    我仰天悲号，以泪洗面，但脑海中却像过电影似的闪烁着我和秦怡老师的一幕，一幕……    一次，上海电视台“家庭演播室”的编导给我打电话，让我去做一趟节目，这个节目，我曾经被邀请做过一次，就问这次谁的，编导说：“秦怡老师的，她点名要你做她的嘉宾。”    秦怡老师和我应是两代人了，她是我的偶像。年轻时，秦怡老师的名字就流芳艺坛，不愧为二十世纪四十年代话剧界的“四大名旦”之一。1949年后，她在电影《马兰花开》中饰演青年女工马兰，扮相十分甜美。我最爱看《铁道游击队》，秦怡老师塑造的“芳林嫂”这一角色，真是家喻户晓，脍炙人口，她老人家特别爱唱“弹起我心爱的土琵琶，唱起那动人的歌谣”。之后，秦怡老师又拍了《女篮五号》《青春之歌》《海外赤子》等一系列红遍大江南北的影片，成为当年最受欢迎的电影明星，被周总理称赞为中国最美丽女性，受到毛主席的接见……这样一位前辈、著名表演艺术家，这样一位德艺双馨的资深老师，点名让我做她节目的嘉宾，我行吗？于是，对电视台的人说：“我怎么可以呢？我担当不了。”但对方回道：“这是秦怡老师定的，她既然点了你，自有她的道理，你就不要推脱了。”这一说，我心里再怎么忐忑也没法犹豫了。    到了电视台，只见满头银发的秦怡老师，精神矍铄，一亮相就赢得观众席上一片掌声和阵阵赞叹。    她是带着她的儿子“小弟”来的。我马上明白主要话题围绕着“小弟”。秦怡老师的儿子叫“小弟”，其实他已经不小了，但是五十多岁的人看上去还像个未成年的孩子。秦怡老师就开始讲她儿子发病时的种种情况，她又是怎样带着儿子。“小弟”本名金捷，他的父亲是曾经颇负盛名的影帝金焰。金捷小时候，健康又聪明，学东西也非常快。只是，因为秦怡和金焰都是电影演员，长期外出拍戏，不能时刻陪伴在孩子身边，只好让他进托儿所。在托儿所，受大孩子欺负，经常被人打破头，甚至被人用小刀划伤。他从小内向、害羞，回家不敢说，就这样憋着。秦怡老师根本想不到儿子早已患上了抑郁症。直到十七岁那年病情爆发，从抑郁症发展为精神分裂症，她才感到事情的严重。她舍不得把儿子送到精神病院，每次外出拍戏，总是把儿子带在身边，亲手照顾他的饮食起居，为的就是弥补这么多年的亏欠。    轮到我讲。我说，今天秦怡老师为什么特别叫上我？因为我们一起参加的活动特别多，中国影协和上海影协、文联，以及外地的一些公益活动，我和秦怡老师都是一起出席。秦怡老师每次出来都带着儿子，特别不容易，我就觉得她是天底下最好的母亲。“小弟”智力有问题，她并不在乎别人说什么，而总是尽心地做一个母亲该做的一切。这样的母亲，怎能不得到周边人的同情和尊敬呢！    所以，每次一有活动，我都抢先上前帮她一把，主动搀扶“小弟”。上车后，只要“小弟”能开口讲话，我就善意地找一些他能接受的话题和他聊天，好让在家辛苦操劳的秦怡老师休息休息。就这点细微的小事，秦怡老师一直记在心上。她总觉得我能理解她，与她走得最近。而从一个母亲的角度，我特别敬佩秦怡老师。后来“小弟”得了尿毒症住在瑞金医院，我知道后就去看望。秦怡老师穿着医院的蓝色护理服，戴着帽子，戴着口罩，全副武装，俨然一个老护工。儿子在做血透，她就守在病房，一会儿理理管子，一会儿掖掖被子，一会儿又给儿子喂点温开水……真是可怜天下父母心呀，看着看着，我心里说不上是什么滋味，只觉得要找个地方抹一抹眼泪。    我的母亲不在身边，我就把秦怡老师当成自己的母亲一样，作为一位老艺术家也好，老师也好，再伟大再尊敬的称呼也比不上——母亲！    对她，我帮不上多少忙，最多只是平时在一起时上前搀扶一把，一有活动上台阶下台阶总是我搀着她。每每，心里总在想，这样一位女性，得有多大毅力，多么的坚强，才走到了今天？    外人眼里，秦怡老师雍容华贵，风光无限，殊不知她骨子里一直很苦啊。你看她，一副金丝眼镜，配上她明媚的笑容，尤其眉宇间的干净气息，整个演艺圈上下几十年似乎也难找出几个。这样的女人，应该衣来伸手饭来张口时刻被人宠着，哪知，在家里她就是个普普通通的家庭妇女，能自己做的事情都是自己做，连内衣都是自己洗。看似小事，却很了不起。我一直把她当作自己生活上的楷模！    她的生活非常节俭，但做公益却很积极。记得一次搞义演，要捐款。你就看她吧，不张张扬扬地公开数钱，而是从桌下自己的提包里随手一掏，不数，说：“我就这些钱。”我说：“你就意思一下，行了。”    “不！”她把提包又拿上来，仔细看看，尔后悄悄地把所有的钱都捐了，起码也有一万元。类似这样的事情，好多。2008年，汶川地震，秦怡老师把手头仅有的二十万元现金，全部捐出。别人问她怎么生活，她说还有工资，这个月没有了，下个月还来。秦怡老师就是这样充满大爱的人，一心想着别人，却总是忘了自己。    做人，一丝不苟；演戏，也是一丝不苟。    我常和秦怡老师一起演出，一起拍戏，她留给我的印象是对待自己的工作十分敬畏。我们一起拍电视剧《母仪天下》，她都是早早地起身收拾好等着去化妆，她因身体曾经生过病，所以出门工作时经常不吃早餐，到了现场甚至连水都很少喝，她怕到时候要上厕所耽误了拍摄时间。每逢朗诵作品，她都会尽量把朗诵稿从头至尾统统背下来，她说这样就不会老低头看稿子，而与观众没有交流。如果遇上大段的台词，她总是反复地琢磨着，怎样把最美最好的形象呈现给观众。    秦怡老师常说，美貌是可以给演员加分，但真正要演好一个角色，光凭美貌，是不够的。角色都是人，先把人做好了，角色也就演真了！    她说得认真，做得也认真。    这些点点滴滴的事，对我们这些小字辈的演员真的是一种鞭策，一种激励。当我观看她在演艺生涯的极限年龄自编自演的电影《青海湖畔》时，情不自禁地泪眼婆娑。她的真诚，她的气质，她的执着，无不时时感染、激励着我。    而今，秦怡老师突然走了，永远地离开了我们，留给我的最大遗憾是因为疫情不能够见到她最后一面，送她最后一程……只能泪水长流，在心里呼喊：永别了，我母亲一样的秦怡老师！    大道至简，母爱如山！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-17/8.htm,5/17/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

"李强在奉贤检查,要求坚决杜绝侥幸松劲，开展更大压力测试",在“控得住、放得开”上下功夫,,    本报讯  市委书记李强昨天在奉贤区检查疫情防控工作时指出，要深入贯彻落实习近平总书记重要讲话和指示批示精神，毫不动摇坚持“动态清零”总方针，把降新增和防反弹牢牢抓在手上，以更加坚定果断、全面彻底的措施做到“四应四尽”，进一步巩固扩大疫情防控成果，有序有效恢复正常生产生活秩序，为打赢大上海保卫战奠定坚实基础。    李强在奉贤城区察看居民区有序有限开放和街面商铺、超市、药店等开放营业秩序，来到宝龙城市广场检查有序恢复线下经营情况。目前这里的复工商铺实行集中居住、闭环管理，店内员工每日开展抗原和核酸检测，公共区域定时进行环境消杀，并采取错峰限流、保持社交距离等措施。李强向商铺店员亲切问好，详细询问各项防疫措施执行以及复工以来线上线下订购情况，叮嘱大家继续加强个人防护不松懈，把防疫要求不折不扣落到位，真正做到对个人负责、对顾客负责，共同维护来之不易的防控成果。随后，李强来到望园路快速公交站，检查区内交通在严格落实疫情防控措施前提下逐步恢复运营情况，要求根据疫情防控形势及市民出行需求，加强分析研判，不断优化调整，确保公交出行安全有序，为恢复正常生产生活秩序提供有力支撑。市领导还就公共场所设置“场所码”“数字哨兵”助力疫情防控等听取一线感受和想法建议。    检查期间，李强听取奉贤区牢牢抓好降新增、防反弹，逐步恢复正常生产生活秩序有关工作汇报，就关心的问题与区里同志深入交流。李强指出，既要看到当前疫情形势总体稳中向好，也要清醒认识防控基础仍不稳固，还须付出艰苦努力，坚决杜绝侥幸松劲，拔点清面要加大力度，面上筛查要全面彻底，清零区域要巩固拓展。奉贤、金山、崇明等区要结合区域实际，抓住当前窗口期，积极担当作为，坚决落实“疫情要防住、经济要稳住、发展要安全”要求，开展更大程度压力测试，在“控得住、放得开”上下功夫，为全市面上积累经验、提供借鉴。要强化数字化赋能疫情防控的针对性和实效性，结合常态化核酸检测，加快推广“场所码”和“数字哨兵”，为健全完善常态化疫情防控体系提供坚强保障。    市领导诸葛宇杰参加检查。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/2.htm,5/18/22,第2版:要闻,,False
疫情下的上海新增国际货运通道,“中欧班列-上海号”回程车来了,,    日前，搭载着43个40尺集装箱、价值1000多万美元有色金属原材料的“中欧班列-上海号”从哈萨克斯坦的阿腾科里运抵上海闵行站。这是“中欧班列-上海号”（阿腾科里-上海）回程班列的首列，也是上海在疫情期间新增的一条国际货运通道。    作为全球集装箱吞吐量第一的港口城市，从今年3月下旬开始，上海的人员流动逐渐进入静止状态，但上海在国际贸易中的地位却不允许它停下来。不断不乱，稳链固链，飞驰在欧亚大陆上的“中欧班列”正是上海全力保障供应链、产业链畅通的一道缩影。    物畅其流    去年9月28日，“中欧班列-上海号”正式开行，通过发挥国际铁路联运的独特优势，成为上海稳定连接欧亚大陆、融入国内国际双循环的重要通道。今年3月底，新冠疫情席卷上海，给国际贸易带来严峻挑战。如何保障“物畅其流”？开行仅半年的“中欧班列-上海号”选择坚守。    克服疫情下的不利条件，“中欧班列-上海号”满载着变频器、收线机、交流稳压器、永磁同步无齿轮曳引机等“中国制造”一路奔驰，抵达哈萨克斯坦后，又在本月带着43个集装箱、价值千万美元的电解铜而归，满足国内机械、汽车、建筑等工业领域的原料需求。    一路畅通的背后，是线上线下、场内场外的密切配合。近两个月以来，面对疫情可能导致的运输影响，上海东方丝路多式联运有限公司作为货源组织方和平台运营公司，时刻做好铁路放行的准备，召集员工留守现场，全力保障供应链物流畅通。    东方丝路董事长王锦秋告诉记者，此次“中欧班列-上海号”（阿腾科里-上海）回程班列的顺利开通，还意味着“中欧班列-上海号”实现了中欧线、中俄线、中亚线的全覆盖，“是上海在面临疫情大考的关键时刻，为全球产业链做贡献、为国内产业链赋能的一个缩影”。    稳链固链    上海在我国的进出口业务当中扮演着重要角色，2021年，上海市进出口总值创历史新高，达4.06万亿元，其中出口1.57万亿元，进口2.49万亿元。作为世界最大的贸易口岸城市，上海不能“停摆”。    市商务委已制定《重点外贸企业复工复产工作指引（试行）》，先后发布了两批复工复产重点外贸企业“白名单”，包括货物贸易类、服务贸易类、外资总部类和口岸服务类企业共计704家，其中，第一批142家，第二批562家。第一批“白名单”中的企业已有63%复工复产，第二批“白名单”企业正在准备复工复产。第三批“白名单”820余家也将于近日发布。    围绕“人能出、车能动、货能转”的要求，“中欧班列-上海号”将积极发挥作用。王锦秋表示，在原定开行计划数上还要争取增开班列，竭尽全力保障外贸企业和产业链供给链畅通运转。    本报记者  张钰芸,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/3.htm,5/18/22,第3版:要闻,,False
瑞金医院医疗服务全面恢复,上午门诊接诊3700余人,,    5月1日以来，全市医疗机构在不放松疫情防控的前提下，逐步恢复日常医疗服务。昨天，上海首次宣布16个区实现社会面清零，记者从上海交通大学医学院附属瑞金医院获悉，医疗服务已经全面恢复，昨天、今天都有两千多名医护人员在各个岗位为病人服务。截至今天上午11时，该院上午门诊接诊3700余人，出诊专家79位。    今天上午10时，瑞金医院门诊大厅井井有条，市民在导诊台、挂号等窗口有序排队。在居民代配药服务点，不时有社区志愿者带着几十张医保卡前来咨询、挂号。为避免病人多次往返，医院放射、超声等诊断科室全面启动，目前无需预约即可当天做CT和核磁共振、超声等检查。瑞金急诊在疫情期间始终保持开放绿色通道，近日启用的急诊急救第二诊疗区特地配备了3间诊室、10间临时观察室和2间负压舱，确保各种疑难重症病人能够得到及时救治。    糖尿病患者王阿姨说，她是江苏人，但是在上海已经生活了几十年了，住在瑞金医院附近，最早发现糖尿病的时候就是在瑞金就诊的，所以二十年来一直在瑞金医院看病和验血，这里的医生护士都很亲切也很负责。昨天是她疫情期间第二次来看病，感觉还是蛮方便的，只要小区提前一天开证明就能出门到瑞金医院就诊。    瑞金医院副院长、淋巴瘤专家赵维莅说，上海宣布社会面清零，大家都很振奋。特别开心的是，一位此前从外地慕名而来的患者，之前在外院行CAR-T治疗部分缓解，上海疫情期间经过团队不懈努力终于获得了完全缓解，专程送来了感谢信。相信随着大家齐心协力，一定可以迎来大上海保卫战的胜利。    肝脏外科主任陈拥军说，昨天上午看门诊时发现，已经有外地病人赶来看病了，上午收了三个外省市赶来瑞金的肝脏肿瘤病人，都是需要尽早手术治疗的。“感觉上海疫情确实在明显好转，我们本来一直有点担心病人因为通勤关系不方便来医院，现在总算放心了！”    瑞金医院自本轮疫情以来，始终坚持开放门急诊、发热门诊和住院收治服务，并根据实际情况不断调整方案，在加强分区和楼宇管理的防控基础上，提出设置缓冲病房等防疫措施，保障了病人安全。据介绍，医院手术室昨天共完成72台手术。“上海社会面清零，医务人员工作重心也将逐渐从抗疫战场回归基本医疗，满足人民医疗服务需求，全力做好人民健康保障。”瑞金医院副院长、胰腺中心主任沈柏用说。本报记者  左妍  通讯员  朱凡,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/4.htm,5/18/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,安徽爸爸临终前盼返乡  一夜无眠护送千里回家,,    本报记者  钱俊毅  王军  房浩    今天6时32分，在经历8小时47分钟“生死时速”后，安徽爸爸被安全转运到了千里之外的六安市霍邱县，“临终前想回家看看”的愿望实现了！昨夜，“安徽爸爸临终前盼叶落归根  千里转运紧急开启”慢直播上线，137.6万网友云上守护、一路相伴，全网评论总数16896条，新华社也拉流直播。    在前天的新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，从安徽六安市霍邱县来沪的李俊超向“新民帮侬忙”发来求助，4月30日，他的爸爸在复旦大学附属中山医院肿瘤科被确诊为肠癌，目前已转移扩散到肝脏和胰腺。生命最后时刻，爸爸唯一念头就是叶落归根，回到老家。讲着讲着，电话那头，24岁小伙忍不住伤心哭泣：“我爸爸16天没吃没喝了，就靠着吊营养液维持生命。每次他病痛发作的时候，就紧紧拽着我说：“咱们回家吧！可我实在没办法啊……”    李俊超告诉记者，3岁的时候，母亲就抛下他们父子，20多年一直是爸爸靠着辛苦打工的微薄收入，撑起整个家。“爸爸不舍得吃不舍得用，再苦再累都自己熬着。没想到，我现在有能力孝顺他了，但爸爸却要离开我了……”子欲孝而亲不在，话至伤心处，李先生又是几度哽咽。    疫情封控、交通管制，面对爸爸最后的愿望，600多公里的路，几乎成了无法跨越的“鸿沟”。在看到“广西病危爸爸1700公里转运”的全网直播后，李先生的心里又燃起希望，向“战疫·帮侬忙”发出求助。    现场连线刚一结束，上海裕皖实业总经理徐士超立刻打来电话：“还是我们送！”昨天，“紧急转运”模式再次开启：中山医院不仅立刻制定病人回去后集中隔离期间的药物治疗方案，而且还特地送来几套防护服；来自“裕皖实业”的“护送三人组”郑洲、王磊、高锋迅速做了核酸检测，备好牛奶、酸奶、面包、八宝粥等，为车辆加满油，整装待发；浦东新区唐镇有关部门经多方协调，开具了离沪通行证和返沪通行证。    昨天21时，别克商务车从浦东新区唐陆公路出发，45分钟后，到达徐汇区的中山医院。    21时45分，600多公里紧急转运，开启了！    5月17日21时55分    中山医院附近    紧急调整“救命管”    坐上车后，儿子李俊超长舒一口气，十多天来，因为照顾爸爸，他累得筋疲力尽，最近看着爸爸天天痛苦不堪，更是心如刀割。    车子刚开出10分钟，安徽爸爸突然用手按住腹部，脸也微微涨红，儿子马上就察觉出异样：“可能是爸爸腹部的导流管松动，扯到伤口了，我得调整下！”    一听这话，车子迅速靠边。李俊超弯下腰，轻轻将爸爸身上的导流管调回原位，“爸爸5月初刚做了手术，这根导流管是用来排黄疸的。”安置妥当后，再次启程，“护送三人组”不停相互关照着：“叔叔身体不好，我们尽量开慢点！”22时40分，车子通过京沪高速江桥收费站，驶上离沪高速。    5月17日23时05分    江苏阳澄湖服务区旁    暖男司机回忆亡母    昨天23时05分，行驶83公里后，商务车停在了京沪高速阳澄湖服务区旁，稍作休整。李爸爸仰坐在座椅上，慢慢睁开眼睛。“叔叔，累了吗？要开得再慢点吗？”大家关切地询问。对此，他轻轻摆了摆手：“回家了，心里特别激动。不会累的……”    面对直播镜头，郑洲的眼中似乎有泪光闪动。他说，自己的家乡在寿县，和霍邱县仅一河之隔。“3年前，我一直在这条路上奔波，陪着患癌症的妈妈看病。5月19日正是我妈妈3周年的忌日，真的好想回去拜祭她……”话到此处，郑洲一时语塞，对于安徽爸爸落叶归根的心愿，他最能读懂。    “先是广西爸爸，往返3500公里；又是安徽爸爸，护送千里之外。郑洲，你是最暖男”。当副驾驶座上的高锋读出评论区网友的话时，郑洲立刻回复道：“只要能帮到别人，只要是做正能量的事，每个人都会义不容辞。这一夜、这一路守护我们的网友，都是最暖最暖的！”    5月18日4时许    安徽全椒服务区    网友一路导航伴行    1时34分，护送专车抵达京沪高速南京收费站。此时，路边有指示牌出现：绕行车辆从四桥（栖霞山大桥）方向行走，导航栖霞山服务区，到达后再导航目的地。按图索骥，车辆两下高速公路，调头重上后，于2时33分停在六合收费站，根据检查人员指示，会有车辆引导前往沪陕高速。    2时42分，打着双闪的引导车驶来，回家的路继续启程。2时55分在到达龙池服务区加油后，护送车经江北大道快速路，于3时13分驶入沪陕高速。此时评论区里，“人肉”导航模式快速开启——“一定要走沪陕，别走宁洛，回霍邱的话”“还有30公里，就到安徽全椒服务区了”“还有几公里，就可以看到‘安徽欢迎您’的牌子了”……    3时36分，车辆终于驶入安徽境内。4时许，在安徽全椒服务区旁停靠时，安徽爸爸的兴奋之情溢于言表，“离家越来越近了……”    “回家的夜路并不漆黑，因为有爱照亮前方！”——这一刻，有网友在评论区留下这样的话。    5月18日6时32分    安徽马店收费站    送到了饭才吃得香    6时32分，济广高速马店收费站，1辆120救护转运车、8位“大白”已早早守候在了道口，众人搀扶着安徽爸爸下了车，坐上了轮椅。“回来了，回来了！”紧紧握着儿子的手，爸爸语音颤抖。不远处，李俊超的姑姑赶来送早饭了，当看到哥哥和侄子时，喜极而泣。在经过核酸检测和抗原自测后，父子俩随即被闭环转运至当地隔离医院。    这时，郑洲、王磊、高锋正式开启“吃播模式”：灌汤小笼、胡辣汤、肉夹馍……一个个狼吞虎咽。忙了一夜，真是累了；赶了这一路，真是饿了。“人送到了，这饭吃得香，这饭吃得踏实！”“护送三人组”一边不停往嘴里塞着包子，一边对着镜头如是说。    “上车，回上海！”20分钟后，三人钻进了车厢。车子启动，当记者问起此行的感受时，郑洲、王磊、高锋几乎异口同声地说：“疫情无情人有情！只要有爱，就没有过不去的坎！”此时，郑洲还禁不住唱起了歌，“只要人人都献出一份爱，世界将变成美好的人间……”,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/5.htm,5/18/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,紫藤架下读书郎,,    裘索    植物中，无拘无束攀缘的藤本植物是我喜欢的，色彩中，高贵静雅的紫色是我钟爱的，儿子的成长过程中，紫藤架下读书的光景是我怀恋的。    我曾远足去了世界最为知名的位于日本栃木县的足利紫藤园，感受过四棵150岁高龄的紫藤老树花开时满天紫色的震撼，但我还是更偏爱东京的第一赏藤地龟户天神社，在植物中植入了更多的人文。记得最近一次去是在儿子高中考大学那一年，因为龟户天神社与天满宫神社一样都是祭祀学问的神社、是学子祈求金榜题名的灵验之地。然而最喜欢而又不能取代的是家园里的紫藤。    上世纪的最后一年，怀揣襁褓中的爱儿从东京回到故乡上海。寻寻觅觅，最终择定一庭院深深、有着好看的浅紫色外墙的住宅而居。坐北朝南的寒舍东墙，从南到北架以有年轮的紫藤长廊，腕臂粗的树干遒劲地扭靠在挺直的木架上，枯槁的根茎、皴裂的躯干，似干竭却姿态古朴妩媚，藤条缠缠绕绕。    年复一年，年年藤花紫。    初春，新发的枝条青翠浅绿，紫藤花架上浓浅不一紫藤沿着设定的路径，寻着太阳的光照神乎其神地绵延爬长着，嫩绿的纤叶一天天不停地覆盖着藤架上的天空。到了春天，靠着墙的紫藤树干上的枝蔓还顺着藤架爬上了的墙角，竟然探着头调皮地将藤尖挤进二楼的卧室，让我好生欢喜。庭院深深廊道长，长长的藤蔓被牵引到很远很远的前方，紫藤架下，翻动着看图说文童话书的小小读书郎一定在梦幻的世界里被牵引得很远很远了。    岁月之美，美在它的静好，也美在它的流逝，在流逝的岁月里又有多少人是我们心中盛开的紫藤花，值得我们停下脚步去怀恋。    庭院深深藤道长，无论是悲是喜，是哀是乐，抑或无所事事，在紫藤长廊下走走成了习惯。暮春的繁花、盛夏的绿荫、晚秋的落叶、冬日的残枝，紫藤长廊的四时风光恰似一帘幽梦，每一季的每一帘都上我心，而最上心头的那一帘当是暮春，紫中透蓝的紫藤花映衬在浅紫色的屋墙上、脉脉相承融入其中，蒸融在紫气东来的烟霞里……千里风香春几许，庭前十丈紫藤花。紫藤最美的瞬间莫过于紫光一庭、穆穆闲闲中随风摇曳的模样，于我则是在这最美瞬间醉美于紫藤花架下长椅上捧着小儿画册朗朗而读的小小读书郎。    庭院里的紫藤花越开越繁，紫藤叶越长越盛，蜂蝶鸟也越来越多。一年又一年，紫色花穗的花舱里裹藏着的生命琼浆也越来越丰醇，随着紫藤树年轮的次第上旋，儿子也渐渐长大，像小鸟一样飞出了庭院，时而又飞回家门。回忆像老旧温暖的相片，又像模糊而又温黄的书卷，紫色花瓣打底的背景让过往的岁月带着诗意。    一日，小学二年级的读书郎从学校捧回了在陶艺课上制作的陶罐，拉着我要我去看看他的手工作品，陶罐正面的一团倒挂的等腰狭长的紫中透蓝釉色映入眼前。    “阿宝，这是啥东东呀？”    “姆妈，侬猜猜看呀，就是侬欢喜额……”    “姆妈伐晓得呀，猜勿出呀。”    儿子暗示我：“是阿拉青溪园里额……”    我不解地摇了摇头。    他又提醒我说：“上趟，阿拉还拿伊放到米粉糊里再捞出来，放到油锅里做过花瓣天妇罗的……”    “哦哦，是阿拉院子里紫藤架下的紫藤花。”我大声地喊了出来。    暮春，又见紫藤花开。花瓣绽放，蓝紫喷涌，时间也被打开。那青溪庭院紫藤花架下的读书郎充盈着我的心脑。眼前的紫藤瀑布如锚一般固定下的画面，铆住了易逝春光。时间的云层里，意识的蓝天下，由浅而深的花垂下，丝丝紫意在蔓延，那份蔓延似手拳的渐次松开，让紫藤花开的沉甸去牢牢握住童心。    春风吹过，满架紫藤，一院清香，景色依旧，只是紫藤架下少了小小的读书郎。    儿子的那个手工陶罐成了我的珍藏，我把它放在我的书房里，腾出书架上足够的空间，让它稳稳妥妥地放着，让正面的那一片紫釉正对着案桌前坐着的我，无论春夏秋冬，只要抬头就能见紫。    秋冬风紧，叶片飘落，留下苍劲的干枝和虬曲的枝条，我徘徊在孤清的紫藤长廊，想起川端康成说，这紫藤花最懂多愁善感。    紫藤的花语不就是依依的思念吗！紫藤花开暮春，暮春时节总是带有些许的伤感和怀念。鲁迅唯一的一部爱情小说《伤逝》，深切的期待与窗外的紫藤糅合在一起，有着朦胧的美好，紫藤花开满的院落，子君与涓生在一起的美好，成为涓生对子君永远的怀念。    开满紫藤花的院落，却不见紫藤花架下读书郎。    惆怅春归留不得，紫藤花下渐黄昏。    “紫藤里有风。”我站在紫藤架下，想起了汪曾祺说的这句话。紫藤里的风，从旧年往事中吹来。紫藤花开细碎，还有那缠绕的藤萝，不就是心中不能放下的怀恋。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/6.htm,5/18/22,第6版:夜光杯,,False
,“我不为他做，谁为他做？”,——怀念李蔷华奶奶,    王悦阳    连绵阴雨之中，一代京剧大家李蔷华奶奶以93岁高龄辞世，至此，作为“程派五老”之一的第二代京剧“程派”艺术传承人，悉数谢幕，令人为之哀婉伤心。    作为京剧表演艺术家与国家级非遗传承人，蔷华奶奶一生可谓功成名就，华彩斐然，在其一系列代表作《锁麟囊》《二堂舍子》《春闺梦》《亡蜀鉴》中，观众得以感受其受一代宗师程砚秋先生的深刻影响，可谓得其真传。在继承“程派”艺术上，蔷华奶奶用心专注、十分严谨，特别是在学习“程派”唱腔延绵不绝、内柔外刚的艺术特点上，非常注重原汁原味，注重声音浑厚与婉转用腔的协调，程味十足，得到业内行家的高度认同。    除了唱腔，“程派”艺术表演对圆场水袖功夫要求甚高，蔷华奶奶展现得也十分精彩到位。应该说，在她身上展现的京剧“程派”艺术，最大的特点及优点是规矩、规范、传统，学程70余年，蔷华奶奶始终强调：“我从不敢乱改程砚秋的艺术，哪怕一点一滴，因为我没有那个能力和水平。”因此，她的舞台演出，总是规矩而严谨，处处见功夫，给人美的享受。    除了艺术上的出类拔萃，蔷华奶奶更是生活中的一位好母亲，好妻子。在她晚年，另一个引人瞩目的身份是一代宗师俞振飞先生的妻子。    众所周知，她对俞振飞先生有很深的感情。她曾和我说过，那时有心人撮合晚年单身的他俩走在一起，俞老对此颇为期待，但碍于两人都是梨园行名人，第一次见面安排在广州。刚一见面，俞老腼腆地剥开一颗糖递过去，笑吟吟地对蔷华奶奶说：“这事要是成了，委屈你了。”欢喜之情溢于言表，眉梢眼角展现的幸福感，真像个热恋期的少年。蔷华奶奶则报之嫣然一笑，轻轻接过了俞老递过来的那颗糖……    就这样，两位艺术家在晚年走进了彼此的生活，恩恩爱爱。她曾坦诚地告诉我，一开始，自己对俞老的感情是同情多过爱，想着这样一位德高望重的大艺术家晚年孤苦伶仃，无人照顾，心里不忍，于是愿意放下自己本来在武汉享受的一切荣誉、地位与待遇，甚至牺牲了自己的艺术生涯，心甘情愿地来到上海，做起了俞老夫人，在生活中照顾老人。没想到相处久了，两人之间的感情越来越好，谁也离不开谁了。    而俞老晚年，也多亏了蔷华奶奶的照顾、关心与呵护，事无巨细，亲力亲为。俞老生命的最后几年卧病在床，蔷华奶奶更是无微不至地呵护着老人，茶水不能烫，吃鸡只喝汤，俞老在病床上犯了“戏瘾”，一晚上哼曲子影响了其他病友休息，蔷华奶奶第二天来探望时轻轻抚摸俞老的脸庞，笑着对他说:“想唱戏了，等我来，唱给我听，好吗？”望着爱妻，俞老露出了笑容。    有一回，蔷华奶奶生病住院了，俞老执意要去医院探望爱妻，还为蔷华奶奶亲手削了一个苹果……这样的故事很多很多，两位老人相濡以沫。而对这些往事，蔷华奶奶只有一句话：“俞老是那么了不起的艺术家，这些事，我不为他做，谁为他做？”    俞老去世后，蔷华奶奶把家中一大批珍贵资料全部捐献给了上海图书馆，建立了一套完整的俞振飞艺术档案，功莫大焉。之后，但凡有关俞老的纪念活动，总能看到她忙碌的身影，特别对于俞老最关心的上海昆剧团，蔷华奶奶更是呵护备至。2019年，在上昆成立四十周年的庆祝晚会上，当老团长蔡正仁推着耄耋之年的师娘李蔷华出现在上海大剧院的舞台，背景上俞老的巨幅照片笑意盈盈，这画面，令在场人动容不已！    有一年，因为《粉墨人生妆泪尽》一书的某些不当言论，致使俞老名誉受损，蔷华奶奶义愤填膺，第一个站出来，与蔡正仁、岳美缇等学生们一起，拿起法律武器为俞老维护名誉。官司打赢了，她还是那句话：“不能因为俞老没有子女，就随意抹黑这样一位艺术大师。我是他的妻子，这事情，我不做，谁来做？”    11年前，俞老109岁冥寿演出，她与蔡正仁老师合演《春闺梦》，允为绝唱。当年，在《春闺梦》里，程砚秋饰演张氏，俞振飞饰演王恢，两位艺术大师旗鼓相当，珠联璧合。这回由李蔷华、蔡正仁演来，仍可见程、俞遗风。    然而，那年她已是83岁的老人，自己都不免疑惑：这长达一小时的《春闺梦》，唱腔、身段繁难，还扛得下来吗？演出那天，只见她扮演的张氏一上场，快步走出，两三步后转身亮相，底下立即响起掌声，人们惊叹：李蔷华精气神犹在。其声高，如霜天鹤唳；其声幽，如空谷泉鸣，高低徐疾，操控自如，更难得的是，对于水袖、动作甚至表情，蔷华奶奶演来都一丝不苟，耄耋之年表现新婚夫妻久别重逢的欣慰喜悦，依旧那般小儿女情态，令人叫绝。我抓拍到一张甩水袖的照片，蔷华奶奶很是喜欢，专门要我放大了送她，放在家中。    台上的神完气足令人赞叹。然而，一到后台，蔷华奶奶却忍不住呕吐了，趴在桌上，久久缓不过来。整整40分钟后，蔷华奶奶缓缓抬起头，笑着对我们说：“我活过来了。”说这话时，微笑挂在嘴边，她庆幸，自己终于以一出她和俞振飞曾经合作过的《春闺梦》，完成了对俞老最好的纪念……事后，我曾问她，那么大岁数，彩唱全出，值得吗？她还是那句话：“这是我应该做的。我不为他做，谁为他做？”    今年是俞老120岁诞辰，蔷华奶奶以93岁高龄仙逝，那段晚晴岁月的美好与神仙眷侣般的传奇，也就随之而去了……愿她一路走好！我们会永远怀念她的美丽、温婉、坚强，以及那“出程入化”、高标独具的艺术！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-18/7.htm,5/18/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False

,绘出战疫志愿红,,    近日，一组每天持续更新的水墨抗疫故事漫画，在长宁区威宁小区的志愿者微信群热传。署名为“贝鹅”的创作者在参加社区志愿者工作的间隙，用笔和墨记录下所见所闻。今天上午，记者采访了这位创作者，听她讲述创作背后的故事。    “贝鹅”名叫马龙娇，34岁，是一名教育机构的设计师，平时有每周外出画画的习惯。小区封控后，她报名加入了志愿者队伍，参与小区核酸检测、物资派送等志愿者工作，帮助团队优化流程，做PPT、流程图和海报。    “画画是从5月1日开始的，那时大家都有点疲倦了，还会碰到一些不听劝的居民，会发生一些不太开心的事情。”刚开始她只是想用幽默的手法把这些事画下来，让志愿者们开心。画着画着，就想反正都画了，为何不画志愿者呢。于是，她就开始画，先画志愿者群体，再画个人，反响很好。    她说，刚开始看到网上一些画“大白”的作品，还没有一个情感的关联，因为不认识这些人，只能把他们当作一个符号，虽然这些“大白”确实伟大。但当她穿上防护服成为志愿者，和大家一起为着同一个目标努力，心情完全不一样。“我首先希望他们都能安全，一定要先保护好自己。”    “因为自己亲身经历，印象才最深，我画的都尽可能保证是自己亲眼所见，至少画的都是认识的人。希望用我的画去记录我看到的这些积极能量吧。”她印象最深的一幅画是关于志愿者搬运物资的场景（见左图）。4月16日傍晚，威宁小区拿到了百珍堂捐赠的物资，目测有30米左右长的卡车，她和大家一起把物资从卡车上搬下来，都累趴了。但能够帮助到1912户居民，感到非常值得。    到今天，马龙娇已经画了58张。她用手绘漫画的形式，记录了战疫中那抹志愿红，也画出了社区居民“同心抗疫”的心声。她说，她还要继续画下去，画全小区所有志愿者。    本报记者  屠瑜,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/4.htm,5/19/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,离开与留下,,    范洁    昨晚，同事拍摄的一段视频走红网络：在上海虹桥火车站，市民刘先生连续多天自掏腰包，买了四五十份盒饭，专程送给站外候车的旅客，他说：“希望他们最后在回家之前，能够吃上这顿晚饭。”    这些天，上海对外交通逐步恢复，关于离沪的问询与讨论，也明显多了起来。朋友圈，有滞留上海急着返校备考的初三学生，有想带早产宝宝回老家护理的妈妈，也有因为疫情已经延期入职的打工人。网络上，返乡攻略、交通指南、候车视频等，催热了“离开上海”的话题。    去与留，在这座曾经人来人往的都市，很少如此受到关注。事实上，按下暂停键近两个月，离沪的需求积累、疑问集中也在情理之中，及时答疑解惑就好。与之相比，在关于离沪的讨论中，更让人难忘的，是那些“我会留在上海”的声音和理由。    留下，有“等一等”的坚持，如今的成果来之不易，需要共同守护。因为疫情，从事影视工作的小泽收入锐减，面对亲人催促回家，他回复“不添乱，再等等”。城市正在复苏，背后是每个人的不懈努力与支持配合，目前疫情防控仍处在拔点攻坚的关键时期，“防外溢”“非必要不离沪”是打赢“大上海保卫战”的重要一环。    留下，有“门对门”的温情，人际的纽带刷新重塑，形成更多连结。三年前，宁小姐来沪创业，上海在她眼里，是繁华的商圈，是璀璨的霓虹，是快捷的交通，这场疫情让她的记忆点从“物”转为“人”，如今的上海，是送菜的邻居，是减租的房东，是万能的团长，是辛劳的志愿者，那些凡人微光，成为她与这座城市更深的连结。    留下，有“日复日”的热爱，熟悉的上海终将回来，爱她的人愿意为之努力。昨天，同事采访了三位深夜值守的“大白”姑娘，她们已经不计报酬、风餐露宿一个半月。当被问及疫情之后会否离开上海，她们坦言“不会离开，我觉得这座城市发展潜力很大”，相信“困难只是暂时的，一切都会好的”，因为“我们对上海的热情不是一天两天，我依旧会爱上海”。    其实，更多留下的人，并不会说“为什么”，而是像为离沪旅客送上盒饭的刘先生，默默行动与付出，正是这份坚韧、互助、文明、守序，构筑起这座城市的精神品格。    人生忽如寄。重要的是，无论去与留，每个人都曾与上海一起共渡难关。留下的人，让我们继续拼搏，一起去守护、去迎接、去创造我们热爱的那个上海。今天离开的人，我们也期待，在这里与你再次相逢。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/5.htm,5/19/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
化疗药配送需全程冷链  湖州“药神妈妈”发愁送药难,返沪途中“车神”改道  6名白血病患儿有救了,,    5月16日20时许，闵行区万源路400弄望族新苑，当五位白血病娃母亲从“药神妈妈”许女士手中接过化疗药“门冬”时，一个个喜极而泣、泪流满面，“有救了！孩子有救了！”而此刻，刚护送病危广西爸爸回柳州、往返3500多公里的“转运车神”郑洲和汪纯，站在离她们不远处的小区门外。（详见本报5月15日6版《1700公里风雨兼程  广西爸爸昨出发回家》、16日6版《生命最后时刻只想陪儿子中考  癌症晚期的广西爸爸回家了》）    药难送  患儿母亲发愁    5月14日，当浙江湖州的许女士看着家中需要全程冷链配送的“救命药”时，一筹莫展、无能为力。于是，她向“新民帮侬忙”发来“十万火急”的求助信息。在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，许女士说话的声音沙哑急促：“儿子患有急性髓系列白血病，现在上海治疗，‘救命药’真的不能停。但疫情期间，这个药在全上海都暂时断货，没有了它，孩子幼小的生命随时都可能被病魔夺去！”而与许女士遭遇同样困境的还有5名母亲，目前这些患儿都在上海，其中最小的只有2岁。    在开启全国“紧急搜索”模式后，被患儿家属称为“药神妈妈”的许女士从广州为6名白血病娃求来了“救命药”，由于种种原因，只能先全程冷链配送到她在湖州的家中。随后，如何将这批药送达上海的“最后150公里”成了难题。许女士曾想过绕道南京坐高铁抵沪，但票能不能抢到？虹桥火车站有没有运力能送到小区？这其中只要有一处脱节，好不容易得来的“救命药”就全毁了。直播中，新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”记者当即表示，许女士只要一抵达虹桥火车站，“战疫·帮侬忙”一定落实最后一棒17公里的运送。    我来办  两“车神”再接单    随后，许女士在网上看到了“穿越1700公里转运广西爸爸”的直播，又给记者打来电话，能不能请两位“转运车神”在回沪途中，经过一下湖州，这种“点对点”的直达方式应该更加安全、更加靠谱。    “孩子的事，性命交关！”记者在细致询问相关疫情防控措施后，5月15日6时许，当上海裕皖实业有限公司的郑洲、汪纯刚驾车驶上返沪之路时，给他们发去了求助信息。3分钟后，手机铃声响起，回答干脆利落：“这事就交给我们了！”别克商务车立即从湖南绕道湖北，直奔浙江湖州。    5月16日18时，沪昆高速湖州段，“药神妈妈”和“转运车神”接上了头。抱着一大盒20分钟前刚从冰箱取出就被棉被裹得严严实实的“救命药”，许女士上了车。2小时后，运送车驶达复旦大学附属儿科医院，在“药神妈妈”做完核酸检测并确定第二天能陪儿子到院化疗后，车子又赶到了医院附近许女士和另五位宝妈的暂住地。此时，居委会书记等早已等在小区门口，抗原自测确认阴性后，宝妈们“会合”了。眼见着“救命药”被分送到一双双迫不及待伸出的双手里时，郑洲和汪纯这才放心驾车离去。    回到上海的居所，紧紧抱着儿子，“药神妈妈”拨通了记者的电话：“孩子的病一定会好的，到时，我一定要带着他去感谢每一个帮助我们的人！”本报记者  王军  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月16日11时至5月19日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求723件，其中紧急类诉求289件，已推动解决231件（含“公益联盟”112件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道，给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/6.htm,5/19/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,更新与重启,,    张欣    最近看到一个视频很受启发，说有一点年龄和成绩的人更容易自我闭塞，就是只要不附和自己价值观或者超出自己认知范围的任何事情，一律不接受或者断言是错误的。    可是这是一个更新观念的年代，除了对于许多朴素真理和常识必须坚持之外，如果不加思考地对所有问题闭塞处理，也是很难进步的。    其实人的一生都可以成长和进步，这就要求我们有一个开放的心态。    我是一个观念比较陈旧的人，比如扬长避短这个词我是很赞同的，因为十个指头有长短，做自己所擅长的事这个道理非常正确。    可是我就是有一个朋友（不说名字了有蹭热度的嫌疑），她的特点就是不惧怕短板，有些“越是艰险越向前”的味道。举个例子：她是文字工作者，当众表达是弱项，既没有当过领导也没有做过教师，要吃开口饭并非易事。    我们一开始做活动时，她的发言都有些条理不清，表达也没有她的文章那样层次分明。    这肯定是明显的短板，如果是我就会选择避坑。但是她就是选择多讲，多锻炼自己，不断地修正和重启。结果她现在讲得非常好。    最近跟她一起做活动，她发言的主题鲜明，观点清晰，张弛有度，精简节制。    所以说把扬长避短改为自我挑战也不是不可以，如果对自己的劣势只是认怂，一味地回避，那么当然它就永远是我们的短板。    还有一个例子就是关于自信的界定。    比方说，“求人不如求己”也是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理，但是现今社会强调的是“让专业的人做专业的事”。事实也充分证明了不是靠一己的雄心壮志便可以解决所有问题。    一个领域里的成功者在另一个领域可能很平庸，这都很正常，因为社会分工越发细化，全才真的是少之又少。    所以，我一听说地产商要做电动车，就感觉他哪来的底气。    而万事不想求人的我们，如果对于自己不懂的行业，虚心请教专业人士，尊重他们的意见和专业是不是一件很棒的事，不仅不会事倍功半，同时对方也会认可你是一个明白人。    把机会留给可能发挥得更好的人，或者年轻人，也是善举。    这是不是观念的更新和重启呢。    所以还是要终身学习，永不闭塞。    这不是观念的转变，而是一种人生态度。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/7.htm,5/19/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,走江湾,,    张怡微    最近怀念起三月时常去散步的虹口江湾。    沿纪念路穿过车站南路，会遇到一个驾驶员培训场，一直走到底，就是凉城，那是一个市民味道很重的热闹地方。没有疫情的时候，夜夜有广场舞的人群，远远就能听到音乐声。广场舞落幕后，约十一点光景，会看到很多遛狗的年轻人，夜晚是他们的。这一路很寂寥，即使不是疫情，夜晚也是空的。能见到好看的复兴高级中学，这是一所老中学了，学校前身是“麦瑟尼克”学校，始建于1886年，1915年迁入定名为“汤姆·汉壁礼男童公学”。    有时我会在水电路转弯，穿过车站北路奎照路，就会抵达即将拆迁的万安路，亦是另一种风貌。沿路可能有四到五家红烧牛肉面的铺子，映照周围也许有不少喜欢吃面的人。也有不到一平方米的小商铺，夜里还在卖买二送一的葱油饼，12元两篮的草莓，可见老江湾坐拥水网，买卖兴隆，至今依然看得到古朴的市声。    万安路是这两年才有点认识。教课带着复旦创意写作的研究生采风走过多次，去年和媒体合作“上海在地写作计划”，又走一遍，刚好赶上了万安路旧改动迁，当时有爷叔阿姨主动跑出来带我们学生导览，说起三观堂历史直接从清朝开始讲起，完全不认生，也不在乎下雨，不在乎时间。我拍了点视频，没想到时隔半年，人去楼空。现在万安路几乎已经搬空。我认识它的时候，它就已经要消失了。    三观堂本来是个道教活动场所，两百多年后又改为佛教寺庙，香火不旺，但经历风霜。上海解放初，在江湾镇共有三处道观寺庙，万安路一线，在三观堂东面，即现逸仙路东侧原有东王（岳）庙；在万安路西面，即现江杨南路处原有牛郎庙。我们采访到一位老镇长叫倪卫民，他说自己在东王庙里上的小学，每天上学从大殿进去，右边是阎王爷，左边是关公。“三月廿八轧江湾”时，当地小学生可以放假三天，市里的学生则不放假，所以他从3月1日就开始期盼。现在东王庙与牛郎庙都没有了，只剩下三观堂静静地留在原地。有趣的是，对面社区人家的空调护栏，都是镂出三观堂简笔画造型的花纹。不知是社区规划的，还是三观堂赞助的。三月初，生鲜电商告急，春生街、魁星阁附近的水果店、粮油店、菜店倒是供货充足的，可以买到便宜的鸡蛋、竹笋和草莓。理发店多达六七家，店员比顾客多得多。每次路过龙腾小区附近，我都会停一停。因为曾有人说，抗战时期那里有一个慰安所。二十年前，曾有一位韩国女士来到这里寻找，但是没有找到遗迹。上海师范大学中国“慰安妇”研究中心的老师，曾在2015年公布一批江湾镇慰安所的照片，后来收录在《证据：上海172个慰安所揭秘》一书中，想到这些照片，沿路的沧桑便加深了许多。    再折回铁路，穿过逸仙路，可看到高架下的花，有勃勃生机。从学府街一直走到住过3年的复旦北区宿舍，想到时光就这样匆匆流去，当时的自己却从没有耐心和闲心如现在一般，把一条旧路走了又走，一有空就走走。    去年我还会继续往新江湾方向走，一直走到湿地。从古老走向草创，从沉重走向轻盈，空气也会越来越沁人心脾，鸟叫声会越来越清晰。虽然同样叫“江湾”，风貌则大不同。往虹口江湾走去，那是乡土又沧桑的；往江湾体育中心走去，那是全上海外观最像台北市的地方；往新江湾城走去，则是对我这样“江湾”的外人来说更容易接近的样子。我最喜欢的湿地公园中庭，每天下午都会有七八位萨克斯风乐手，同时吹奏，惊人的是，他们几乎可以同时开始、同时结束、吹的却是不一样的曲子，如果我有机会做声音民族志，我一定会在那里呆上很久很久。他们的观众，大多抱着柴犬。观鸟亭里，有设备完善、长枪短炮的叔叔们。河道边又有一群姜太公。但是我从没搞清楚观鸟亭里那么多人拍的到底是哪只鸟，也没有等到一条跃起的江湾鱼。    就这样，有时是天亮走到天黑，有时是天黑走到深夜。最终从江湾走到家，我总要给自己的膝盖贴上两块药布。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-19/8.htm,5/19/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

从复工第一天的激动、忐忑、压力大，到如今的安定、坚定、信心足,在沪外企克服难关全力以“复”,,    清晨6时多，位于青浦工业园区内的妮维雅上海制造中心陆续出现人影，工友们在进入生产区之前逐一做好抗原检测。7时，生产线准时开启，一瓶瓶护肤品被快速包装，成品随着机械手臂被举起放下，又一箱箱摆放整齐。    看着飞速旋转的流水线，中心生产总经理陈圣祥百感交集，从复工第一天的激动、忐忑、压力大，到如今的安定、坚定、信心足，背后是各级政府部门防疫、生产两手抓的毫不懈怠，也是外资企业决心守“沪”的韧性不减。    机器声响，生产线重开    工作在上海青浦，生活在江苏昆山，陈圣祥是典型的长三角跨城通勤人。但从3月21日开始，他就没有回过家。    “最初接到的通知，是浦西封控4天，因此3月31日晚上离开工厂后，我住进了酒店，等待4月5日开工，没想到一等就是22天。”他说，当时天天看新闻发布会，天天盼着早日复工，“因为妮维雅上海制造中心是拜尔斯道夫集团在华的唯一生产基地，全国的销售渠道基本都等着我们供货”。    曙光是在4月中旬来临的。拜尔斯道夫中国企业事务总经理雷开霆记得很清楚，复工申请和员工名单交上去没多久，青浦工业园区就在4月21日批准了复工。    4月22日晚，陈圣祥第一个回到厂区。来不及感慨，立刻投入到紧张的筹备工作中。“我们是先遣部队，要接收好口罩、防护服、消毒水等防疫物资，安排好食物、帐篷、被褥等生活物资，迎接次日到的员工。”    全员两次核酸，静默48小时后，厂区终于响起了机器声。如今100多位员工在厂区内实施封闭式管理，多条生产线高效运行，恢复到了同期产能的40%。    闭环生产，打通产业链    重回生产轨道的外企，不止是拜尔斯道夫。    5月13日，上海市经信委主任吴金城表示，本市已推动三批“白名单”企业3000多家复工复产，其中外资企业847家，复工率已达80%。    5月15日，上海市商务委主任顾军表示，本市已发布两批复工复产重点外贸企业“白名单”，包括货物贸易类、服务贸易类、外资总部类和口岸服务类企业共计704家。第三批名单820余家也将于近日发布。    承担着重要保供任务，博世中国在上海的两家汽车零部件工厂和一家热力技术工厂，在疫情期间均处于闭环生产之中。博世中国总裁陈玉东表示，疫情逐步缓解，我们看到了积极好转的趋势，目前博世的产出能力在30%到75%之间。    西门子医疗上海研发与生产基地被列入首批重点复工企业“白名单”，300多位员工在工厂闭环管理，已实现满负荷生产，以满足国内外市场需求。上海西门子医疗器械有限公司高级副总裁兼总经理孔军说，随着越来越多上下游企业复工，原材料供应逐渐步入正轨，能够满足制造要求。    启动复工至今，先尼科控股有限公司的青浦工厂陆续入驻了四批生产人员，目前产能已基本恢复。董事长鹿传欣说，复工的关键是上下游产业链逐步打通，“内蒙古、河南等地的供应商能够将原材料送进来，我们的产品也能从上海港出发，出口到美国、比利时等国家”。    三大困难，仍有待努力    复工复产的过程中，也并非没有困难。    博世中国表示，复工的工厂产能不足，主要是面临着闭环管理员工不足、物流不畅通以及各级供应商复产慢的三大困难。由于产业链很长，仍有待时间和共同的努力。    “汽车有很长的产业链，不仅有像博世这样的供应商以及他们的一级供应商，还有更多供应商的下级供应商，都需要恢复生产。供应链如果不形成‘链’，最终无法产出产品。”陈玉东表示，希望更多供应链上的伙伴能够快速复工。    拜尔斯道夫也有同感。陈圣祥告诉记者，“我们一种肉碱原料，这家原料供应商位于上海浦东康桥，前期一直处于封控中无法发货。最后是紧急协调了其东北工厂，从东北发货到苏州中转仓，再直发上海，才得以保证生产继续。”    但上海依然是外资高度重视的市场，加码中国的信心始终不变。    今年2月，先尼科宣布投资1亿美元，在上海奉贤区杭州湾开发区合计58亩土地上建设亚太区域总部。鹿传欣说，投资计划没有变，全年目标也没有变。    “中国继续保持博世集团最大的单一市场。”博世集团董事会主席史蒂凡·哈通博士表示：“长期而言，博世将继续坚持本土化发展。”    明治中国则表示，现在虽然面临着疫情的困难，但是在中国扩大投资规模的方针没有改变。“今后明治将在中国进行大规模的投资，扩大事业。”    而在妮维雅上海制造中心，飞速旋转的生产线正开足马力，为即将到来的618大促做好准备。雷开霆说，中国的大市场没有停滞，消费者对高质量产品的需求没有减少，我们正忙碌着如何赶回来、追上去。“从德国汉堡到中国上海，奋楫勇进的干劲没有变。”    本报记者  张钰芸,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/3.htm,5/20/22,第3版:要闻,,False
经历艰难险阻后正慢慢恢复如常,直击华山医院急诊科,,    本报记者  郜阳    华山路，梧桐掩映下，停在道路两旁的救护车顶上闪烁的蓝色灯光，分外晃眼。    担架床上，躺着双目无神、浑身乏力的老大爷，一旁的老伴回答着预检台“大白”的流调问询。隔着面屏和N95口罩，对听力下降的老年人讲话，护士得扯着嗓子喊。    再往里走，急诊大厅并不是外人想象中惊慌的样子——候诊的病人间隔坐开，躺在过道临时输液位上的患者不时抬起头看看输液的进度。有人因需吸氧口罩掉到了鼻子下，旁人立刻会投去警惕的目光；偶尔有戴着面屏、穿着隔离衣的人走进诊室，会让人错愕：她究竟是医护还是病人。    至少，在复旦大学附属华山医院急诊科主任陈明泉看来，如常的急诊似乎正在回归。    当然，那段艰难的日子里，这里和申城所有还敞开大门的急诊科一样，经历着特殊时期为到院患者抢回生命的惊心动魄。    危重患者更多了    自3月疫情暴发以来，位于静安区的华山医院总院急诊科每天都在高位运转，高峰时一天要涌入500多个病人，仅救护车就开来50多辆。“疫情期间，来到医院和回家都有种种羁绊，能到急诊科的都是拖不下去了的。”陈明泉说。    今年是急诊内科医生周文震工作的第三年，用他的话来说，疫情期间接诊了一名“可能一辈子都不会忘记的病人”。病人身体机能平稳，但胸闷气促、心跳特别快，喘得很厉害。一进到诊室，周文震第一反应是甲亢危象——这种又被称为“甲状腺风暴”的病死亡率很高。询问后得知，疫情期间药物不够，患者服用不规律；病人还罹患胆囊炎，感染也进一步诱发了甲亢危象。尽管在最短的时间里识别，但病情急转直下，最终还是没能救回来。    按惯例，急诊医生会根据到院患者病情的轻重缓急为他们分诊。第一类叫濒危病人，这类病人随时可能没命，必须立即送到抢救室；第二类叫危重病，患者症状严重，随时可能发展成一级；第三类病人在短时间内不会出现危及生命的症状；第四类病人没有急性发病的症状，一般被称为“流水病人”。很长时间里，一类、二类的病人占急诊患者的8%-10%，但在疫情下，陈明泉发现，这个数字几乎翻了一番，达到了15%-20%。    “前一段时间，无论是救护车送来的，还是自己过来的病人，病情都很重。”预检台护士说。大家心里更明白，防控形势如此严峻、交通那么不便利的情况下，患者还选择来到华山医院，是对医院的莫大信任，急诊人要尽全力救他们的命！    救治摆在第一位    陈明泉曾赴非洲参与埃博拉疫情防控，由他领衔的华山急诊与发热门诊一体化管理团队，疫情下发挥出“1+1＞2”的优势。“到急诊诊区的病人，都经过了预检台的筛查，一旦发现了高风险因素，就会被发热门诊收治；同时，发热门诊的诊治流程是由团队统一制定的，也能确保发热急症患者得到同质化的诊疗。”在预检台，陈明泉指着不远处的发热门诊标识向记者介绍。    “但无论如何，救治总是第一位的！”他严肃地说。只要是第一类、第二类的患者到院，会立即送往抢救室，抢救室满了还有缓冲抢救室；再满，还有应急抢救室！“一方面要维持生命体征的稳定，各类救治措施对症；另一方面开展防控下的检测，也很简单，先做抗原，几分钟就知道结果了，同步做核酸采样”。    记者在现场看到，预检台边上设有等候区。陈明泉解释，第三类、第四类急诊病人需要在此测温、做抗原，同步开展流行病学调查。一般5-10分钟左右，预检台的护士就能为他们做好分型，体温高、抗原阳性或有高风险因素就转到发热门诊，其他则到急诊诊区正常就医。    这场大上海保卫战中，申城各医疗机构相当一部分力量被抽调支援定点医院或是方舱医院，作为“原则性不停诊”的科室之一，急诊有没有出现医护力量捉襟见肘的时候？面对记者的疑问，陈明泉摆了摆手。“临港方舱医院的管理团队是华山医院，华山医院宝山院区也转为了定点医院。华山医院为急诊科和发热门诊配备了4部负压救护车，一旦发现了阳性感染者，我们的转运非常顺畅，也不会挤占市里120的资源。”在他看来，流程顺畅后，反而节省了劳动力。    专家门诊已恢复    3月28日，浦东新区开始封控管理。前一晚，很多家在浦东的医生、护士连夜拉着行李箱赶回了浦西的总院。之后50多天里，近130位急诊人三班倒战斗在一起，再也没有回过家。    “虽然我们在一线，但做好了防护，还是很安全的。”周文震说。从医没多久，就经历了这样特殊的考验，让这个年轻医生对急诊有了更深的认识。有人心疼急诊人的辛劳，但在小伙子看来，这恰恰是急诊医生最该上的时候。    急诊科的医护们明显感受到，5月中旬来，急诊正慢慢向常态化恢复，工作量接近疫情发生前的八到九成。本周，随着华山医院各专科门诊、检查检验项目的全面开放，急诊的压力也大大减轻，有些医护人员开始“走读”，进行“气泡式管理”。    向好发展下，却也生出了些意想不到的无奈——能“走读”的医护人员回家之路没那么舒心。离家上“疫”线时是众人眼中的天使，此时却成了需要提防的对象。“可谁会想着把病毒带回家呢？医务人员是防范做得最好的，知道自己做到位了才会踏上回家路。”陈明泉呼吁，白衣天使在前线的战斗已经很累了，请市民对他们多一些理解和照顾。    陈明泉自己的专家门诊也已经恢复，有些穿着防护服戴着面屏的病人让他有些哭笑不得。“新冠病毒毕竟还是通过呼吸道传播，来院戴好N95口罩，不聚集，做好手卫生就好。”陈明泉同时也是华山医院感染科主任医师，“穿戴严实反而会给医生查体造成困难”。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/4.htm,5/20/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
“数字伙伴助老保供”呵护城市“柔软”,这群话务员打电话帮老人订菜,,    “崔阿姨，侬好，我是‘数字伙伴助老保供’客服人员，想关心关心侬，屋里向小菜还够（口+伐）？”昨天，电信114话务员吉佳慧打出50多通这样的电话，对方都是不会熟练使用智能手机的老年人。这些年轻话务员用亲切的上海话，跟老人们拉家常、问需求、帮订菜。    近一个月，共呼叫18000多户独居老年家庭，其中1377户老人用电话订购的方式买到了生活物资。这背后，是一个平台、三方力量共同发力，呵护疫情下脆弱和柔软的群体。    三方接力  怎么方便怎么来    “不到万不得已，很多老年人都不会开口求助。”陈兴杰在上海智慧城市发展研究院负责数字伙伴促进中心的工作，日常工作之一就是帮助老年人融入数字生活。尽管接触过不少擅用智能手机的老人，但她依然觉得，让老年人用手机团购、抢菜，太难了，尤其是超过80岁的独居老人，远离数字生活的他们越来越沉默。但沉默，不意味着被遗忘。    4月起，陈兴杰加入“数字伙伴助老保供”专项行动。“我们要用最快的方式筛选出最需要服务的老年人，用他们最能接受的方式提供服务。”经过多番讨论，一个链接三方力量的数字保供平台成立了：上海电信号百公司建立了一支30人组成的助老话务小分队，根据首批试点街道梳理的助老名单，打电话询问需求；家乐福、大润发、华润万家等保供企业提供套餐、专人配送；街道居委组织志愿团队完成“最后100米”送货到家并代收货款。    具体落实时，发现问题很多：怎么沟通能让老人说出需求；套餐品种、价格怎么定；用老年人习惯的现金支付是否可行；志愿者上门配送碰到“阳楼”怎么办；老人电话订购后，物资到了又说不要了，如何解决……    起初，团队每天都要开好几个“复盘会”，梳理流程中的“堵点”，光套餐品种，就讨论了十几种方案。    居委垫付  老人可以用现金    从老人订购到拿到物资，大多在24小时内完成，最长不超过48小时。疫情下，这样高效流转是如何做到的？“我们一开始想开发个小程序，但发现‘助老保供’过程中有很多环节需要实时沟通，不管用哪种数字化工具都是为了解决问题。为提高效率，我们每个街道建了2个微信群，大群有相关领导和各方联络人员，定岗到人；小群里是执行人员，负责落实。”    陈兴杰介绍，每晚6时，114话务团队梳理一天的订单后，发送到小群；保供企业相关负责人群内沟通配送时间、收款方式等，将物资打包后的照片发群；出发后，再把车辆照片和路线图发到群里，方便志愿者第一时间掌握物资配送动态。    在北新泾街道，居委干部和志愿者组成送货小分队，在每个小区门口设置收货点，与保供企业无缝衔接；彭浦新村街道辖区老人多、需求高，33个居民区均配备专职人员，将助老保供套餐及时送到老人家中。    不少老人提出，要用现金支付。团队就与街道居委沟通后，确定由居委先行垫付。有退货情况，居委先内部协调，看能否转让，若转不了，保供企业兜底处理。    4月18日，第一通外呼电话接通，助老保供平台在三方力量的助推下运转起来，目前已覆盖到曹杨新村、北新泾、彭浦新村、临汾路、新华路等7个街道。    启发需求  沟通方案十几版    “我们挑选了会说上海话，耐心细致、沟通能力强的骨干成员，加入到助老团队。能帮助到老年人，大家都很有成就感。”114“助老保供”话务团队的负责人曹玲介绍，如何能让老人明确表达需求，团队总结了十几版沟通方案。    吉佳慧记得有一次给一位80多岁的老人打电话。对方说，已经很久没有人跟他说话了。“老人没有订购物资，但跟我聊了蛮久的。我就像对自己爷爷一样跟他拉拉家常，老人觉得特别开心。”    很多老人听力不佳，沟通起来颇为费力，尤其是涉及到套餐的品种价格，要反反复复说好几遍，小吉从不厌烦。“一通电话下来，老人要说好多个‘谢谢侬’。”    据介绍，“数字伙伴助老保供”专项行动将覆盖更多社区，与相关公益性服务平台对接，争取更多的服务资源融入助老保供体系。本报记者  叶薇,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/5.htm,5/20/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
90岁外婆重病卧床　积痰太多仅靠人工挖实在“撑勿牢”,全城搜索  凑齐货源  吸痰机和管子都有了,,    求助    外婆今年90岁，重病瘫痪在床，已处于“植物人”状态。老人口腔、喉咙、肺部经常充满痰液。由于小区封控，无法外出就医，即使遵照医嘱按时服药，炖煮冰糖雪梨食疗化痰，我还是要日夜看护，生怕一口堵住喉咙的痰夺去外婆的生命。我天天虽然用手指头包着纱布帮外婆挖痰，但次数一多，伊的嘴巴都肿起来了。要是屋里厢有台大功率的吸痰机就好了，但现在寻来寻去就是寻勿着！    宝山区顾村镇菊泉街55弄  王女士    帮忙>>>    在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，一说起外婆的境况，王女士禁不住连声抽泣。她告诉记者，去年她外婆摔了一跤后，一直毫无知觉地躺在了床上。没有吸痰机，仅靠全天候的“人工挖痰”，万一有个疏忽，就是性命攸关的大事。孝顺的王女士不仅照料了外婆20多年，还要看护着70岁的残疾母亲。“一天24小时要竖起耳朵听牢外婆的动静，还要服侍阿拉妈妈。我也已经45岁了，真是有点撑勿牢了！真希望有人能帮帮我。”    记者随即向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出信息，平台的小伙伴们又立刻开启了全城搜索模式，终于从淘宝卖家那里顺藤摸瓜从上海经销商找来了大功率的吸痰机，随后还自己掏钱请了跑腿小哥把这台“救命稻草”送到了王女士所住的小区。而公益企业百联集团旗下上药集团在得知老人的难处后，迅速调配货源，赠送了50根吸痰管。    回访时，王女士在不停表达谢意的同时，也分享了街道、居委会和好邻居们给予自己的感动。“为了防止外婆便秘，我需要莴苣叶子打成汁给她吃。邻居们晓得了这桩事情，阿拉屋里向就再也没断过莴苣叶子，疫情期间也是如此。”王女士说，外婆要更换胃管和导尿管，小区封控，是街道和居委会叫来120，把老人送到医院救了急，“现在伊拉还帮阿拉外婆和姆妈，安排好了一日三顿的老年餐。”话到此处，王女士的声音又有些颤抖，“有了这么多人的关心，再难的日子都能挺过去！”  本报记者  王军,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/6.htm,5/20/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,新冠之患,,    吴霜    小谢，是我当年在美国生活时的朋友，现在早已是老谢了，他们全家至今生活在美国。最近，老谢全家人经历了一场生死之战，简直是九死一生。怎么回事？    老谢夫妇是上海人，当年我曾经写过一篇文章描述南方人和北方人的不同生性不同习惯，那篇对比写法的散文曾引为许多人的笑谈，文中的南方人原型就是老谢夫妇。我回国以来很长时间没有见过他们了。前天，我和先生查理微信通话时，他告诉了我老谢的经历，竟吓出我一身的冷汗。    老谢的岳母三十多年前就从上海去美国和老谢一家生活了。如今年过九旬，身体逐渐衰弱，记忆力减退，腿脚力量减退，视觉感知能力也随之减退。去年11月底感恩节时在家里摔了一跤，腿骨折了。由此，生活变得十分不便，随时需要照顾。于是老谢夫妇商量后决定送母亲去了一个条件不错的养老院。谁知在养老院，岳母感染了新冠肺炎。    大家都知道，老年人感染新冠肺炎的几率比较高，他们抵抗力差，容易被病毒侵犯，更何况还是一位得了阿尔茨海默症的老人呢。岳母是上海人，在美国多年还是不会说英文，这下是真麻烦了。老人的症状越来越严重，发烧后的老人心智几乎丧失了，表现为急躁无理，行为失调，护理人员对她讲的话完全听不懂。平日里吃饭已经需要人喂，而这时的老人见到照顾她的不是家里亲人，拒绝吃饭，本来西式的简餐她也吃不惯，于是情形和绝食也差不多，情绪失控，随之大小便失禁，且不会自主如厕。老人后来发展到脱掉衣服，撕扯棉被，屋子里的东西到处乱扔……护理人员根本没有办法照顾她，因为会被她暴力地拒绝。于是有一天，当老谢他们去探望老人的时候，看到的是头发散乱浑身脱光情绪失控且到处是屎尿的老人的惨状。    老谢一家简直快精神崩溃了。这时候，他们的女儿、老人的外孙女站出来起了作用。这个女孩当年曾经是我儿子童年的玩伴，我还记得她小时候和我儿子一起学算术时比赛谁算得快的情形。后来她学了护理专业，现在她已经是一位熟练的护士了。远在加州的外孙女一听外婆的情形就急了，她拿起电话用熟练的专业语言和养老院的管理人员对话，质问他们是怎么照顾老人的，为什么会把老人照顾成如此的惨状，如果不马上改观就去法院起诉他们的失责，甚至不作为。同时她告诉爸爸妈妈尽快把外婆接回家里照顾，否则老人家性命休矣！    老谢夫妇按女儿的叮嘱去养老院把岳母接回了家里，老人情绪有了安慰，居住环境得到了改善，身上的味道也没有了。但紧接着一波未平一波又起。先是老谢的太太很快被传染，出现新冠肺炎症状，之后是小女儿着道，最后老谢自己也出现咽痛、咳嗽、发烧的现象。全家人只好又去医院检查，结果是太太、女儿都是阳性，老谢是阴性。老谢也纳闷，怎么自己有各种新冠症状，却是阴性呢？无论如何，全家人一天之内都被感染，可真是此生从未体验过的经历！美国医院里目前最可怕的其实并不是没有医疗手段，而是奇缺护理人员。住院治疗几乎是不可能的，没有人手照顾你，如果耽搁在医院，恐怕都要遭受到老谢岳母在养老院体验过的经历吧？医院给开了一堆药物，拿回家去，自助解困吧。    他们回到家里，一人一屋，各自隔离。而照顾大家的重担只能落在了暂时被测定为阴性的老谢身上了。老谢忍受着喉咙刀割一样的疼痛，被高热搞得头昏脑涨的折磨，做饭、分食、分药、送水，外加洗漱照料，清洗杯盘碗筷、收拾屋子，开窗通风，不一而足。当然，还要忍受一贯喜欢干净的太太被病痛折磨得脾气变坏，对岳母不厌其烦地贴身照料。我想，老谢一定经历了多少倍于当初初到美国时感受过的困难体验吧？好在将近两个月之后，他们全家人都慢慢痊愈，惊险过关，危机解除。看来这新冠病毒经过三年多在人间的周转历练，正在被人类这个世界上最智慧的物种逐渐掌握而最终会达到完全控制的状态。    而我体会最深刻的一点则是，如果老谢的岳母是美国家庭的老人的话，很可能无法活到现在。或许只有尊重、孝敬老一辈的中国人才会全身心地甚至是牺牲自身利益的投入来奋力保全老人的生命。如果是美国人，很可能会把老人的性命留在养老院而保全家里其他年轻成员的存活率。    中国人啊，为我们自己的民族性自豪吧。老谢，好样的！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/7.htm,5/20/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,寂静之声,,    陈苏    浦西封控的清晨，母亲在微信里说，好像太安静了。是啊，从阳台望去，熟悉的小区犹如一幅静物画，每个窗户里活动的身影，似乎在演绎着一部默片。一树树樱花竞相绽放，烂漫中透着几分落寞；倏忽掠过的鸟儿划出动感的弧线，叽叽喳喳的小合唱格外清脆。    寂静中耳朵特别敏锐，稍有风吹草动立马捕捉。几天过去，已经分辨得出静谧中的各种声响，动静大的可能是发保障物资，声响小的可能是志愿者发抗原试剂。倘若声响不大但连续不断的，十有八九是核酸检测。果然，“大白”和志愿者们都已严阵以待，小区居民分批出动。那天全市统一测核酸，我留意了一下“大白”的胸卡，感动瞬间涌起。因为这场疫情，这些外地的医务人员驰援上海，出现在某个陌生的小区，我们唯有用手势表达谢意。    寂静中不绝于耳的是手机微信“叮咚”声，楼组微信群热闹堪比工作群。当每个人被隔绝在家门里，微信群成为了连接人与世界的重要纽带。平时在电梯里匆忙点个头的邻居，如今以昵称在群里朝夕相处，守望相助。虽然我和母亲小区仅隔一碗汤的距离，但封控却让这三四百米的距离难以逾越。进了母亲楼组微信群后，随着“叮咚”声，时时看到母亲小区的动态，颇有在场感。然而，这波疫情的纠缠远远超出大家的预期，家家户户的冰箱渐渐没了底气。微信群里“百团大战”迅速打响，蔬菜、面包、牛奶等团长各显神通，团员接龙热火朝天，Excel达人表格上户名、货品、数量做得煞煞清，当然不忘给辛苦的物业人员送上一份。    寂静中“嘎吱嘎吱”的车轮声听来特别美妙，平时蛰伏在角落里的平板车大显身手。在物流极为困难的那几天，团购物资通常半夜三更突如其来。志愿者夜行小分队神速行动，消杀、理货、分送一气呵成。早晨打开门，心心念念的物品近在眼前，恍若田螺姑娘悄然来过。小区里卸货的声响越来越频繁，保障物资一批批分送到家，大家逐步实现了从蔬菜到肉蛋的自由。群里“叮咚”声更热闹了，巧手邻居们又是秀自制蛋糕、小笼包、铜锣烧，又是分享花盆种葱、水培蔬菜的成果。    寂静中会听到往常不曾听到的声音。尽管小心翼翼屏牢多日，楼里还是有几户居民先后中招，好在大家无一抱怨，各种安慰。中招的邻居也坦诚相告发现过程，还发来方舱生活写真。疫情下的楼组，成了命运共同体。一位老人突发不适，楼里医务工作者立即线上会诊；二孩妈妈因为丈夫被封在公司，独自带两个孩子而焦虑，我向她推荐了我们出版社的绘本视频；群里冒出一道题：求“破镜难圆”的原理，立马有邻居给出“分子的引力和斥力”教科书级别的解答，群友们也顺便复习了一下初中物理……    各种杂音困扰之时，不妨静静地倾听自己内心的声音。当我们的物理距离被隔开，而心灵距离却可以如此接近；人与人的接触究竟多少距离才合适，真正的无接触是否只有人工智能才能实现？亲历这次疫情的每个人，心灵的免疫系统也经受了一次考验，重新审视什么是最值得珍惜的。尤其是生活在物质充裕年代的Z世代，习惯了动动手指、物品速达，一切都so easy，难得体验了一回如何把卷心菜、胡萝卜搭配出N种菜式，会为绿豆发芽而欣喜，会细细品味每一口食物。    疫情终会过去，当重启键开动时，城市交响曲又将响起，每个人都将回到常态生活。但，2022年的春天注定不会被淡忘，你会想起家门口邻居送来的那把曾金贵堪比名牌包的小葱，会记得土豆也会开出奇异的小花。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-20/8.htm,5/20/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

金山区枫泾镇枫阳居民区党总支书记叶彩凤,“清零”之后重逢　竟像老了十岁,,    5月20日，忙完新一轮核酸检测后的金山区枫泾镇枫阳居民区党总支书记叶彩凤说，“比第一次整整提速2个小时。一切越来越顺了！”虽然工作比之前轻松许多，但是她一脸的疲惫依旧还很明显。    3月14日下午，叶彩凤接到因疫情封控管理的通知后，带领整个团队就投入了日夜作战的极限节奏。枫阳新村是枫泾镇第一个封控的小区。“我当时第一反应是，我们没有经验，也没有‘同桌’可以‘抄作业’。镇定下来后，我对班子成员说，我们要做好，做出一个‘可复制经验’来。”叶彩凤告诉记者。    居委会挑灯夜战，彻夜明亮的灯光引来更多“同路人”。当晚就有30余名志愿者联系叶彩凤。15日中午前，枫阳新村疫情防控临时党支部委员会成立，并建立起了一支有60人的志愿者队伍，分组负担起了核酸检测、收集清运垃圾、分送外卖和快递等工作。    3月16日、17日，枫阳辖区内的正荣璟园和佳田苑也相继进入封控。有了枫阳新村“打前站”的经验，核酸检测和生活保障工作快速上路。    3月28日开始的全镇域静态管理，对其他村和居民区来说，是一道新的管理考题，而对于叶彩凤来说，是将已经理顺的工作进一步优化。    枫阳居民区下辖14个小区，近7500人口。在给居委工作人员分工作条线的基础上，叶彩凤以初期设置的6个核酸检测点为基础，重新规划了9个服务点，每个点位分别配置志愿者力量负责核酸检测、买菜、配药等服务。封控初期，枫阳新村的“配药小分队”效率突出。3月28日，进入全域静态管理后，每个服务点更是配备了两名志愿者专门“接单”配药，整个居民区每天能处理100多个配药需求。买菜方面，初期都是居民们“点菜”，志愿者记录后集中采购。随后，叶彩凤与志愿者合作制作了更加便捷、图文并茂的“配送清单”，让居民勾选。    从3月14日辖区第一个小区进入封控管理，到上海实现社会面清零的5月17日，60余天，叶彩凤只回过3次家。长久不见的家里小辈看到51岁的叶彩凤后惊呼：“你怎么像老了10岁！”所幸基层工作者的辛苦终有回报，随着枫泾这座小镇复产复商复市的顺利推进，叶彩凤和志愿者们也调整了步伐，渐渐回归到日常的工作节奏。    本报记者  屠瑜  通讯员  范黎平,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-21/3.htm,5/21/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False

失业独居青年抑郁  囊中羞涩无人倾诉,心理“按摩”资助返乡  公益联盟让他重拾希望,,    在前天的新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，来自安徽合肥的周先生向“新民帮侬忙”求助，他患有严重的重度抑郁症，并伴有间歇性心脏病。小区封控后，病情不断加重，生活愈发窘迫。没有收入、回不了家乡、催房租信息不断发来……“我天天吃饭都吃不下，睡觉都睡不着！”在低声哭泣中，周先生一句“我把治病的药全丢了，真的不想活下去了”，顿时牵动了记者和无数网友的心。    多番打击  重度抑郁    人命关天！面对一条鲜活的生命，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟再一次发起全城“最紧急救援”。公益机构上海海涛社工服务社的国家二级心理咨询师、中级社工师李潇华迅速介入，慢慢找出了周先生厌世轻生的“心有千千结”——32岁周先生独自租住在闵行区申北路135弄，来上海打拼已有10年，由于经营不善，辛辛苦苦支撑多年的寿司店只能关门歇业。而就在事业陷入最低谷的时候，妻子也弃他而去。但为了安徽老家的母亲和5岁的女儿，从老板到外卖小哥，他依然自立自强，没日没夜地在外奔波，用自己的辛劳养家糊口。    但疫情来袭，小区封控，一下子又将周先生推入了生活的最困境。1个月3000多元的房租，一家老小的吃用开销……压得已失去工作的他简直喘不过气来，而这一切他又不愿意告诉家人，生怕他们陷入担忧，只能全憋在自己的心里。没日没夜的胡思乱想，引发了重度抑郁症。    李潇华告诉记者，生意失败、婚姻破裂，一次次的打击其实已经深埋下严重的病根和隐患，一触即发。要想“救下这条生命”，就需要帮他走出现实的困境：首先，能不能停止催租，请租赁平台在押金中结算；其次，他身上只剩下向妹妹借来的500元钱，回老家的路费和自费隔离的钱能不能给予资助；再次，能不能让他尽快离开小区，回到安徽合肥，找到工作重新谋生。    缓交房租  获得捐款    得知这一切后，记者立刻开启了“救人三部曲”。在与房屋租赁平台自如公司取得联系后，第一时间就得到了最肯定的承诺：立刻让后台停发“催租”信息，租金等结算事项待周先生一切恢复正常后再议。    而在“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟里，公益企业上海临吉地市容服务管理有限公司以最快速度给出了响应。作为安徽老乡，公司总经理王安雷先行给周先生转去8000元，“这是回家必须的费用。高铁票我们可以帮你买，以后的工作我们也可以帮你想办法落实！”短信中，王安雷给了周先生最大的支撑。    随后，在记者多方联络下，好消息接踵而来——周先生在上海的租住地小区同意开具离沪证明，周先生在安徽合肥的所在小区同意接收。5月20日，当再次拨通周先生的电话时，虽然声音仍有些低沉无力，但话语里充满了对生的向往和期盼：“我已经请志愿者帮我重新去配药了。我会好好照顾自己，会让自己好好活下去的。等我有了工作，必须努力努力再努力，用自己挣来的工资还上大家对我的资助。这个世界还是好人多，我要像他们一样，用更长的生命去回报社会，去回报这份救命之恩！”本报记者  钱俊毅  徐驰    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月20日11时至5月21日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求197件，其中紧急类诉求102件，已推动解决86件（含“公益联盟” 17件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-21/5.htm,5/21/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False

,人间无烟火,——解读王维,    张炜    一般来说，诸种文学形式中，小说这种文体的烟火气较重，好像天生即为此类体裁。而诗与散文较高一级，通常没有多少烟火气。萌芽于南朝时期的词，当是诗的一种别体，这种艺术形式虽然属于诗的大类，却被认为有很重的烟火气。这是由它的出身而定：源于民间，兴于宴所，常常生成和流传于酒坊瓦肆和歌馆楼台。后来进入宫廷和府衙，为有闲阶层大量使用，其娱乐性进一步覆盖了其他。可见艺术形式之出身确实重要。小说为民间故事缘发，最后演变孕化为不同的质地：在一部分清贵的知识分子那里变成了高雅文体，呈现很强的诗性，反之在另一些人手里则非常俗腻。其实不仅小说如此，诗也如此，比如艳体诗、应制诗、某些酬答唱和诗等。可见仅仅用形式和体裁加以区别，并不是一个根本的方法，还须看创造者的生命质地，由此才能最终决定一件艺术品的格调与器局。    “烟火气”来自生活、基层与民间，并非全是负面的意义。《诗经》的“风诗”就来自民间。只有洞悉烟火，有怒有喜且有激越，才有杰出的艺术创造。如果真的失去了“烟火气”，还会留下多少诗？王维的主要作品绝无烟火气，这既是其艺术特质与不可替代的优长，即独有的审美品格，又可以说是他难以抵达更高的艺术层级的主因。“右丞诗大抵无烟火气，故当于笔墨外求之。”（清代·黄周星《唐诗快》）可见事物两分，有得有失。人生之多艰，苦怀与悲怒，存在于一个人的生命底色之中，沉淀下来并且强烈感受，唯有如此，他们的倾吐才会感人肺腑，才会成为一切艺术之主力和骨干。王维之价值不在于此或不尽于此，在他这里或者为超然之意境、之才趣，由此而产生其他效应。    王维诗作佛性超然的审美品质，其价值当然无可否认，这尤其表现在他的一些代表作中，也为历代读者所喜爱的原因。有些佳句实在凸显出难忘的绝美风韵，尽管还不够多，但只能是卓越的手笔，它们是结晶，是象征，是诗人不能消失的身影。这样的创造时时弹拨我们的心灵。    我们无法将李杜诗章巨大的审美快感，用以衡度王维。因为这不是同一的性质和标准。这样讲并非是混淆和舍弃艺术价值的比较，因为艺术标准确实存在；所以我们说，王维的艺术，最终既不可替代，也无法与李杜同日而语。    当一种艺术失去烟火气之后，付出的代价是巨大的。因为人生之本质就是艰辛曲折，虽然需要王维之超脱和清美去抚慰，但是更加需要揭示真相，这种清醒的认知所激发的力量，似乎更为迫切。每一个人都需要直面人生，需要这些经验的扩大和延伸，这是所有艺术家、思想者更高的价值之所在。自我修炼，一切随遇而安，乐观通达，是一种令人羡慕和向往的境界，并会引发许多类似的实践；但这样一种境界内在的包裹到底是什么、隐伏了多少痛苦又置换了多少喜悦，我们都不得而知。看上去是优美和谐的另一种人生，仿佛进入了一场无痛手术，然而手术还是要进行下去。凡手术都有割除，有流血，一切将浓缩在一场无形无觉的梦中。梦醒之后，一切仍然不是空白。它发生过了，它在客观之内和主观之外，当主观的理性认知找回这段空白的时候，又将是别种情形。当心灵的结晶，即诗与文呈现这种空白的时候，依凭来自哪里？来自回告、追忆？他者还是自己的记忆？后者显然不能。那么这场空寂就真的是空寂了，生命也就多少有点浪费和悲哀。    王维作为一个诗人、艺术家，他的全部作品里竟很少情事与趣记，这与历史上、与同时期的许多诗人都大为不同。屈原、陶渊明、李白、杜甫及后来的韩愈、白居易、杜牧、李商隐、欧阳修、苏东坡、陆游、辛弃疾等，都是在两性之爱的表达上非常凸显和用力的，其中不乏浪漫传闻。清苦安静如王维，与诗之内容何等一致。虽然不能说文学艺术必须有异性之爱，但可以认为，一切艺术表达都与这种生命力的演化与转化有关。“丧妻不娶，孤居三十年。”（《新唐书·王维传》）王维与妻子生活得时间很短，妻子去世后一人独处，直到终老。这种情形实为罕见。这可能与其佛教静修生活有关，但作为一个人、一个诗人，在情事方面如此淡漠、孤绝，特别是诗文中之断绝，还是多少超出意料。这一切必然会影响到诗性品质。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-21/7.htm,5/21/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,小满，绿叶成阴子满枝,,    韩可胜    小满，第八个节气。夏天的第二个节气。“满”，《说文解字》解释为“盈溢也”，意思是水满了。后来延伸开来，就不仅仅是指水了。“黄四娘家花满蹊”“山雨欲来风满楼”“满面尘灰烟火色”“春色满园关不住”……延伸出各种具象和抽象的满。而“小满”也有两种解释，一种解释为水，因为降雨多，江河渐满。另一种解释，小麦之类谷物开始灌浆。《月令七十二候集解》说“物至于此小得盈满”，泛指各种果实，又不仅仅指小麦了。虽然还在孟夏，但春天已杳无踪迹，“狂风落尽深红色，绿叶成阴子满枝。”果实们正在趋于饱满的路上。一切只是“小满”，还不到“大满”。    然而二十四节气中，压根儿就没有“大满”。小与大相对，节气中有小暑，就有大暑；有小雪，就有大雪；有小寒，就有大寒。唯独有小满，没有大满。为什么呢？原因在于中国人对“满”充满了警惕，所谓“满招损，谦受益”。许多耳熟能详的观念都与此有关，比如：日中则移，月盈即亏；物极必反，否极泰来；盛极则衰，枯荣轮转……我小时候读书不错，听到最多的教诲就是不要“骄傲自满”，耳朵都听出茧来。连带生活中，酒喝六分醉，饭吃七分饱——什么事情都要恰到好处，不要太“满”。    每个节气都分三候。小满第一候，“苦菜秀”。苦菜是古诗文中的常客，宋代诗人王之望说：“朝来食指动，苦菜入春盘”，可见它自古就在人们的食谱之中。晚清重臣张之洞也有这样的诗句：“上山采苦菜，青青不盈筐。”“秀”是抽穗开花的意思。苦菜属于菊科，苦菜花颇有一点菊花的姿容。小时候看过一部电影《苦菜花》，主题曲是那个时代的经典，我至今能想起那旋律。作家吴伯箫说：“感人的歌声留给人的记忆是长远的。”一点不假。    小满第二候，“靡草死”。靡草，一种纤细柔弱、随风倒伏的草。“靡”是随风倒下的意思，比如“风靡”“所向披靡”。古人认为，万物应时而动，这种草“感阴而生”，阳气强的时候，就会枯萎死去。“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”，靡草再生又是明年。所谓“人生一世，草木一秋”，大自然的有情体现在它的无情之中。    小满第三候，“麦秋至”，麦子成熟了。“秋”是“禾谷熟也”，成熟的意思。宋朝多位诗人写有“小麦青青大麦黄”，不知道谁才是著作权所有者。现在稻米是第一主食，东北都以生产优质大米著称。可是在历史上，麦才是黄河流域的主角。“四月南风大麦黄，枣花未落桐叶长”，小满节气，最是青黄不接的时候。好在大麦收获了。大麦收获和水稻插秧几乎是同步的事情，诗人们欣赏“人间四月芳菲尽，山寺桃花始盛开”的时候，农民迎来了忙碌的季节：“乡村四月闲人少，才了蚕桑又插田。”    比起感人的歌声，饥饿给人的记忆更加刻骨铭心。从记事开始，每到小满节气，肚皮空空如也，是一点都不满的。哭着要吃饭，让大我仅四岁的姐姐也无可奈何。好在一切都已过去，全民已经小康。专家们为小康制定了许多标准，许多标准都把年收入放在了第一位。在我看来，第一标准不是有钱，是随时随地不担心吃的。温饱二字，“饱”比“温”更重要。唐代诗人吕岩以艳羡的口气描写牧童：“归来饱饭黄昏后，不脱蓑衣卧月明。”很有画面感。这个吕岩可不是一般人，他还有一个更加广为人知的名字：吕洞宾，不错，“八仙”之一的吕洞宾，道教的一代宗师。可见，即便在仙人眼里，能吃饱、有自由，才是幸福的生活。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-21/8.htm,5/21/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

普陀区石泉路街道书记工作室带教书记陈文伟,沉入社区重返岗  带教抗疫两兼顾,,    有些杂乱的办公室，临时堆起的纸箱，窄窄的休息椅，简单的餐饭，不停地奔波……这是普陀区石泉路街道书记工作室带教书记陈文伟和年轻社区干部们，一个多月来的生活常态。从3月底起，今年69岁、当过居民区党组织书记的陈文伟，在不同的社区忙碌、支援，带教抗疫两不误。    中宁社区是一个比较大型的社区，面积大，就意味着闭环管理上会有不少困难。“一开始，有很多事情社区干部从来没有做过，手忙脚乱就会出一些小问题。”在这样的情况下，“老书记”陈文伟沉入社区支援徒弟们。接下来，不论是组织居民做核酸，还是分发政府大礼包等社区里一系列琐碎而又重要的事情，她都是带头干，没有一次缺席。在一次药品发放时，要先把药品一份份打包好，她做到手指头都磨出了血。    “言传身教是最好的老师。参与其中，才能更好体会到社区工作的不易和年轻干部的辛苦，也才能更有针对性地帮助和指导他们。”陈文伟说，进入社区带教年轻书记，主要就是希望在实际工作中教会年轻人开展社区工作的方式方法。    在石泉路街道信阳第二居民区指导抗疫工作时，陈文伟发现由于社区人力有限，居民区党组织书记和主任，每天都把大量时间和精力耗费在收集医保卡、配药发药、保供发菜等事务性工作上。陈文伟认为，这样不利于社区整体抗疫工作的组织安排，便第一时间和街道党建办商议，下沉一些机关干部，同时调配更多社区报到党员志愿者参加志愿服务。“我们对有限的居委会工作人员重新安排，将下沉干部和党员志愿者组成配药小组，从而把书记和主任从事务性工作中解放出来，发挥‘领头雁’的组织协调专长，真正把社区抗疫工作牵起来、统起来。”    陈文伟把以前拆违、攻坚等工作中的群众工作方法，手把手教给年轻社区干部，让他们越是在特殊时期，越要增强与群众的沟通，社区工作人员要以最大的耐心对待每一个居民，特别是有诉求有怨气的居民，不管问题能不能最终解决，都要把相关情况解释清楚。陈文伟经常用这句话教导年轻书记们：“对待居民要报以最大的耐心，多一些爱心，少一些急躁，才能多一分理解和支持。”    无论是以前担任居民区党组织书记期间，还是当前重返社区抗疫一线期间，陈文伟的手机始终对居民公开，并始终保持24小时在线。她耐心接待居民来访、接听居民来电，听他们“吐吐槽”，和他们谈谈心。无论时间有多晚，她都会和年轻的社区干部们分析复盘每一天抗疫工作内容，总结经验、补齐短板。    吃住在社区2个多月了，陈文伟抗疫期间没有回过一次家，只有谈起家中年幼的小孙女时，一度哽咽。    本报记者  江跃中,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/3.htm,5/22/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,跨区公共交通逐步恢复,,    地铁  轨交3、6、10、16号线恢复运营    终于能回家了    今天开始，轨交3、6、10、16号线恢复运营，运营时段均为7时到20时，行车间隔约20分钟。    9时刚过，记者在轨交3号线上海火车站站看到，有乘客拖着行李箱来赶火车，有乘客拿着手机定格站外风景，也有乘客坐上久违的地铁踏上复工的路程，市民能够先扫“场所码”再进站。    大二学生彭博涵坐着校车从临港大学城来到此地，想坐地铁回镇坪路的家。“从2月底在学校封控管理到现在终于能回家了。”他说，“在学校只有做核酸时能好好晒太阳，现在坐上3号线晒着太阳，心情太棒了。”    这段特殊时期让彭博涵收获最大的是“学会了时间管理”。“都说封闭的日子在寝室很无聊，确实是这样。一开始大家不知道干什么好，但渐渐都找到了自己想做的事。”他举例自己就好好研究了计算机编程方面的课程，“敲敲代码”时间过得很快。    在中山公园地铁站，我们遇到了在仁济医院血透科工作的庞慧华，她从3月31日起就没有回过家。“幸好今天地铁部分恢复了，我可以10号线换3号线回家。”她说，这虽然不是平日里回家的线路，但能踏上归程心里还是很高兴。    不过，休息很短暂。“今晚我就要回医院了，因为血透室从周一到周日都要开放。”当发现明天的首班地铁并不能让她及时回到工作岗位时，她决定今晚就回单位坚守，“这次疫情中，血透病人这个群体越来越被大家了解，他们需要定期治疗，不能耽误。”    在曹杨路站，庞慧华和我们告别时特别提到了同事们：“有30多名医生、护士、工勤一直驻守在医院，他们每个人都不容易，都付出了很多。”她想告诉大家，通过千千万万个医护人员的全力以赴，还有社会各界的共同努力，上海一定能够战胜疫情。    上海火车站站区副站长朱林告诉记者，截至今天10时30分，车站客流平稳，对于出示“场所码”这一最新举措都能够配合。“今天有5个4号线来支援的工作人员在各个出入口负责引导乘客扫码。”朱林建议乘客分三步走：“站外扫码”“站内核验”“绿码进站”，未来随着客流回升，运营方也会继续加强引导，“同时，作为上海的门户车站，这里的消毒频次也保持每隔4小时擦拭喷洒一次，确保市民的出行安全”。    本报记者  董怡虹  陈炅玮    公交   273条公交线路重新行驶在上海街头    车来了车来了    乘车出门  激动    273条公交线路今天起又行驶在熟悉的上海街头，为申城增添了一抹亮色。    “车来了车来了，我要去龙柏新村探亲，可算等到了。”7时，在71路中运量外滩终点站，一名中年男乘客提前15分钟等候在站点，搭乘最早一班车。    同样上车的还有一对中老年夫妻，郑老伯告诉记者，今天起了个大早准备去瑞金医院，坐71路到茂名北路之后再骑共享单车，路程就近多了。    “71路还可以和轨交3号线延安西路站、10号线水城路站换乘。”驾驶员方进介绍，今天上午的乘客大多都是去医院看病。为了给乘客提供最好的服务，4时30分，他就和乘务员蒋梦娇等工作人员起床准备发车。5时40分，71路空车驶离申昆路枢纽站，朝外滩终点站开去，为今天翘首以盼的乘客带来停滞许久的乘车服务。    “上车前请出示随申码，上车后请扫描车厢内‘场所码’，戴好口罩哦。”蒋梦娇提醒着乘车的安全事项，许久未见的乘客们纷纷主动配合。    70路公交也在首批恢复地面公交的名单之中，途经新华医院、复旦大学附属妇产科医院杨浦院区、中医医院和江湾医院的它，也在这个阳光明媚的清晨迎来了第一批乘客。    在龙江路站点，“老面孔”邢阿姨一上车就热络地和驾驶员季云豪打招呼：“小师傅，我总算坐上70路公交车了，这段时间我每次去新华医院都要骑半小时自行车，今天方便嘞，十几分钟就能到。”邢阿姨的语气中难掩激动。    熟悉的马路，熟悉的方向盘让季师傅格外感慨，时隔近两个月，行驶在马路上，沿街店铺也陆续开了起来，“感觉上海在慢慢回归”。    搭车看病  方便    虹口区甘河路上的岳阳医院门口，52岁的刘先生掏出手机，主动扫了“场所码”。测量体温后刘先生顺利进入院区。    刘先生家住中山公园附近，是位痛风患者。前一阵，他痛风的老毛病又犯了，脚趾肿痛、无法行走。他选择先在岳阳医院互联网医院线上就诊。“这痛风发作起来真是要人命，根本没法动。医生在网上问诊后，给我开了药，还提醒我居家注意事项和痛风的生活指导。药快递上门，很方便。”服药两周后，刘先生脚趾红肿退了，也不痛了，这两天已经能走路了。他想着已经两个月没有复查血尿酸情况了，今天遇上一直看病的专家出诊，便趁着申城交通恢复运行的日子，赶紧坐轨交3号线到大柏树站来医院检查。    在门诊大厅，记者又遇到了几位搭乘123路或100路公交车来院就诊的老年人。    而在急诊，120送来了79岁的易奶奶，胸部CT显示易奶奶左侧第5-12肋骨多根多处骨折伴左侧胸腔积液。“患者8根肋骨多发性骨折，且已有血胸表现，情况危急，需要急诊手术。”心胸外科主任陈彤宇当机立断。虽然此时易阿婆的核酸报告超过时限，但救命要紧。易阿婆在医护人员的护送下，直接从急诊送入手术室专门手术间，陈彤宇主任穿上防护服为其进行肋骨内固定加胸腔镜下血胸清除术。    记者了解到，岳阳医院各科普通门诊在周一至周六全天和周日上午全面开放，门诊实行预约制，可通过医院微信服务号、电话预约或现场预约。专科门诊及专家门诊也已全部开放。院方提醒，请患者按预约时间段到院就诊。进入院区须扫“行程码”，核验绿码通行。凭48小时核酸检测阴性报告或现场抗原检测阴性结果进入门诊。口腔科、胃肠镜检查、耳鼻喉内镜等门诊、检查由于诊疗的特殊性，须持有24小时内核酸阴性报告。    截至11时，共有1302位患者到门诊就诊。    本报记者  任天宝  郜阳    出租车  巡游出租汽车专属车队护航    帮一个算一个    9时33分，强生出租车司机高学兵接到塘桥派出所发来的单子，驾车来到儿童医学中心2号门接出院的乘客。上车的是一对母子，宝宝仅一岁零四个月大，今天是他们第5次搭乘高师傅的出租车。    “宝宝前几天发高烧，叫了120救护车去医院，每次回家却成了难题，家里又离医院比较远，有23公里。我是通过家长群知道现在可以预约出租车从医院回家，特别感谢高师傅。”王女士坦言，每次看到“全副武装”的高师傅，就特别踏实安心，下车后，高师傅还会消毒车辆。    高学兵从5月12日起就开始出车，穿好防护服、戴好口罩是日常规范操作，既保护乘客，也保护自己。由于防护服的时效是5小时，高学兵每天要换3次。“每天9点到次日0点我都在，想着能帮一个算一个。”    从4月18日起，上海中心城区各医院病人出院，可预约巡游出租汽车回家。目前，强生出租50辆巡游出租汽车专属车队正投入运营。乘客需至少提前24小时拨打62580000叫车电话，进行出院点到点用车预约登记。出院用车当日，乘客需持有医院开具的出院证明和24小时核酸阴性报告。    本报记者  任天宝,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/4.htm,5/22/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,往日生活场景正在回来,,    移动营业厅    普陀    区内第一家移动营业厅复工    不到10分钟补好一张卡    早上7时，姜锡磊如常醒来。只不过，地点从家里换到了工作单位——位于普陀区平利路的移动营业厅。经过40多天居家办公、2天到店静默管理，小姜今天正式复工了。他所在的平利路营业厅也是上海移动在普陀区首家复工复产的营业厅。“一个多月，都是用企业微信接待客户咨询，今天终于能跟客户面对面了。”    营业厅本有9名员工，首批复工为2名男生。静默期间，2人在普陀区科委、甘泉路街道的现场指导下，为营业厅消杀、准备好防疫物资，在门店门口设置隔离区，明确2米线标识；为营业厅设置红、蓝、黄、绿分区标识；对外张贴“场所码”。两人还参加了如何正确穿戴防护服等一系列培训。“之前我只在做小区志愿者时穿过一回大白服，复工后上班时间都得穿大白服，按防疫规定，店内也不能开空调，挑战还是比较大。”    早上9时30分，营业厅迎来复工后第一名消费者。家住曹杨二村的崔先生，手机卡坏了近2个月，听说家附近的营业厅复工了，预约后赶紧前来补卡。办理业务之前，崔先生通过门口的“数字哨兵”刷一下身份证，核酸、体温等信息一目了然。身穿大白服的姜锡磊站在门口接待崔先生，了解需求后帮崔先生把手机、身份证等拿进厅内柜台，交给同事办理。不到10分钟，补卡完成。    姜锡磊介绍，营业厅目前主要受理补卡、停复机、充值缴费、5G手机更换等紧急业务，实施“线上预约、线下受理”模式，降低聚集风险。    记者从上海移动了解到，截至今天，首批复工的17家营业厅均已对外服务。后续将逐步开放线下业务办理，力争到本月底实现30%的营业厅开业服务。本报记者  叶薇    政务服务场所    金山    政务服务场所逐步恢复窗口接待    6月中下旬全面恢复正常    本报讯（记者  屠瑜）今日起，金山区各类政务服务场所分批次逐步有序恢复线下服务。上午9时，吕巷镇、石化街道、高新区等社区事务受理服务中心率先有限恢复线下窗口服务。    按照计划，6月1日前，社区事务受理服务中心开放时间为：周一至周五上午8:30-下午16:30（中午12:00-13:00开展消毒防疫，暂停服务），周六、周日及法定节假日上午8:30-11:30。全员核酸检测日当天暂停服务。考虑到疫情期间积压的办事需求，中心将在原有对外开放服务时间的基础上，根据实际情况提供延时服务。6月中下旬后，所有受理中心全面恢复正常，届时，窗口接待和各类政务服务事项均可受理。    根据安排，面向全社会企业群众提供政务服务的综合场所——金山区行政服务中心，各项线下服务工作也在有序恢复中，计划于5月25日开始有限恢复线下窗口服务。    为有效减少人员聚集，防范疫情风险，对前来大厅办事的，一般要求事先预约，合理安排预约办理时间段、预约办理人员数量，有效控制大厅办事人数。同时，继续安排工作人员及时接收处理线上申请件，及时按期反馈办件审批结果意见。    公园    奉贤    部分公园恢复开放    这样的画面令人倍感振奋    本报讯（记者  李一能）今天上午，奉贤区雕塑公园，已经有不少游人正在散步游玩。“出来透透气，到公园走走放松下心情。”市民倪先生告诉记者，他使用了社区发的出门证，因为家中物资都不缺，就来到公园逛半天再回去。记者从奉贤区绿化管理所获悉，自本月16日奉贤区部分公园重新开放后，截至5月19日，入园总数超过16900人次。    奉贤区绿化管理所所长毛建强今天上午就在公园巡视，他告诉记者，因为天气晴好，加上私家车可以分流出行，所以今天的人流量比前两天多一些。虽然远未恢复到疫情之前的水准，但已经让公园重现生机，这样的画面令人倍感振奋，社会恢复正常的希望就在眼前。    随着奉贤区疫情防控形势总体趋好，市民的生活逐步恢复正常，奉贤区有序推进公园开放，实行“限量、错峰”管理，在切实巩固疫情防疫成果的同时，保障市民游园需求。5月16日起，上海之鱼泡泡公园、年丰公园和古华公园等6座公园已向市民开放，其中公园的室内场馆和游乐设施等暂不开放。    前来游园的市民大多都是利用出门半天的机会，他们觉得居家隔离了这么久，非常需要到公园走走让心情减压。特别是家长们，孩子一直想去公园，随着奉贤区疫情渐渐平息，社会活动逐步恢复，他们就抓紧机会在复工复产之前带孩子去公园逛逛。“平时不觉得带娃逛公园有什么特别，如今觉得非常珍惜，以后会更加热爱生活。”一位家长告诉记者。    毛建强告诉记者，为了确保安全，公园开园前，各座公园全面开展环境清洁消杀，组织全园保洁、整理绿化和恢复重点区域景观。此外，公园管理保障人员核酸检测实施“1+2”，每天必须进行核酸检测，上午、下午各一次抗原检测。    目前，公园严格管控游客人数和安全游园。实行“限量、错峰”管理，瞬时游客规模不得超过公园最大承载量的50%。每个公园入口设置“数字哨兵”和“场所码”，公园入口设置2米线标志，查验48小时核酸阴性证明，并测量体温，合格后方可入园。    菜市场    徐汇    市中心的菜市场回来了    菜品多还便宜，购买欲立马上来    本报讯（记者  张钰芸）“阿姨好，想买点什么？”今天上午10时半，家住徐汇区幽澜苑的钱女士拉着购物车走进长桥菜市场，迎接她的是门口的“电子哨兵”和身穿蓝色防护服的工作人员。时隔一个多月，家门口的菜市场显得熟悉又陌生，那些码放整齐的新鲜蔬菜，带来暌违已久的人间烟火气。    绿油油的宁夏小青菜、本地菠菜，鲜灵灵的大番茄、长豆角，十多种蔬菜被分别打包成一斤左右的小包装，摆放在摊位上供居民选择。还有上海人喜欢的吕四小黄鱼、带鱼、鲳鱼，以及鲜活的淡水鱼虾，禽肉鸡蛋，粮油产品等，品种很丰富。    抬头看一看价目牌，各种生鲜产品的价格非常亲民：一斤多的卷心菜1元1棵，400克的豆角2元一份，本地番茄4.5元一斤，两斤海南香蕉9元，两斤陕西苹果12元……长桥菜市场经理高帅说，居民们在家里足不出户这么久，终于能出门买菜了，不能让价格坏了他们的心情，所以菜场坚持以成本价来销售。    “有的居民说，原本就想出来透透气，没想到菜场里的价格这么便宜，就赶紧多买点。”高经理告诉记者，能够出门买菜的居民都来自周边的无疫小区，进来看到菜品多还便宜，购买欲立马就上来了。不少人一买就是几百块，要给身边不方便出门的邻居带一点。    从3月中旬上海暴发疫情，长桥菜市场的31位工作人员就留守在市场里，已经闭环管理了两个多月。开启线下经营后，他们每天要对市场内的角角落落消杀5次，人员则要完成两次抗原检测和一次核酸检测，同时继续通过线上订单为附近社区提供保供。    除了市中心的菜市场逐步复市，今天上午8时，位于浦东新区的三林市场也开始分区域、分批进行复市经营。目前三林市场复市第一批8名经营户已经入驻市场，度过了两天的静默期后，在今天开市经营。三林市场将严格落实闭环管理，实行无接触式交易模式，进一步提升浦东地区的农产品保供能级。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/5.htm,5/22/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False

,我心目中的沛德先生,,    方卫平    两年前客居剑桥，遇上疫情，原来的各地交流、游走计划多数报废。不过，封锁期间，也正可以蜗居在家里安心读点什么，写点什么。    于是，就细细读完了3大册《束沛德自选集》，包括《耕耘与守望》《坚守与超越》《缘分与担当》，作家出版社2019年9月出版。这是沛德先生历年来出版的近20种文论和散文集中各类文字的精选结集。    最早认识“束沛德”这个名字，是在报刊上。1980年代中期前后，我初入儿童文学领域，那也是新时期儿童文学走出最初的犹豫彷徨，开始进入激情澎湃、艺术放飞的阶段。我常常从有关的文学报道尤其是与儿童文学有关的消息里看到“束沛德”这个名字。看得多了，我发觉，这个名字总是与儿童文学发展的重要决议、部署，与当时儿童文学的某些制度安排、设计以及重要活动联系在一起的。比如1986年5月，中国作协与文化部在烟台联合举办的全国儿童文学创作会议，沛德先生致开幕词；1987年1月，《文艺报》“儿童文学评论”版面世，沛德先生发表了发刊词《窗口·桥梁·苗圃——对〈儿童文学评论〉专版的期望》；1987年启动的中国作协首届全国优秀儿童文学评奖，沛德先生是评委会副主任委员。    1988年10月，在烟台召开的“儿童文学发展趋势研讨会”上，我第一次见到沛德先生。会议上的他，主持发言、驾驭全局举重若轻、游刃有余，会下则亲切随和、广结文缘。他在开幕式上所做的“更贴近大时代  更贴近小读者”的主旨发言，视野和概括，思虑和导引，都令人印象深刻。    1992年11月，中国作协第二届全国优秀儿童文学奖初评工作在北京进行，我作为初选小组成员参与其事。记得初评工作由洪波、发稼先生主持，沛德先生是那一届评委会的主任，初评阶段并无具体工作。我们在外交部招待所关了将近一个月，沛德先生不止一次来看望慰问大家，关心大家的工作和生活安排。    有一天，休息间隙，沛德先生忽然问我：“在北京你想见见谁？”看我一头雾水，他又补充说，“有没有想见的老作家？”我十分意外，“可以吗？”    从事儿童文学及历史研究，我当然希望有机会见见前辈作家。这不仅是一种专业方面的阅历，也可以算是我们与历史之间建立某种联系的方式。说到儿童文学界的老前辈，我最想见的是冰心先生，严文井先生。“我来帮你安排。”沛德先生说。    我当时的意外是显而易见的。我知道，两位先生年事已高，深居简出，虽有沛德先生居中联系，我仍然深感不安。尤其是冰心先生已经92岁高龄，平时我也看到过她老人家接待访客的消息。犹豫之下，也是怕给沛德先生添太多麻烦，我说，“方便的话我想拜见严文井先生”。后来，在沛德先生联系安排下，我约上一起参加初评工作的一位友人，在一个周日的下午，去看望了文井先生。    沛德先生青年时代从复旦大学毕业后就进入了中国作协机关工作，经历过当代文坛的风风雨雨，同时他交友广泛，深谙文坛人事。一位饱经风霜的长者，如此心细如发，虑及一个晚辈内心的愿望。这件事，一直是支撑我个人认识、解读沛德先生人品、文品的一个具体、鲜活的生活细节。    沛德先生曾经多次在私下里和文字中说，他有机会为当代儿童文学的发展摇旗呐喊，但深知自己在儿童文学创作、理论研究上都没有什么建树，占据这个位置很不合适。他十分自谦地表示过：“蜀中无大将，廖化充先锋”，“凭着我对儿童文学的兴趣和热情，也就勉为其难而又心甘情愿地跑起龙套、敲起边鼓来了”。而事实上，从1985年开始，作为作协书记处分管儿童文学组织领导工作的书记凡20余年，他公正、专业、大气、温暖的工作作风和深具开拓精神、有声有色的工作成效，整个儿童文学界是有目共睹的。    沛德先生的一个重要身份，是从1950年代至今，中国儿童文学评论界一直在场的有影响的评论家。由于工作岗位和身份的原因，他的一些文章以会议致辞、总结等形式写成，行文中难免会有一些必须表达的意思和常规用语，因此，我们有时候难免或有“文件体”的挑剔与苛评。但是，阅读沛德先生近70年来写下的大量儿童文学研究和评论文章，我深感他在工作需要和岗位角色的规定下，仍然显露出了作为一位批评家的纯粹的文学心灵和评论眼光。    他写作、发表于1957年的长文《情趣从何而来？——谈谈柯岩的儿童诗》，已经成为那个儿童文学艺术思维稀薄年代留给我们的经典篇章。即使是他后来那些致辞、总结类文章，细细读来，也不乏敏锐独到的观察与思考。如前面提到的1988年烟台“儿童文学发展趋势研讨会”上，他的主旨发言中就特别提出，“考察儿童文学的现状和发展趋势，要把它放到我国全面深化改革、商品经济发展的社会大背景之下。”在我的记忆里，儿童文学界普遍注意到商品经济发展对于儿童文学创作、出版的影响，是上世纪90年代初以后的事情。应该说，沛德先生是较早在儿童文学界提出这一视角和课题的评论家。他陆续发表的《关于儿童文学创新的思考》《谈儿童文学的主旋律及其他》《新景观  大趋势》等文章，都曾在儿童文学界产生了广泛的影响。    2021年12月，在中国作协第十次全国代表大会上，又见沛德先生。90岁高龄的沛德先生是该届大会最年长的代表，媒体对他的关注、采访亦成会议一景。会议期间，我更多的是从报纸、自媒体上与他相遇。我知道，从1953年全国文协（中国作协前身）第二次代表大会担任大会主席团秘书，到后来作为历次大会代表，沛德先生也成为了中国当代文学包括儿童文学的历史见证者，一部“活字典”。而“束沛德”这个名字，是向我们显示了一位文学长辈、一个儿童文学守护者高洁、淡然的人品心性和文学操守。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/7.htm,5/22/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,王熙凤的两次亮相,,    骆玉明    《红楼梦》非常重视写人物的出场。通过这样一个环节，作者把他精心塑造的艺术形象推上舞台，让他们展现出鲜明的个性特征，就像一支乐曲有了特殊的旋律，令人从此无法忘记。    王熙凤是《红楼梦》里特别重要的人物。有人统计过，她的故事在整部小说中所占的篇幅仅次于贾宝玉，而超过林黛玉和薛宝钗。作者也许对自己的这一创造十分满意，他让王熙凤在不同的场合做了两次近似“亮相”的动作，以展现其性格中不同的层面。    第一次是林黛玉初进贾府时。黛玉拜见了外祖母贾老太君，一番激动过去以后，贾母房中恢复了原有的谨重气氛，谁也不敢随便说话。就在这静场之中，一个响亮的声音从后房传进来：“我来迟了，不曾迎接远客！”书中接着用黛玉的反应来说明此事非同寻常，她纳罕：“这些人个个皆敛声屏气，恭肃严整如此，这来者系谁，这样放诞无礼？”    这一情节像京戏中的“叫场”，未见其人，先闻其声。然后才是“亮相”，人物显身。书中对此一层层描写，一层层渲染。    先是“只见一群媳妇丫鬟围拥着一个人，从后房门进来。”这表明来者身份重要。王熙凤是荣国府里管事的人，随时要吩咐下人给她办事，所以身边少不了人。然后总领说一句她的打扮，说是“与众姊妹不同：彩绣辉煌，恍如神妃仙子。”在众星拱月的场面中，烘托出神仙一般的女子。    接着写她的服饰，大概说，就是材料极其昂贵，色彩非常鲜丽，制作十分讲究，艳丽豪华之极。    接着写相貌：一双丹凤三角眼，两弯柳叶吊梢眉。丹凤眼，眼角向上微微翘起，在中国人心目中是特别美的眼型；但略显三角，线条就有点硬，还是美，只是减少了柔媚。柳叶眉，像柳树叶子，弯度不是太大，眉梢细，也是中国人心目中特别美的眉型；吊梢是说眉梢向上飞，那么瞪眼皱眉时会显出凶狠的味道。    接着写身材体态：身量苗条，体格风骚。“身量苗条”容易理解，“体格风骚”就微妙一些。你可以想象这美妙的身体行动时有一种诱惑性的活力散发出来。用现代话语，就是性感。    接着写神态：粉面含春威不露，丹唇未启笑先闻。漂亮的脸蛋很迷人，但有一种威势藏在里面；虽说“不露”，但就是不发作你也能感觉到；可是她又总是试图表达善意，没有说话，你就先听到笑声。露在外面的笑容，藏在里面的凌厉。    这种美丽是具有生命活力的，是具有扩张性的。    可是，贾府规矩森严，在贾母这里，邢夫人、王夫人也都小心谨慎，王熙凤怎敢如此张扬呢？稍微想一下你就会明白：这人是受到贾母宠爱，得到贾母纵容的。    那么她又凭什么在老祖宗这里获得特殊待遇呢？往下看我们就知道了。    只见王熙凤“携着黛玉的手，上下细细的打谅了一回，便仍送至贾母身边坐下”。她把黛玉拉近自己身边，也就一两步路吧，为什么还要“送至贾母身边”呢？这就是体贴入微、周到仔细啊！    然后王熙凤笑道：“天下真有这样标致人物，我今才算见了。况且这通身的气派，竟不像老祖宗的外孙女儿，竟是个嫡亲的孙女。怨不得老祖宗天天口头心头一时不忘。”    这话说得八面玲珑，讨好了所有人。    林黛玉是外孙女，这个“外”使得她成为贾府的外人，但黛玉是按照老太太的意志来贾府的。说黛玉“竟是个嫡亲的孙女”，表明在王熙凤眼里，黛玉具有和贾府三位小姐同样的地位。这当然合贾母心意。    从林黛玉来说，就算她并不认为这是什么荣耀，但从这样的说道里，可以感念到外祖母的慈爱，“琏嫂子”的善意，她不会反感。    贾府三位姑娘会认为：外孙女很优秀了，就会像个孙女，可见孙女毕竟地位高于外孙女，自然也开心。    于是我知道了王熙凤。她是美的，张扬的，也是特别乖巧和聪明伶俐的。    再说第二次“亮相”。那是刘姥姥初入荣国府时，女仆周瑞家的带她去见王熙凤。    进了屋子，只见南窗下是炕，炕上是大红色的毛毡，铺着金色和绿色交织的缎子大坐褥，凤姐儿端端正正坐在那里，衣着随意而无比华丽。    这时王熙凤的大丫鬟平儿站在炕沿边，捧着一个小小的漆器茶盘。盘里放着一个小盖钟。凤姐儿也不接茶，也不抬头，干嘛呢？手内拿着一双小铜筷子在拨手炉内的灰。就是那种烧炭的用来暖手的小铜炉。她只管拨手炉内的灰，就这么慢慢地拨啊拨啊，周围一片安静。    前一次王熙凤人未到，笑声说话声先到，现在却是相反的，好久她也不出声，别人也不敢发声。周边的人物关系不一样，王熙凤的情态也变了。    不过，你要是觉得她故意在刘姥姥面前摆谱显威风，那也不对，一个乡下老太太，值得吗？她就是喜欢这种气氛，在这种威严里面享受到一种愉快。    差不多了，王熙凤才慢慢地问道：“怎么还不请进来？”好像她刚刚没见人进来，这时抬身要茶，才见周瑞家的已带了两个人在地下站着了。于是，脸色一下子变过来，满面春风地问好。    为什么又客套起来？因为她是贵妇人啊，很讲究礼数的。至于变脸，王熙凤说变就变，根本不需要时间。    就是对刘姥姥，凤姐说话的灵巧也是一点都不减。只见她笑道：“亲戚们不大走动，都疏远了。知道的呢，说你们弃厌我们，不肯常来；不知道的那起小人，还只当我们眼里没人似的。”那意思就是说，双方不来往，责任在你们而不在我们。    刘姥姥是作为穷亲戚来“打秋风”的，王熙凤知道总得帮衬一点。但她要事先做好防范。她告诉姥姥，贾府“外头看着这里烈烈轰轰的，殊不知大有大的艰难去处。”这意思是咱们也不好过。    然后话锋一转：“今儿你既老远的来了，又是头一次见我张口，怎好叫你空回去的。”这话里的意思，你第一次向我开口，总不能让你空手而返，第二次可就未必了。    到底能够帮多少呢？王熙凤说她的丫鬟做衣裳的二十两银子还没动，“我还没动呢，你们不嫌少，就暂且拿了去罢”。这是说咱们也没有多余的钱，不得已，只好先拆了东墙补你的西墙罢了。    第二次“亮相”，我们看到王熙凤性格中另一层重要的成分：喜欢弄权，喜欢看人在自己的威压下面紧张不安的样子。她说话仍然灵巧，但对刘姥姥这样的穷亲戚，这种灵巧的价值，更多具有自我欣赏的意味。    有过这么两次“亮相”，王熙凤个性与品格的基调，已经非常清晰地留在我们脑海中了，不会与其他任何人相混。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-22/8.htm,5/22/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

各重点商场、超市、专卖店有序筹备复商复市,南西商圈更多商户加入保供队伍,,    南京西路商圈正蓄势待发，各重点商场、超市、专卖店正有条不紊地进行复商复市的各项准备，沿线绿化、灯光一如往常，正在为恢复往日活力而努力。    今天上午，记者在兴业太古汇北门1楼取餐点看到，“数字哨兵”已经就位，外卖小哥需要通过验证和测温，扫“场所码”，并以无接触方式取餐，在餐食交给外卖小哥前，工作人员已对外包装进行了消杀。    兴业太古汇两座办公楼，也已配置了手持“数字哨兵”，进入楼宇后，扫描随申码即可显示核酸、体温等信息。    商场里，工作人员正用喷雾枪和沾有消毒液的抹布对电梯扶手和栏杆进行擦拭消毒，还有穿戴防护服和面屏的工作人员背着消毒弥雾机开展消杀。记者观察到，各商铺也张贴了“场所码”，开放后市民进入商场和商铺可精准溯源。    南京西路商圈是上海最早布设“数字哨兵”的商圈之一。早在今年1月，静安区商务委就协调引导南京西路重点商场配备具有验码测温功能的一体机，以恒隆广场、兴业太古汇、久光百货、静安嘉里中心等为代表的10家重点商场合计安装“数字哨兵”近50台。    据了解，目前南京西路商圈沿街商铺、车辆出入口均安装了“场所码”或“数字哨兵”，实现了商场、超市、沿街商铺百分百覆盖。为了加快复商复市，前期布设的“数字哨兵”已通过远程升级，实现了核酸报告查验等功能。    南京西路商圈还在推动更多商户加入保供队伍。据了解，封控以来，静安嘉里中心Ole超市、上海商城城市超市、静安九百食品城、西区老大房等一直参与保供工作。兴业太古汇、芮欧百货、梅龙镇广场、晶品、1788广场、丰盛里的多家餐饮企业在落实疫情防控措施、严格闭环管理的前提下，也陆续加入进来。    比如，嘉里中心Ole超市自封控以来，通过社区集单、线上订单的方式，服务周边3-5公里居民，日均订单150单。兴业太古汇的city’super超·生活已于5月17日起恢复外卖渠道，向周边居民提供蔬菜、水果、海鲜肉类、水酒零食等物资保障服务。员工将外卖订单打包好后，沿运货专用路线，送至北广场设置的外卖取餐区域，由工作人员进行消杀后，再交由外卖员送至消费者手上，确保全程无接触配送。兴业太古汇还在协调、帮助更多租户早日开工，主要包括商超、餐饮业态。    为迎接复工复产，各大商场也升级了环境消杀等防疫措施，严格按照《大型商场预防性消毒技术要点》等相关文件要求，做好场所预防性消毒工作。在恒隆广场，工作人员每天多频次对商场及办公楼的公共区域进行消毒打扫，商场内的商铺陆续开始准备货源，并对货品做好消杀，确保以最佳状态迎接顾客。    兴业太古汇驻场闭环团队每天对商场、办公楼的各公共区域进行整体环境保洁和全方位消杀，全面检查地下车库、设备房、空调、灯光、消防设备等基础保障设施，同时做好空调新风设备过滤器的清洁和更换。    本报记者  郜阳  潘高峰  通讯员  黄小清,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/3.htm,5/23/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,处方量同比增长超10倍,上海100多家互联网医院助力患者就诊配药,    提供跨院复诊、医保全覆盖、推出取药码和互联网取药专窗、开设周日线上义诊服务……本轮疫情发生以来，上海各家医院采取多项措施，加快推进互联网医院的建设发展，努力解决复诊患者就医难、配药难等问题。目前，全市已有100余家互联网医院，其中89家公立互联网医院可提供跨院复诊和配药服务。为期一个多月的周日互联网医院线上义诊活动正在市级医疗机构开展，吸引了不少患者慕名上网挂号求诊。    仁济医院    打出“诊疗+科普”组合拳    昨天，仁济医院互联网医院的主题义诊为近千人次患者提供就诊咨询、配药到家和术后随访等服务。首场重点学科群系列主题义诊围绕泌尿系统问题，由仁济医院副院长、泌尿科主任薛蔚和核医学科主任刘建军领衔，45位仁济医院的泌尿科、核医学科专家与患者相聚“云端”，依托“仁济医院互联网医院”平台，向广大患者提供线上诊疗服务的同时，还科普各类泌尿系统常见肿瘤早期筛查的必要性，提高肿瘤患者规律复查及自我管理的意识。    家住闵行区浦江镇的患者陶先生（化名）患有前列腺增生已有数年，排尿困难、夜尿增多的症状让他苦不堪言，薛蔚在详细解释前列腺增生的常见症状和诊疗思路后，参照陶先生既往的各项检验检查，对症下药的同时，建议陶先生每年定期复查前列腺磁共振，一套权威精准的“组合拳”让陶先生直呼“心里踏实很多，多亏义诊解决燃眉之急”。    据院方介绍，除了重点学科群系列主题义诊，仁济医院互联网医院原周日常规排班的风湿科、血液科、肿瘤科、乳腺外科和心理医学科等各学科医生也提供在线义诊。    同济医院    “云发药”最快只要10分钟    上海市同济医院联手普陀区多家单位启动了“普陀区疫情防控互联网医药配送志愿服务2.0项目”。医院党委书记许树长介绍，通过“药骑士”的送药，市民可以足不出户解决基本配药问题。接过市民药袋子，“药骑士”们出发了。当天的订单送至普陀区甘泉路街道、宜川路街道、真如镇街道、石泉路街道以及宝山区的大场镇、静安区的彭浦镇等多地。最快10分钟后，家住在志丹路某小区的谭先生已经收到了药品。    上海市同济医院互联网医院还开通了在线药物“云咨询”服务。截至目前，已接受各类咨询1100余次。一名肺癌术后患者服用厄洛替尼片1个多月，出现了恶心呕吐，他通过互联网医院向药师询问，是否可以服用家里现有的奥美拉唑胶囊缓解症状。药师根据患者的描述，排除了因肿瘤导致的恶心呕吐，初步判断是厄洛替尼片引起的药物不良反应，需要服用止吐药减轻症状。同时，嘱咐患者不能同时服用这两个药，因奥美拉唑会升高胃的PH值，降低厄洛替尼片的药效，即使间隔给药可能也无法消除药物相互作用。根据经验，药师向患者推荐了昂丹司琼片、甲氧氯普胺片止吐药，并叮嘱患者要坚持服用抗肿瘤药，如有不适就要及时来院复诊，千万不要自行停药。    五官科医院    接诊跨院复诊患者近200例    5月9日起，复旦大学附属眼耳鼻喉科医院（上海市五官科医院）互联网医院率先开通“跨院复诊服务”，成为全市首家支持跨院复诊配药服务的医疗机构。只要6个月内在本市医疗机构有就诊记录和用药记录的五官科相关疾病的患者，都可使用跨院复诊和配药服务。院长周行涛说，2周以来，已经接诊跨院复诊患者近200例，开具线上处方近百张。该院互联网医院还首创了“取药码”。扫一扫码，无需进入门诊大厅，无需就诊卡，也无需展示核酸阴性证明，就可以在线下互联网医院取药专窗取药。    今年4月20日起，该院互联网医院还开创了“院长365热线”，满足肿瘤、手术和疑难病患者的会诊、入院、随访等需求，24小时内会有专业学科组进行对接。该热线开通以来接到在线咨询近2000人次，安排紧急住院手术30例，门诊手术7例，为其他寻求就医帮助的患者分别提供互联网就医、在线咨询、预约线下门诊就医等服务，畅通线上线下疑难杂症诊治的绿色通道。    该院门急诊办公室/互联网医院办公室主任谢诗蓉说，互联网医院医保相关政策也在优化。为解决“一老一小”就医配药问题，该院互联网医院率先完成上海市医保全覆盖，依托本市“随申码”亲属码模式，实现“一老一小”亲属码绑码医保结算。    岳阳医院    25个临床科室专家线上义诊    昨天上午，岳阳医院“中西合璧，护佑健康”周日互联网义诊线上举行。医院的呼吸内科、心内科、神经内科、肝病科、肿瘤科、皮肤科、妇科、儿科、传统医学科等25个临床科室的专家共接待了近500位市民朋友的疾病问诊和健康咨询。    家住普陀区的小李是慢性荨麻疹患者，看到医院义诊的消息后，立即通过网络预约了岳阳医院皮肤科义诊。“医生，我患这个病好久了，去过很多医院，症状是有改善，但吃完药后感觉浑身发冷症状明显，胃也不舒服……”在云端接待小李咨询的是皮肤科李欣主任。“好的，你的情况我基本了解了，现在让我看看你的舌苔。”问诊后，李欣辨证患者属脾肾阳虚型，查阅了外院之前开具的中药处方，结合患者的情况，李欣为他调整了方子，建议他可以在家附近的医院，或岳阳医院门诊或互联网门诊配药。同时，还指导了小李的饮食宜忌和日常生活中与疾病相关的一些注意事项。仅昨天上午，李欣就接待了近30名皮肤病患者的咨询。    健康云    “我要配药”专区开方24万张    疫情发生以来，互联网医院以其专业性和便利性，被越来越多的上海市民认可。市卫健委副主任赵丹丹介绍，4月1日以来，上海市互联网医院业务诊疗量明显增加，处方量是去年同期的10多倍。通过互联网医院分流了百姓看病配药需求，缓解了医院救治压力，减少人员集聚，降低交叉感染风险。    除了各大医疗机构的互联网医院，依托长三角（上海）智慧互联网医院，健康云平台也在疫情期间快速开设“我要配药”服务专区，“一键续方”“复诊配药”“在线咨询”三大便民功能均受到市民的好评。健康云的最新统计数据显示，4月中旬开通以来，“我要配药”专区招募了本市公立医疗机构的600多名医师和药师，累计提供线上预约与咨询服务大概59.7万人次，开具处方24.1万张，药品送达19.5万单，最初每天开具处方其实只有200余张，药品配送200余单，增加到现在最高一天可以开具处方11000张，药品配送达到8000余单。    本报记者  左妍  郜阳,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/4.htm,5/23/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,慢慢敲门，是他们的约定,,    “我每天都要看望几次老伯伯，不放心他。”一手拿着血压仪，一手端着刚烧好的菜，李海燕一口气爬上五楼。来到一户人家门前，她轻缓地敲了敲门，“慢慢敲门，因为老伯伯眼睛看不出，急了要摔跤的”。    李海燕是嘉定区外冈镇杏花社区的一位志愿者。3月13日，杏花社区开始封控，热心肠的她主动报名帮忙。4月1日，李海燕的志愿者岗位从道口出入登记换到了社区工作，从这一天起，她就与失明老伯伯结下了缘。    “志愿者们都做了分工，我负责的区域正好有一位独居失明老人，我一开始还不知道。”有一天，李海燕发抗原试剂，敲了好一会儿门才开，这才发现，原来老伯伯眼睛看不见。李海燕慢慢了解到，原来老伯伯的儿子隔离在浦东，护工也被封控无法前来照顾，这些日子，老人便独自居住。不愿意麻烦别人的他，平时吃得也很简单，就自己摸索着下点面条、煮点稀饭。    “居委发过菜，老伯伯可能送给了邻居，我看他冰箱空落落的，当时就很心酸，那天晚上回来都没睡着。这件事如果我不知道也罢了，知道了换作任何人都不忍心这样。”从此，李海燕就对老伯伯上了心，时不时帮他做饭，打扫卫生。“我说，老伯伯你想吃什么都跟我讲，我不能保证100%能弄到，但我尽量都给你买来。”    老人的自强也感动了她。“我们如果闭着眼睛，会觉得什么也做不了，但老伯伯能靠手感摸索。”有一次，李海燕上门时，见老人正烧开水，吓了一跳，急急地说当心烫伤。老人却笑笑说，没事的。    在李海燕眼中，老伯伯彬彬有礼，十分客气。可能是担心麻烦别人，一开始李海燕要帮老人采买物资，他也只说需要咸蛋、皮蛋，完全不提菜肉。后来，李海燕为他团了蔬菜，买了点心，这才慢慢了解到，老人喜欢吃茄子、土豆、辣椒。“时间长了会讲给我听，一开始他不说。”过两天，李海燕烧了一碗红烧肉，见老伯伯吃得有滋有味，她心中也乐开了花。    做志愿者并不轻松。李海燕常常忙着发放抗原、楼道消杀等；最近，经过培训考核后，她还掌握了核酸采样技能。但尽管忙碌，李海燕每天都会抽空去看看老伯。老人虽然看不见，但耳朵灵敏。有一回李海燕为他打扫马桶，老人急忙阻止说，臭。李海燕则坦然道：“没关系，谁家没有父母？我在家里也一样要做的。”    李海燕说，社区居委都知道老伯伯独居，之前也隔三差五去看看他，如今李海燕把这份工作揽了下来。“他们要做核酸检测、发物资，忙不过来；我说没事，有我在你们放心，老人我肯定会照顾好的。”    本报记者  杨洁,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/5.htm,5/23/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
抑郁女子遭遇“神秘来电”背上巨债变得更焦虑,2小时被骗62.9万元　警方已立案调查,,    在昨天的新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，家住浦东新区花木路718弄的市民朱先生向“新民帮侬忙”反映，疫情封控中，由于妻子的抑郁焦虑不断加重，竟让人乘虚而入、趁“疫”打劫，短短2小时被骗走62.9万元。    “神秘来电”设连环套    在电话连线中朱先生表示，5月12日下午，妻子李女士接到了所谓“京东金融平台”工作人员的“神秘来电”。此人自称姓陆，一开口“你摊上大事了”“后果很严重”等话语，如“连珠炮”似的轰向了妻子。    对方称，京东金融向第三方平台开放了接口，但有不法分子正冒用李女士的账户贷款，京东已发现了类似大量的案例，后续会给“受害者”带来诸如还款滞纳金、征信受影响，甚至有人上门催收等严重后果。    李女士本就患有抑郁症和焦虑症，而小区封控后，病情不断加重，一听此话顿时六神无主、极度忧虑，一步步茫然不知所措地钻进了对方预先设下的“连环套”。    被洗脑后贷款、转账    对方先是把李女士拉进了“腾讯会议”，在一番“车轮大战”的洗脑下，竟忽悠她连续向四家互联网金融平台分多次借款共计62.9万元。之后，又鬼使神差般地将打入自己账户的贷款，分5笔汇入了对方提供的所谓“安全账户”。记者从朱先生发来的截屏中看到，这5个账户根本不是什么“对公账户”，而是分别名为林晓鹏、柳云华、陈清华、侯运豪、莫荣祥的私人户头。    而在几家互联网金融平台中，李女士向深圳前海微众银行股份有限公司的贷款12.4万元，借款年利率（单利）达18.25%。面对巨额负债、高额利息，本就收入不高，且面临失业的朱先生和李女士更加不堪重负，几天时间，李女士的病情更是急剧恶化，整天不是浑浑噩噩，就是以泪洗面。    事发后，朱先生立即向上海市公安局浦东分局花木派出所报案，目前警方已立案调查。    应牢牢绷紧安全弦    对此，业内人士指出，疫情封控期间，在无法面对面的“线上沟通”和“网来网去”中，市民更应小心谨慎，牢牢绷紧安全这根弦，及时下载“国家反诈中心”小程序，遇到不明来电和涉及转账等信息，必须第一时间挂断电话，通过正规途径核实了解。同时，也希望执法部门加强侦破和打击力度，让诈骗者尽数落网，切实维护市民的财产安全。    本报记者  王军    战疫·帮侬忙诉求数报    5月22日11时至5月23日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求182件，其中紧急类诉求109件，已推动解决87件（含“公益联盟”12件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/6.htm,5/23/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,病毒启示,,    虹影    2020年因为我的中国签证过期，申请延期未成，我只能回到英国，先是在女儿住宿的学校外租了房，住了一段日子，其中包括自行隔离时间，之后便接女儿出来吃她想念的中国饭。后又住到朋友家一段日子，最后租到好几个朋友和家人所在的兰巴斯地区的一套房，搬到此地，正是伦敦全面隔离开始，中国使馆开门，无法办理签证，我们遵守规定，没有见人。女儿学校也关门，去车站接她回来。就三人相处。好在这套房子有一个大露台，楼下马路边有三个大食品超市，又在地铁边，有珂拉珀姆公地，过马路就是。    救护车尖叫声，甚至在夜里，都有。超市门前排长队抢食品的人，我在窗前可以看到。看到人少时，我冲下楼去购买食品。因为是租的房子，只有一个书桌，给女儿用，餐桌给先生用，我想购一个书桌，可是家具店关门，发现熨烫衣板可以当书桌时，我放在窗前。我写作，看救护车经过，看隔开两米排队的人戴口罩，一天比一天多。每天我们一家人都去公园走八公里。公园里的人，都是出来透风锻炼身体的，经常看到孩子们坐在阳光下，手捧一本书在看，也有警车在边上巡逻，看有无一群人坐在一起，不按规定隔开两米。    每天过相同的生活，除了准备一日三餐，就是写作，读书，走路，晚上看电影，我透过时间看自己。    窗外间隔一段时间有救护车的尖叫，深夜和清晨都没有停止。这场病毒对每个人都是考验，死神追击人类。单纯谈论国家与国家、民族与民族、个人与集体的冲突与矛盾，无论你的立场是什么，如果不认清人类所犯的错误使大自然病入膏肓，这病毒就是大自然直接的惩罚，我们人类永远无法前进。    这病毒看来没有那么轻易退场，将持续下去，多久，不能预知。但有一点可以看到，我们的生活结构因之改变，人独处，或是以家为单位结成的小群体，与外界保持距离，一切依靠网络，交流并购买食物，而生存。    我们住在兰巴斯四十二天。之后，我们搬到北伦敦。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/7.htm,5/23/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,苏河之美,,    王妙瑞    我对苏州河有一种特别的情感，曾在曹杨路桥的河畔居住了10年；上班也在此河两岸，30年里工作几经调动，一直没有离开过苏州河，退休时挥挥手告别了恒丰路桥下的一号大楼。在南苏州路325号百联集团培训中心办公时，我每天开窗看望苏州河，从民船的桨声灯影消失，到专业船只治理河道，挖淤泥、充氧气，打捞水葫芦和重建防汛墙等，我目睹黑臭的河水逐渐变清。逢端午节苏州河开始赛龙舟了，盛大的集体婚庆仪式也选择在河里搭台举行，90多岁老人不信臭河浜有此等喜事，拄拐走出家门看热闹来了。    苏州河是美丽太湖孕育的女儿天生丽质，是从江南水乡走来的“俏女子”。过去那段不堪回首的黑臭岁月，是她奉献得太多。后来政府花了几百亿的代价为她“整容”，我觉得值，因为她是我们上海人的母亲河。今天苏州河上最漂亮的一座桥，就是本来破旧狭窄的武宁路桥，重建以后巨大桥柱上金色的“母与子”雕塑，象征着苏州河与我们上海人的那层“血缘”关系。    我喜欢骑共享单车去看苏州河，一来方便二来自由。42公里长的河要分段分时游览，才能品出韵味来。从外环线的临空一号公园起到外白渡桥，黄浦、虹口、静安、普陀、长宁区段全线贯通。    6.3公里静安段太像天然T台了，沿岸的“摩登花街”别开生面，还有漂亮的“金色大道”，以银杏为主干树种构建，与绿莹莹的河水交相辉映，精心打造的苏河岸边，倾注了让母亲河出彩之情。从河南路桥下骑车经过时我眼前一亮，下车推行细看，原来这里是别出心裁的时光长廊，精美画作展示了1921至2021的静安生活场景与城市风貌。当年我在虎丘路88号上班，有七八年时间骑车穿过桥下。我怎么也没想到阴暗逼仄的空间可以改造得如此精致，大概是专门为母亲河装修的“后厢房”吧。    黄浦段的“苏河之眸”是水汪汪的“长睫大眼”，那是改造一新的见水亲水平台，3公里长的八成河岸可体验沉浸式的滨水城市生活场景。我尤其喜欢“外滩源”的圆明园路，改造后典雅得像一条名贵檀香手串。而长宁段沿河的滑板公园、风铃绿地、虹桥河浜休闲公园、中山公园、华政公共开放空间等10个绿色板块，如从空中俯瞰绝对是为苏河个性化定制的一串“绿珍珠项链”。    北苏州路的虹口段，冒出了一个崭新的宝丽嘉酒店，河岸边专设桌椅供休憩观景。我在暖阳下悠闲地坐着喝咖啡，熟悉的老地方转身为新潮天地了。想当年上海大厦不惜花巨资改造窗户，就是害怕苏州河臭气窜进客房啊。走上原停车场改建的“最上海的观景平台”，远眺陆家嘴天际线无敌美景，令我感慨万千，好像有一款精美绝伦的“凤冠”映入眼帘，恰好“戴”在了苏州河的头上。40年前我每天骑车过乍浦路桥去上班，对面浦东陆家嘴仅有一根孤独的航船信号杆可见。    最精彩的是在苏河十八湾，她太像京剧戏装里的水袖，就那么轻轻一甩，抖出了飘逸和优美，婀娜多姿迷倒了多少人。当然苏州河也有打扮入时的新装。21公里的普陀段像“大长腿”，11.2公里的长宁段好像脚上的摩登“靴子”，踏上大渡河桥旁的游艇码头足够亮丽。夜色中的母亲河流光溢彩，疑似银河落申城。30多座桥梁像琴键一样横卧在苏河上，五光十色的车子川流不息驶过，弹奏出新时代的人民城市心曲。    苏河之美，我所向往。    期待如常生活的到来。晚风中我是那个骑行畅游不想回家的人。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-23/8.htm,5/23/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

外高桥造船一天完成三大生产节点,三大船企全面实现复工复产,,    本报讯（记者  叶薇  通讯员  何宝新  严鹏）复工复产仅一周，造船即入快节奏。昨天，中国船舶集团有限公司旗下上海外高桥造船有限公司完成一船交付、两船出坞三大生产节点，驶入“快车道”。至此，中国船舶集团旗下的上海三大船企：江南造船（集团）有限责任公司、沪东中华造船（集团）有限公司和外高桥造船全面实现复工复产，且经营生产势头喜人，交船、接单、开工、下坞、出坞、试航等一个都没落下，上海船舶工业重又回归机器轰鸣、焊花飞溅的繁忙景象。    昨天交付离厂的是一艘液化天然气（LNG）双燃料动力、20.9万载重吨纽卡斯尔型散货船“诺瓦特拉山”号。同日出坞的是一艘21万载重吨纽卡斯尔型散货船、一艘LNG双燃料动力11.9万载重吨阿芙拉型原油轮。    “诺瓦特拉山”号轮是由外高桥造船自主研发设计的新一代具有自主知识产权的双燃料动力船型。该船型长299.50米，型宽50米，型深25.20米，设计吃水18.40米，设计吃水航速14节，入级美国船级社。该船采用LNG燃料和传统燃料柴油驱动，可一次性满足完成中国至澳大利亚航线两个来回或者中国至巴西航线一个来回。    受疫情影响，“诺瓦特拉山”号轮原定于3月末试航的计划被迫延迟。在中国船舶集团周密协调和上海市经信委、浦东新区科经委、高东镇政府等大力支持下，在全面落实防疫措施的前提下，该船于5月4日开启试航。经过项目组、船东、船检和相关服务商的精心策划、充分准备，首次将燃油、燃气试航合二为一，并较计划提前一天圆满完成所有试验项目，为最终的交船赢得宝贵的时间。    当日出坞的21万载重吨纽卡斯尔型散货船实现了全船主体结构完工交验，机舱打磨油漆结束，机舱管路及甲板管系大部分交验完成。11.9万载重吨阿芙拉型原油轮则实现了多个货油舱和管路系统的交付，机舱也达到打磨油漆状态。同时，还完成了坞内另外两艘半船起浮移位作业。    值得一提的是，原先为外高桥造船提供船舶出坞及半船起浮协作服务的某专业船务公司，由于疫情原因，无法到厂开展作业。为了确保按时完成出坞计划，外高桥造船立足自身力量，成立出坞专项工作组，研判出坞作业难点、排查风险隐患、沙盘模拟出坞全流程、在作业现场实操演练、多轮次安全检查，同时以视频远程的方式，与船务公司一同研究制定完善出坞、移位方案和应急预案，确保了作业万无一失。    自5月16日启动复工复产以来，外高桥造船加速推进产能和供应链的恢复。目前，大型邮轮、海上浮式生产储油装置（FPSO）等重点工程项目也相继启动。本周内外高桥造船还将完成2艘7000箱集装箱船、1艘11.4万吨阿芙拉型成品油轮开工，2艘19万吨好望角型散货船下坞共计5个生产大节点，复工复产将进入提速扩面新阶段。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/3.htm,5/24/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,更多人脸上露出了笑容,虹桥火车站外“爱心接力”此起彼伏，滞留者被“分类安置”,    “我要把这张照片，发回老家，让家里人看看上海人的爱心！”    昨天下午，即将离开上海返回阜阳的凡春平，在虹桥火车站外，意外拿到了由上海市劳模协会送出的爱心盒饭。饥肠辘辘的她，却没有马上打开盒饭，而是掏出手机拍了一张照片发给家人。    凡春平笑着说：“上海人真是太好了！”    她不知道的是，递给她盒饭的人，是全国劳模包起帆（见右图）。在短短一个小时内，包起帆和其他劳模一共送出了400份盒饭。包起帆说：“上海是全国的上海。各地的人聚集在这里，把上海建设起来。今天，我们在这里为返乡者送上盒饭。等到上海疫情好了以后，欢迎他们回来，我们是一家人。”    这两天，在虹桥火车站外，“谢谢你们来过上海”的爱心接力，此起彼伏。    市慈善基金会长宁区代表处的志愿者队伍，在现场发放由光明集团等企业配送的矿泉水、方便面等。此外，他们还开着援助车，给不少筋疲力尽的人，提供帮助。    从昨天的情况来看，送给虹桥火车站外滞留者的物资，比较充足。滞留者可以在多个爱心摊点，免费拿到物资。现场有消毒车不断消毒，有工作人员提醒避免聚集，有清洁人员及时打扫。    目前，虹桥管委会对滞留者进行“分类安置”。有票、有核酸阴性报告的人员，被妥善安置于停车场安置点。有票、没有核酸报告的人员，可以在现场直接做核酸检测。而无票、无核酸报告的人员，则由街道安排到附近安置点，保障基本生活。这两天，居住在绿化带中的滞留者，比前几天大大减少。而且，由于轨道交通和部分公交线路的开通，长时间步行或骑共享单车抵达机场的人员，少了许多。    相比前几天，更多滞留者脸上，露出了笑容。本报记者  晏秋秋  孙中钦,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/4.htm,5/24/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False

丈夫瘫痪，儿子患克罗恩病，70岁顾阿姨自己的化疗药又断了……,公益联盟药和“口粮”全都有  癌症阿姨又能照顾父子俩了,,    求助    我今年70岁，患有乳腺癌，一直要服用化疗药物“依西美坦片”控制病情。但由于小区封控，再加之平时就诊的上海交通大学医学院附属第九人民医院黄浦分院暂无此药，目前已断药两天。我丈夫瘫痪在床，儿子身体也一直不好，家里就靠我一人照料。没有了药，万一病情复发撑不住了，那他们可怎么办啊？！    黄浦区北京西路240弄  顾阿姨    帮忙>>>    家人重病缠身    担忧自己无法照顾    在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，记者电话连线了解到，顾阿姨的丈夫是“渐冻人”，长期瘫痪在床，伴有糖尿病、高血压等多种基础疾病，今年还因脑梗住院。儿子身体一直不好，这5年来又患上克罗恩病。作为家里的顶梁柱，重病缠身的顾阿姨一直坚强支撑着，家人尤其儿子是她生命中的希望。    “孩子虽然有病，但他真的很优秀，书画作品一直获奖，还曾被送到国外展出。尽管他身体一直不太好，但我愿意用余生去照顾他、‘修复’他、守护他。”突然间自己断药，让顾阿姨极度无助：“我从来都不说家里的困难，总觉得能自己挺就挺过去。但现在是真的没办法了，如果我不吃药，病情就会恶化，万一……后面的事，我真是想都不敢想！”    “保命药”来了    生活物资一并送到    “阿拉一定要帮帮顾阿姨！”居委会志愿者和“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟小伙伴一同迅速开启全城搜索模式，终于为顾阿姨找到了急需的“保命药”。    对于所有人给予自己和家人的关爱，顾阿姨在电话中表达了深深的感激，说到动情之处，不禁连声抽泣：“在我最艰难的时候，很多人的无私相助，给了我支撑下去的力量。尤其是上海市残联、黄浦区残联、南京东路街道、居委会社工，你们帮我照顾丈夫，不辞辛苦为儿子配来药物，是你们让我有了最坚强的依靠。”    “顾阿姨，侬还有啥需要帮忙的吗？”在记者一再询问下，“不愿麻烦别人”的顾阿姨好不容易挤出了一两句话：“现在丈夫和儿子缺的就是营养，我又不会网购。能不能帮我买点牛奶、鸡蛋和肉，最好能有白萝卜，至少我可以帮儿子炖炖鱼汤。要多少钞票，我自己付！”记者连声承诺：“阿姨，侬放心，阿拉一定帮侬送！”随后，又是在一番全城搜索后，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟的小伙伴将紧缺的生活物资，送达了顾阿姨所住的小区。  本报记者  王军    战疫·帮侬忙  诉求数报    5月23日11时至5月24日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求177件，其中紧急类诉求110件，已推动解决88件（含“公益联盟”13件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/6.htm,5/24/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,童话小事,,    梅子涵    我是一直读安徒生童话的，它是我的常年书，最好的中文版放在桌上，好几十年近在咫尺。绿颜色封面，薄薄的十六本叠成一个很无限的高度，这个高度并不是眼睛看得出的，而是经常翻翻读读间，在心里渐渐走出、量出的。    的确是几十年了。那是我上大学一年级时，住在郊区的子明在镇上的书店买到的。那时，这一套书刚出版，它和其他一些大经典文学的出版一样，都是对一个新的文化时代的庆祝和欢呼，半夜三更在书店门口排着长队，第二天开了店门欣喜若狂奔进去买。漫无目标地度过了乱荒的十年，没有书读，语句已生硬，都非常想念文学想念童话了。    那个夜晚，住在对面寝室的子明，走过来轻声问我：“安徒生童话你要吗？”我说：“要！”他说：“下个星期我带给你。我是在镇上书店买到的，没有几套，我认识经理。”    从第二个星期开始，每个星期日晚上返校，他就带一本给我。一共十六本，他几乎带了十六个星期。最后一本是《幸运的贝儿》，拿到最后一本的时候，我心里也有些像幸运的贝儿，终于全了，放心了。    价钱是六块五毛六。那时的钞票真是贵重也很有尊严。    我数着钱付给他的时候，他又说：“很难买的，我认识经理！”    我谢谢他的时候，他说：“我知道你会喜欢！”    他买下了又卖给了我，他也一本本读了，读完一本给我一本，我一本一本得到，方式很奇特。我是带薪上学的，他是学校发补贴。我的工资是33元。农场知青考取大学可以带薪。    《幸运的贝儿》第一段写一幢漂亮的房子，主人非常富有，他可以在客厅里摆出两桶金子，也可以在房间门口放一桶金币，作为他儿子将来的储蓄。    这一套童话从此成为我生活里的金子、金币，放在桌上。    绿封面上印着安徒生的名字，也印着叶君健的名字。他们是我桌上每天都在的两个名字，几十年近在咫尺，天天看见，一个灿烂，一个耀眼。    用安徒生般的文笔来写，可以是这样：“从前有一个会写字的人，他的桌上除了笔和纸，还有两个人的名字。这两个名字印在一本书上，一个在前，一个在后。至于这个人自己的名字当然是写在他自己的书上，这个道理，从他没有开始写书时就已经知道，这是一个可以让人光荣的道理。不过他的书永远不可能比这一本伟大，可他还是努力写，因为至少他可以把它们放在伟大的书旁边，放在伟大的书旁边，会被光芒照到。他会喜悦地对人说：‘我的书上有光芒！’即使没有人愿意读他的书，他也会对自己说。这样说说，也是活着的意义。活着总得有个意义。”    在中国，叶君健的名字是和安徒生的名字最搭的，他把安徒生的童话译得太像安徒生写的，丹麦也是这么认为，为他颁发了奖。就如同巴尔扎克的小说在中国，他的名字旁边必须出现傅雷，如果不是这样，那么连翻开阅读的热情也会低落。    文学翻译家，是让你读懂另一种语言的文学的人。如果正好他又很杰出，那就不只是转述出大概的故事、意思，两种语言，被他牵牢在一根缰绳上，前后左右都在手中，上马是全景，下马在细节，原本的那个文学是个完美艺术，他牵了走必定处处风光。领略不尽，所以流连不离。缭绕成你心空晴朗的一块，或是淋湿了你，说不清究竟是因为那个原文字的写成人，还是现文字的这个译成者，反正你的确是读着走着在你认识的文字里。    从前的人都是用笔写的，那支笔也是他们各自的缰绳，牵着心里的大马，朝着一个方向，安徒生和巴尔扎克都是用鹅毛笔。    巴尔扎克的小说叠在一起太厚了，安徒生的童话不厚却叠成无限高。读着它们不是为了找到发财指南、写作秘诀，现实也好，浪漫也好，都是为了人的眼睛、心里……人是活在平常人间的，文学把平常人间写成枝头站立，写成更高的空中漫步，能和它近在咫尺，顺手捧起，放下在身边，说不上究竟会有多少意义，至少会有宁静，诗性向往，和度过的光阴愿意相处和气，不是总怒火冲天，更不干出恶事……这都不属于文艺学里的描述，我现在也不是在上文艺学的课。    《海的女儿》也是写给人的眼睛和心里的。给想成为人的人。它是一篇长诗般的童话，叶君健译成了童话长诗。深海中的小鱼觉得人高贵，想成为一个人，寻一条实现之途，结果却落得命也难保。活着的法则在无数的人那儿就是活着，可是小鱼却断然拒绝为了活着而让另一个生命死去。她扔弃刀子，自甘化为泡沫。她难道真的成为泡沫了吗？她分明成了真正的人！她在哪儿呢？请往长着双腿的无数人群望去，那些活出了人格的都是她！这样的人一直不很多的，所以还需要很久的进化。近在咫尺地放着、读着，正有进化的意义。    安徒生的铜像我是倚靠着站过的。巴尔扎克的家我也到过，见过那张小书桌。站在同学家的窗口看见过傅雷先生家的窗口。那都是瞻仰。但是叶君健先生我是真见过，两次都在海边，参加相同的会。    第一回那次，我走在路上，猛然看见前面走着他。我不好意思超过，放慢脚步。我是想找个文具店买本子，他也在找文具店，走了蛮不近的路才找到，就先后走了进去。    他问店员有没有圆珠笔的笔芯。他买了一支，好像是一毛钱吧？然后他就离开了。    几年后，在另外一个海边，和他合影，我对他说起上一次的行走，说起他买一毛钱的笔芯。他说：“那个文具店还不近，走了好久。”    我还说起了那套绿封面书。他说：“是一九七八年出版的。”    我说：“我每天都放在桌上。”    他高高个子，智慧十足，眼神清高，笑容却温和，帅得十分少见！现在想想，也还是瞻仰。    安徒生年少时站在家乡河边练歌喉，有人告诉他，东方有个古老国家，那儿有个很漂亮的王子，一定听得见他的歌声。    他的确听见了，就把他的歌翻译成了古老国家也喜爱的书，文采特别年轻和飘逸，还充满孩子气的滑稽，他翻译得太好！他走了很不近的一段路，认真地去买一支一毛钱的笔芯——太普通的缰绳，我在他身后的背影里。    我的这个童话也写完了。    （2022年5月13日）,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/7.htm,5/24/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,山中花事,,    周华诚    “山上的花都快开了，你们什么时候再来？”    小叶发来微信，顺带附上杜鹃花的重重花影——有的大红，有的淡紫，夹杂在如海的春山中，如云似锦，如夕霞如浪花，还有纯白的花丛如纱幔，在山野里寂寞地摊开来。    小叶是神仙居的导游。我上次去时，尚是冬天，入得山中时，满山云雾萦绕，仿佛进了仙境，远山与近色，都幻化在了缥缥缈缈的云雾之中，消失了，退隐了，彼情彼境，绝非人间所有。待到了南天顶的“天空之境”时，一会儿忽然云开雾散，石壁万仞，悬崖之上，观音峰忽然显现出来。那一瞬间，脚下数百米依然是云海，观音峰仿佛从云海之中生长出来一般，风起云涌，眼前与胸中，都是无尽的波澜壮阔。只一会儿，那如海的云雾又聚合起来，将眼前群山巨峰笼罩，如层层的纱幔重新遮蔽，仿佛是眼前的山峰，从未在世间打开过。那般的奇云幻雾，令人震撼无比。    那次就相约——还要再去神仙居。晴时去看，雨时也去看。想来都是不同的景致。冬日雪景想去看，深秋红叶也想去看，四时亦有四时的绝妙。这样相约不久，疫情却反复起来，一阵儿是这里不方便出行，一阵儿是那边防范升级。我等为了不增添麻烦，就尽量减少流动。神仙居下雪的时候，漫山如银装素裹，真是人间奇景，便也只能在小叶他们的微信朋友圈里看看，无法登临山中。到了春日渐醒，本也希望出行，无奈也有状况，依旧远程看山。    小叶常会在朋友圈里，分享一些山中美景，譬如二月的深山含笑开放，三月的杜鹃如云盛开。从二月稍晚开始，深山含笑在绿色森林里绽放，特别显眼。小叶说，山里的花，大抵不是特别的耀眼，但若俯下身来，则会发现许多零星的野花，这儿一丛，那儿一簇，有些也是不知名的，只自己在山崖上绽放，常给人惊喜。三月的杜鹃，则是景区的工作人员不辞辛苦种上去的，淡紫色的那种，长在栈道周围；另有一些野生的则是长在遥远的悬崖上。到了五月，还有野百合，会在山间如期开放。黄色的野百合长在悬崖间，或是流泉飞瀑的旁边。有时在栈道上行走，不细心的话，你就发现不了。那样的野百合，在千仞之高的悬崖的裂缝里，在几乎看不见泥土的地方，忽然生长起来，忽然冒出一枝，举着骄傲的花朵。此时，如果你也看到，一定会感叹生命力的实在顽强。    最近因了疫情，神仙居的旅游团队少了许多，只有零星的散客上山。小叶仍然会经常上山，她的同事们也依然天天在山中行走、工作、攀爬，依然在朋友圈中，快快乐乐地分享山中岁月的美好，似乎是说，即便此时此刻，你困在自己的生活中，若不能来此山中，我便要把山中之美分享给你。    神仙居，是括苍山第二高峰大青岗的余脉。山上矗立着无数天然巨佛，流传千百年来数不清的神仙传说。我想起来，上次在神仙居逗留，还知道些神仙居的创业故事。上世纪90年代，县里才组建成立旅游局，那里有悬崖绝壁、飞瀑流泉、茂密丛林、飞禽走兽，其天地造化，自然景观不亚于黄山、三清山，宛若仙人此地居，可惜藏于深闺人未识。许多工作人员不畏艰险，攀藤伏壁，把一条条沟、一道道坎都攀爬过，渐渐开辟出穿山小径，以及勉强可以从容行走的道路来，勉强把旅游事业做起来。    这二三十年，神仙居的美，一点一点呈现出来，人与自然的和谐，人与天地的意境，渐渐被认识和传播，神仙居的知名度，也不断被推高。那次，众人推崇一位朱先生，说他最为爱山，这山中的沟沟壑壑，没有一处他不曾走过；山中的一草一木，没有他不曾访过的。也正是有了他们，才有了这绝美的风景——然而，朱先生却一再摆手说，山自在，水自在，山水之大美本就在那里，几百万年了，自己不过也是山中一草尔，岂敢掠山的大美。    春天，不知不觉就在神仙居浓郁起来。我想着还要与朱先生见见，与小叶他们一起再去爬一爬神仙居的山。看云山雾海也好，看花花草草也好，都令我向往。山中还有一处“薜萝深处”，源自倪瓒的一句话，“苍藓浑封麋鹿径，白云新补薜萝衣”，这个意境真好，他是写给画家朋友张雨的，我也想去薜萝深处访一访。宋代画家郭熙说：“山有三远，自山下而仰山巅，谓之高远。自山前而窥山后，谓之深远。自近山而望远山，谓之平远……高远之势突兀，深远之间重叠，平远之意冲融而缥缥缈缈……”这样的三远，神仙居都有，春山如海，千崖滴翠，层层叠叠的山，渐次醒来的花朵，都在等着来客。松枝煮茗，我是想和你一起侣草木，友麋鹿，于山长水阔之间，共坐同饮一杯何如。    春天在这山里，我知道，正在轰轰烈烈地到来，小叶发来消息，说悬崖间的野百合蓓蕾沉沉，花期即将到来。阳光出来，疫情也必如这山中云雾一般散去，待那晴和之日，漫山的花朵都将开好，花们一齐在神仙居迎接你。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-24/8.htm,5/24/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,心系儿童的秦怡老师,,    秦文君    2010年8月第十一届的“全国少年儿童故事大王选拔”在杭州余杭举办，主办方很想邀请秦怡老师，因为秦怡老师一直关心着青少年的健康成长。    主办方电话打过去，联系到了秦怡老师，可她8月份的活动已排满，无缘这次大赛了。    主办方也预料到这样的情形，秦怡老师太忙了，何况当时89岁的高龄，还有天气炎热，路途遥远，于是想让秦怡老师给大赛提提建议，便向她详细介绍了活动。秦怡老师兴致勃勃地倾听，得知这讲故事比赛的活动不仅能丰富小朋友的业余生活，推动全国少年儿童讲故事的热潮，还能锻炼和提高小朋友们的口才，使很多小朋友从此更有自信。于是她说：“我参加的，既然是对小朋友成长有益的事，我一定千方百计克服困难，挤出时间来。”    给小选手颁奖定在8月12日晚上，当天下午我和秦怡老师及秦怡老师的女儿金斐姮一起搭乘商务车，从上海前往会场。整整3小时的车程，且天气炎热，气温飙升到39摄氏度，商务车的空调都略显不足。路况也很不理想，一路颠簸，大家都被车外的大太阳烤得晕乎乎的。    终于抵达了酒店。我担心89岁高龄的秦怡老师累够呛了，建议主办方安排她先去休息一会儿，没想到秦怡老师连连摇头，不顾劳累，一下车就投入到颁奖会的准备中，完全没有休息。晚餐时分，热情的主办方为嘉宾们准备了可口的饭菜，秦怡老师坐在圆桌旁，只是匆匆吃了几口鳝丝面，半碗菌菇汤，一边说味道不错，正是她爱吃的，一边跑开，一心一意工作去了。    秦怡老师待人谦和，工作异常认真，亲自撰写了发言稿，还反复和主办方确认发言稿中的活动情况、名称是否正确。    和秦怡老师一起出席颁奖会的嘉宾，除了我，还有作家叶辛以及时任团中央少年部处长的高彦明等。大家仰慕秦怡老师，围绕着她，看到她一点名人架子都没有，看她如此敬业、严谨，大家不仅敬佩她，还感觉她的亲和，非常喜欢她，私下里也说老人家的身体好，精力比我们几个旺盛多了。    在颁奖晚会上，我们被热情的获奖小选手包围了。高彦明说，他关注到秦怡老师极其认真地应每一位小朋友的请求，一个接一个地为他们签名留念。有的小朋友想签在纸头上，有的想签在本子上，有的很想签在获奖证书上，秦怡老师乐此不疲，还和小朋友们亲切交谈，回答他们关于表演的各种幼稚、好玩的提问。    没想到签字刚签了一半，一个男孩刚递上本子，台下老师的就招呼集合了，他心急火燎地走了。秦怡老师手里握着笔，满脸遗憾地从座位上站起来，目光在人群中追寻着男孩，不停地自言自语：“还没签完呢，真对不起呀……”    那一刻，她俨然就是一位对孙辈疼爱有加的邻家老奶奶。    活动结束后，秦怡老师要连夜赶回上海，因为第二天她还要参加另一个公益活动，恰逢我也有事需要赶回上海，于是秦怡老师、金斐姮和我又原车返回上海，一路上秦怡老师和我谈生活和电影，也说起儿童文学，她说：“其实我年轻时也有作家梦，写作有意思，为少年儿童写作，值得你百分之百投入。”    那次我和秦怡老师母女上海、余杭来回奔波，路上也听秦怡老师会自嘲一生辛苦。但这么长途的劳顿，高强度的公益活动频率，89岁的秦怡老师好像很适应，习以为常的样子，这让我欣慰，但也倍觉心疼，过意不去。    时隔两年，第十二届故事大王比赛的颁奖晚会，秦怡老师正在外地，未能出席，但她关心着这个比赛，向主办方问起活动的举办情况，一再说：“这么好的活动一定要坚持办下去。”    秦怡老师为慈善事业倾力捐出积蓄，还默默地为公益活动倾注过无数心血，多年来她确实是这么做的，各种纪念、庆典、慈善、义演等公益活动中都能看到她的身影，听到她真诚的声音。    难能可贵，她把善意、大爱、美好的感情撒向人间，无私奉献给可爱的一代新人。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-25/6.htm,5/25/22,第6版:夜光杯,,False
,孔雀开屏了,,    章慧敏    下楼做核酸，检测点正对着小区里的孔雀园。排队的队伍蜿蜒，我一路跟着前行，眼睛却锁定了笼中的孔雀。    还记得当年看房时售楼小姐引着客户走在曲曲弯弯的石径上，突然看到有4只孔雀悠闲地在草地里踱步、啄食。我看呆了，孔雀与绿地是如此和谐，这不就是一幅人与自然的实景图吗？售楼小姐显然读懂了我们的心思，她说孔雀对空气质量很敏感，小区里养孔雀是用来监察环境的。    不管这话是不是当年的一种噱头，我倒是愿意相信的。开发商能够在意业主居住的生态环境，管理水平能差到哪里去？是这几只孔雀让我当即决定把家安在这里……    前些天，小区微信群里有人说孔雀“阳”了，顿时引来议论。说实话，孔雀是业主们共同的“宠物”，它们的命运自然牵动人心。我想起当年搬来后就跑去看孔雀了，可发现4只孔雀变成了3只。门卫告诉我，当他们发现少了孔雀后也四处寻过，直到在一堆建筑垃圾里看到了孔雀毛和骨头才断定是被人偷吃了。那阵子正是小区的装修高峰，无法确定是哪家装修工造的孽。    这话让我心头一紧，我想象不出有人在费力地拔绚丽的孔雀毛时可以面不改色心不跳！打那以后，我对二雄一雌3只孔雀的命运格外关注，散步时常去看望它们。我不知道孔雀小小的脑袋瓜里是否记住了我的身影，反正有一天，那只雄孔雀突然开屏，就像是一把带着金属光泽的翠绿大扇子在我面前优雅地移动。那一刻我陶醉了。    然而好景不长，2只雄孔雀的伴侣死去了，它俩像是丢了魂似的，连灿烂的尾巴也渐渐掉得像个秃子。那时正值动物的发情期，它们没日没夜地叫唤，声音又涩又亮又高亢，真没想到漂亮的孔雀的叫声竟然如此不堪，我们小区8幢楼，大家的清梦被搅乱，噪声不时来。某天回家，发现电梯旁贴了张告示，是物业和居委联手向居民求助为孔雀“鳏夫”找对象的。这办法好，小区里什么能人没有？什么难处不能解决？果然有居民为它们解了难……    就在下楼做核酸等电梯时，正巧碰到物业的保洁师傅在我们楼层拖地。我问他孔雀的“阳”是真是假？他笑着说哪里呀，它们没阳，我们倒是去“方舱”呆了一周。    物业“阳”了8人，小区居民都知道，更要命的是我们这幢楼也陆陆续续曝出20几名阳性患者。那是一个至暗时刻，楼里人人自危，垃圾也无人收，群里一片焦虑！就在这时居委会书记站了出来，带着还在坚持的志愿者披挂上阵解了燃眉之急。我虽然看不见他们一层一层搬运垃圾的辛苦，但我的眼前会有画面，不感动不行啊。    可物业师傅还是带来一个坏消息，原本3只孔雀被野狗咬死了1只，现在仅有雌雄两只了。我问师傅为什么不能放孔雀在草地上自由自在呢？他连连摆手，说是因为孔雀会飞，在这非常时期，它们要是飞到其他小区，出门寻找都难……    做核酸的队伍还在前行。猛然间我发现那只雄孔雀展开了艳丽炫目的尾屏，哇，它居然在笼子里开屏啦。难道是因为它在这一个多月的封控后见到了众多友邻？难道是当初售楼小姐说孔雀有监察环境的功能应验了，它嗅到了夏之圆舞曲的浪漫。    一脸严肃的我们嘴角不由自主地上扬了，纷纷掏出手机拍下了带给我们心灵慰藉的这一幕，这是人与动物彼此间浸润心田的温馨啊。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-25/7.htm,5/25/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
网传“浦东120万斤西瓜滞销”实际没那么多，“战疫·帮侬忙”接单帮瓜农,直播吆喝  9万多斤西瓜卖光,,    前天“上海浦东120万斤西瓜滞销”的话题引发全网关注。在调查一夜后，浦东新区宣桥镇长春村所谓“14户瓜农290亩南汇8424西瓜卖不出去”的实际数据是：6户瓜农93亩9万多斤“尾藤瓜”可能滞销！“每个瓜都不能烂，每个农户都要帮！”昨天，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播中，“卖瓜模式”开启！在记者一声声“大家一起买瓜”的吆喝中，9万多斤西瓜有了“托底销售保障”！    农民心血不能浪费    在直播连线中，昨天一早赶到宣桥镇长春村的浦东新区农业农村委员会综合发展处副处长李永航表示，村里有14户瓜农共种植近300亩西瓜，全村今年第一茬西瓜可供销售的西瓜总计28万多斤。目前遇到困难的有6户93亩共9万多斤西瓜。之所以出现数字有巨大差异，极有可能是计算了全年两茬近300亩的数字。    “这些瓜不是最优质南汇8424瓜，是‘尾藤瓜’。”李永航说，往年这些西瓜是由零售商户运到附近路边和园区出售，因为疫情封控、交通管制，再加上这些农户没有运输车辆，所以才受到影响。“但每只瓜都是农民的心血、收获和希望，绝不能让它们烂在地里！”李永航告诉记者，区农委和宣桥镇在收到求助后，已迅速联系越亚农民专业合作社、金花湾农民专业合作社等，目前正在与农户对接收购事宜。    今年运得出卖得好    今年西瓜到底有没有因疫情而滞销呢？对此上海田地甜蔬果专业合作社施雷表示：“没有啊！我们这里的西瓜都卖出去了……”他所在的大团镇是8424西瓜最大产地之一。今年因为光照足、气温高，第一茬西瓜长势喜人，收成比往年增加。虽然疫情对于收购和运输有阻滞，但大团镇政府立刻为农户们建立瓜果群、蔬菜群，与百联集团旗下联华超市、叮咚买菜、盒马鲜生等直通对接，收购方竭尽所能及时调拨运力，让每只瓜都新鲜直送到上海各小区。“等到疫情过去了，这些帮了阿拉农民大忙的瓜果群、蔬菜群一定要保留下去。”施雷的话里充满感激。    记者又向书院镇、南汇新城镇等多名瓜农求证，反馈几乎一致：“运输车开得进来，西瓜全运得出去。瓜不仅卖得好，收购价还比往年高了！”    商超保障平价出售    那么，今年8424西瓜是不是因配送问题而“一瓜难求”？有没有因为“奇货可居”而涨价？百联集团旗下联华超市生鲜采购负责人王加民介绍，疫情期间，联华超市为农户卖、市民买都开启了“绿色通道”。不仅是西瓜，甜瓜和蔬菜等都是如此，“今年的西瓜不仅在数量上比往年多收购了几百吨，收购价格也提高了。”王加民表示，通过线上销售和线下配送，联华超市一直保障着市民“菜篮子”的平价供应。“现在不少门店都开了，实惠‘买买买’更便捷了。”王加民告诉记者，8424西瓜价格往年也略高于其他瓜种，重9斤以上的瓜市场单价约70元，“8424瓜一根藤只能结一只瓜，只有去年种植过水稻且五年内没有种植西瓜的地，才能播种。因此农户的投入成本还是很高的，但今年的市场价格基本与往年持平。”    昨天下午，宣桥镇长春村的田头已是细雨蒙蒙。“装车！起运！”一辆辆满载着西瓜的货车出发，9万多斤西瓜卖掉了。抹了抹脸上的汗水和雨水，农户们面庞上笑容绽放着。    本报记者  王军  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙   诉求数报    5月24日11时至5月25日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求168件，其中紧急类诉求107件，已推动解决91件（含“公益联盟”15件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-25/8.htm,5/25/22,第8版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False

医院门急诊陆续恢复  与奥密克戎的交手带来哪些改变？,着手细节降风险  升级硬件防未然,,    随着疫情防控形势向好，申城医院门急诊陆续恢复，如何在保障医疗机构日常运营的同时做好院感防控？    过去2个多月里，在与奥密克戎变异株的这场“遭遇战”中，大家意识到，对奥密克戎的防控策略，不能还停留在两年以前了。记者观察到，医院或从细节着手降低感染风险，或升级硬件防患于未然，推出一系列新的应对之策。    精准研判  加强通风    本轮疫情中，复旦大学附属中山医院门急诊、手术等医疗救治从未停歇。数据显示，近两个月，该院急诊多次单日接诊量超1000，较平日上升42.85%；救护车单日接诊多次超100辆，较平日上升68.33%。    医疗救治的通道保持畅通，在感控上采取的一系列综合措施发挥了实效。中山医院感染病科、医院感染管理科主任胡必杰介绍，中山医院利用新冠核酸Ct值，精准研判感染者及其传染性，快速转运病人。“理论上，Ct值每减少1，意味着感染者的病毒载量翻倍。”胡必杰称，“同时，也要看感染者处在什么阶段，是起病阶段，还是恢复阶段？”    他举例说，如果核酸阳性的Ct值40左右，而且采样后数小时获取报告单，其间一直戴口罩，那么感染者的传染性很小，密接者的圈子可以划得很小，避免医务人员不必要的“非战斗性减员”。    精准研判后，隔离、消毒也要快。“对付奥密克戎，一定要以快制快，在几个小时之内，就把整个防控措施全部落实到位。”胡必杰解释，对于病区里的核酸阳性者，能马上转移的，就马上转移出去；不能转移到院外的，就安排到负压单间病房，至少要离开原先的非隔离病房。    胡必杰还认为，现阶段是最需要强调医疗场所室内空气通风的时候。这是因为，对于奥密克戎而言，如果没有很好的通风，室内如果有感染者，将有大量含病毒的气溶胶排到空气当中，存在巨大风险。中山医院在急诊抢救大厅和急诊补液室，将多个窗户的大玻璃换成大功率排风扇，还添置了数台移动式空气消毒机。此外，医院还增加了使用次氯酸雾化方法进行空气和物表消毒。    应急装备  平疫结合    疫情防控下，如何做到既保证急危重症病人抢救，同时也做好新冠肺炎疑似病例的隔离筛查呢？海军军医大学第一附属医院（上海长海医院）给出的选项是：便携式负压病房。    “便携式负压病房是一款多功能应急装备，只需10分钟就可搭建完成，还能在短时间内根据患者需求进行‘变身’，既可用作核酸结果不明患者的隔离治疗室，也可化身临时血透室、临时产房、临时抢救室等。”长海医院消化内科王洛伟教授告诉记者，“其内置的新风系统可以将污染空气过滤为干净空气，过滤率达到99.99%以上。”    5月14日，80多岁的孔阿婆因突发走路不稳伴恶心呕吐，被送到了长海医院急诊。由于孔阿婆出现新冠病毒感染的相关症状，医院急诊第一时间启用便携式负压病房对她进行救治，仅用2分钟就转换成了脑卒中抢救室。医生进入后，给予心电监护检测生命体征，并根据病情变化调整治疗方案。与此同时，孔阿婆的核酸结果证实为阳性，待老人病情平稳达到转运标准后，她被转至定点医院展开后续治疗。    自5月投入使用以来，便携式负压病房在上海长海医院急诊已完成40多例急危重症患者的紧急隔离收治。    缓冲楼层“楼长”负责    为了最大限度降低住院病房疫情防控风险，上海交通大学医学院附属仁济医院对内外科大楼各科室的整体布局做了精细化调整，每幢楼宇均设置缓冲楼层。院方解释，急诊收治但尚不能满足入院条件的患者会先来到缓冲楼层单间隔离，需要急诊手术的患者则按照医院院感防控要求，进行人员防护和负压手术室手术。    在每晚7时的仁济医院疫情防控工作例会上，各“楼长”率先发言，逐一通报每日所管辖楼栋的人员信息、核酸检测、楼层管理等情况。每位“楼长”由一名院领导担任，全面管理一栋楼宇。无论是出入口管理、院感防控、就医流程、医疗救治，还是环境卫生、安全消防、服务质量、物资保障等事务，“楼长”全权负责。    实行“楼长”管理措施以来，各项责任被“扛起来”了，疫情传播风险“降下来”了，重点人群行动轨迹“稳下来”了，各项制度的执行“严起来”了——就从一直是“老大难”的大楼出入口管理来看，原来遇到问题，通常采用远距离指挥协调的方法，处理时间较长，部分突发事件处置效果不佳；有了“楼长制”管理机制，所有问题现场决策现场解决。出入口处的闸机设置规则，就是“楼长”根据实际情况和多日运行观察后做出的合理调整。    本报记者  郜阳  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/5.htm,5/26/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
票抢不到，妻子术后无法回昆山急煞丈夫　再次接单，送广西爸爸返乡的“车神”出发,“回来了，一切都会好的”,,    “我们回来了，一切都会好的……”轻轻从别克商务车上抱出已经无法行走的妻子，59岁的袁先生一步步稳稳地走到疾控转运车旁，然后弓着腰，小心翼翼地、慢慢地将她放到座位上。    “泪目泪目，眼眶湿了”“愿阿姨早日康复，愿有情人相守一生”——这短短的几步路，这暖暖的一抱，瞬间感动了在线上一路守护的网友。    再苦再累，也不能累着她    几天前，就在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急热线直播连线中，电话那头，传来了袁先生阵阵无助的哭泣。3月14日，他陪着患有胸腺瘤的妻子从江苏昆山赶到上海，在位于浦东新区的上海交通大学医学院附属仁济医院东院，接受手术治疗。在收到出院通知后，袁先生虽然费尽心思，可高铁票就是抢不到，暂住的宾馆也找不着。“我妻子刚刚做了手术，医生说必须早点赶回家平躺静养。她现在连站都站不动，出了医院我们举目无亲、无处落脚……我再苦再累都不要紧，可千万不能累着她啊！”袁先生对妻子的一往情深，暖到了听见通话的每一个人。    记者迅速向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出信息，上海裕皖实业发展有限公司再次接下了“使命必达”的任务。昨天中午11时，在风雨兼程穿越1700多公里转运广西爸爸、在连夜奔驰600多公里护送安徽爸爸、实现他们生命最后时刻的愿望后，“裕皖实业”的别克商务车又一次出发了。车子抵达仁济医院东院，“护送二人组”郑洲、汪纯轻手轻脚地把袁先生的妻子扶进了车内。“阿姨，听说您有糖尿病，叔叔特意关照我们准备木糖醇的沙琪玛。您要是饿了，先吃点，要不了多久就能到了！”车辆启动，向着家的方向驶去，“紧急转运直播”再次开启“线上守护”。    多打点工，让她别再省了    一路上，袁先生的妻子双目紧闭，虚弱无力地半躺在椅子上。紧紧握着妻子的手，袁先生的眼神片刻都未曾离开过她，哪怕一声轻轻的咳嗽，都会引来一阵紧张的关切。对于妻子的病，袁先生一直有着深深的自责：“我和她一直是打零工的，赚得不多，但特别辛苦。为了这个家，她省吃俭用，身体再不好也不愿去医院看，都怪我没有照顾好她，才拖出了这场大病……”    在上海治疗的日子里，袁先生倾尽所有。“幸好这条命算是救回来了，但这是个开腔的大手术，人伤了元气，吃了大苦头。希望她回去后好好养养，别再省了。我身体好多打几份工，什么都会好的……”在妻子的耳边，袁先生低声说着。    1个小时后，车子抵达昆山收费站，等候20分钟左右，当地疾控中心的车辆赶来转运了。搂着丈夫的脖子被抱进转运车的时候，妻子的眼角有泪光闪动。斜倚在座位上，对着直播镜头，她使劲举起手臂，吃力地挥动着，一声声弱弱的“谢谢”，此刻听得分外真切。    63公里——短短的路，满满的爱。挥手道别，愿深深相爱着的人一路相伴、一生幸福。  本报记者  王军  钱俊毅,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/6.htm,5/26/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,怀念黄蜀芹导演,,    佟瑞欣    一早起来翻朋友圈，看到了黄蜀芹导演去世的消息。    又一位好导演离我们而去，又一位上海电影标志性的电影人去了。黄导在医院待了很多年，今天黄蜀芹导演去了所有人最终都要去的我们所不知道的那个世界。    一部大戏    在拍摄《上海沧桑》之前，我在上海拍的戏不少，但是这样主流大戏并不多。一部《上海沧桑》使我和黄蜀芹导演建立了深厚的友谊，友谊的基础是来自我们合作上的相互信任，这半年的合作之后，我们建立了深厚的友谊。    《上海沧桑》是当年市里的一部重点戏，可谓调动了优秀的主创队伍。我之前在长影拍摄一部清朝戏，进组比较晚，而且头是刮光的，刚进《上海沧桑》剧组，在试装时候就需要使用不同时代的头套，当时导演组其他人及化妆师都面露难色。而黄蜀芹导演非常果断，跟在场的所有人说这个角色（唐三浦）已经确定请佟瑞欣来演了，需要多少头套就去做多少头套。这是我对黄蜀芹导演的最初印象，让我觉得她是一个有自己观点并坚持自己观点的人，绝不会因为周围人左右摇摆的眼光而动摇。所以后来当AB组一旦有拿不定主意的时候，演员就喊“请黄导来”，黄导一到，问题就解决了，争论、犹豫不决都消失了。我想这就是演员和导演建立信任的第一步，有了这一步，才有了我们后来的相互信任，有了我们深厚的友谊。    我在《上海沧桑》中所扮演的唐三浦需要从十几岁演到一百岁，也就是说这个角色的百年生命历程折射出了上海的百年沧桑。我想黄蜀芹导演请我来演唐三浦之前应该对我做了一番了解和调查，因此她果断地决定，从十几岁一直到80岁的唐三浦由我一人完成，80到100岁的年龄段，请了老一辈艺术家刘琼来担任。记得后来戏拍到一半的时候，有一天黄蜀芹导演突然找到我，她说现在拍摄强度比较大，怕已经高龄的刘琼老师承受不了，80岁  到100岁的唐三浦你一个人完成可以吗？当时我很吃惊，我也有冲动完成一个百岁人物的塑造，可后来我跟她讲，这会留下一个很大的遗憾，我们很多人都期待刘琼老师出现在这部戏中，我感谢黄导对我的信任，可我更加期待能与刘琼老师共同完成一个角色，这对我来说意义不一样。黄导演最终改变了她的想法。总之，在《上海沧桑》这半年的拍摄中，一来二往的合作、交谈，哪怕只是因为一个长镜头的讨论，最终让我们加深了解，结下了深厚的友谊。    一通电话    后来，电视台播放了《上海沧桑》，收视率非常不错。有一天，我接到了黄蜀芹导演的电话，黄导讲上海青年话剧团的李家耀老师看了电视剧给她打电话，谈到了我，核心是为什么《上海沧桑》的唐三浦在字幕上的排序靠后，他提出自己的看法。其实，对我来说，能得到李老师这样的长辈、同行和观众的认可更重要，我说了请他千万不要往心里去等一些话。说完这番话，黄蜀芹导演很长时间没有说话，静止了一会，她说，“这是不应该发生的事情，我明天就叫他们改。”后来听说真的改了，我想因为此事黄导一定面对了许多压力，我很幸运身边总有这样的良师益友，他们乐见青年人的成长，对青年影人坦诚相待、一路保护，是像灯塔一样的存在！    隔年我到北京参加电视剧《大宅门》的拍摄，见到了黄导的老同学，也是我的良师益友导演郭宝昌，我记得当时郭宝昌导演跟我说，《上海沧桑》是一部好戏，就是上海的《大宅门》。    后来才知道，我和黄蜀芹导演住得非常近，有一次我接到了她的电话，“你在干嘛？在看孩子吗？你下来一趟，我有个剧本要交给你。”我推着当时还是婴儿的女儿，在马路上和黄导演见面，她给我的这个剧本是她准备了很久的一个剧本，而且她希望我演的这个男主角与我之前所塑造的角色反差非常大。我当时说怕演不了这样的角色，而此时的黄导演，就像我第一次在《上海沧桑》剧组见到她的时候一样，她非常坚定自信地说：“你能演，而且你应该把它演好，你应该挑战一下。”后来这部《围城续》，因为种种原因没有拍成，留下了遗憾。    一次探望    2013年6月18日，得到黄蜀芹导演所住的嘉定养老院的地址，我和夏菁及严晓频一起去看望了她。黄导房间摆放着许多书，护工讲黄导演很喜欢看书，很少和人说话。看到黄导演之后，我有点难过，发现黄导渐渐对周围的事情反应变慢，甚至有不认识人的情况，不过她还记得我，她说你总是笑呵呵，看到你就高兴。夏菁为我们一起拍了照，后来我们还一起到养老院的食堂吃了碗面，黄导叫上了同样住在那里的剧团前辈张莺老师，临走我一再嘱咐护工要多陪陪黄导说话，散散步。    再一次的探望，是2014年的6月11日，在上海第六人民医院，这个时候的黄蜀芹导演几乎不太认识人了，但还认识她的老同学。那天，她电影学院的同班同学郭宝昌导演还特意买了一束花，但看过老同学之后，郭宝昌导演的心情一直不好，非常非常伤感，离开医院很久，他一直跟我念叨，“她变化太大了！”    因为奥密克戎，整个上海失去了太多。我站在阳台上，抬头望过去，远处上海的天被雾笼罩着。我想对我来说，失去的不仅仅是一位优秀的导演，失去的是一位曾经信任我的人，鼓励我的人！    人到中年，生活也就平常了很多，喜欢的角色能塑造当然好，擦肩而过也不惋惜，而我很在乎的是，我又失去了一位很好的良师益友，一位给过我信念的人，这种失落难过，无可比拟！    怀念您！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/7.htm,5/26/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,体会幸福的可贵,,    陈美    下午的线上教研活动，让我感触颇深。尽管网络不给力，发言者的声音时断时续，但几十页PPT真材实料的干货，着实令人叹服。    说真的，这几天心绪颇不宁静，总觉得四面有高高围着的墙压过来。本本分分、安安静静地按照自己喜欢的方式做事，是开心的，可偏要你干这干那，既要成就甲，还要服务乙，也不能怠慢丙。    比如，你得听一场和你关系不大的讲座，你得填一份毫无意义的表格，你得按照模板写一份形式主义的报告，你得上传一张轰轰烈烈工作的照片，你得参加一个可有可无的会议，你得……有时还让你分身乏术。你突然觉得自己很重要，仿佛谁都离不开你。    这不，你得放下案头做了一半的课件、还没批改完的作业，上线参加教研。    从无所谓的心不在焉，到有点意思的目不转睛，直至很有道理的全神贯注，最后是叹为观止的五体投地。那位老师年纪不轻了，曾因用眼过度，视网膜脱落。在学校担任两个班级的教学任务，每天批改近百名学生的作业，我讶异她那早已老花的眼睛，怎么吃得消。今天，她要做一个主题的交流分享，几十页的课件，要花多少时间收集资料，然后分类、提炼、归纳、总结、制作课件。结束的时候，她跟大家说抱歉，她起初忘记打开麦克风，让大家看了几分钟的“哑剧”，再从头开始，浪费了大家的时间。    整整八十分钟，讲到最后，她都气喘吁吁了。那是怎样的一种坚韧和勤谨啊！    稍后分享的是一份青年教师设计的作业——看视频、做影评、做编剧，在真实的语境里，引导学生筛选信息、梳理表达、审美创造，把枯燥的文言文学习，整得兴味盎然，很契合当下的热词“素养目标”。    我们还看到了一份字迹不太工整的作业，竟是一个男孩伏在方舱医院的床上完成的。    不知怎么，我眼前清晰的屏幕模糊了，我的眼眶里充满滚烫的液体。    许久以来淤塞在胸的某种东西，一下子被撞开了一条缝隙，汩汩地流淌出来。    犹如徐徐清风，拂去了我眼前的雾霾；恰似涓涓细流，滋润了我干涸的心田。    这些分享，使憋闷的心灵变得舒畅了，使困倦的精神变得亢奋了，使狭隘的胸怀宽广了。    使人想起：老骥伏枥，志在千里！    使人想起：穷且益坚，不坠青云之志！    使人想起鲁迅《一件小事》里的话：我这时突然感到一种异样的感觉，觉得他满身灰尘的后影，霎时高大了，而且愈走愈大，须仰视才见。而且他对于我，渐渐的又几乎变成一种威压，甚而至于要榨出皮袍下面藏着的“小”来。    我的“活力”这时大约有些凝滞了，坐着没有动。    直到主持人宣布会议结束，我才惶惶然站起。    大仲马借基督山伯爵之口说：世界上无所谓幸福，也无所谓不幸。只有一种处境与另一种处境的相互比较。只有那些曾经在大海里抱着木板经历凄风苦雨的人，才能体会到幸福有多么的可贵。尽情地享受生命的快乐吧，永远记住，在上天揭开人类未来图景前，人类的智慧就包含在两个词中：等待和希望。    是啊，每个人的人生，都有诸多限制和不如意，我们也许无法控制发生什么，但是可以控制自己的情绪及心态。当我们主动选择自己的思考方式，就是把生命的主动权拿到了自己手上。积极正向地解读身边的人、身上的事，我们的人生一定会收到积极正向的反馈。如果我们在做决定前，能给自己一个冷静思考和处理的机会，给自己多一份耐心，凡事往好处想，人生也许就会少一份遗憾。    就像现在，宅家，也能有学习的机会。天天向上，不亦乐乎。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-26/8.htm,5/26/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,外省市返沪回小区有何要求？,市防控办：各区要指导督促街镇做好政策解释，不得阻拦拒绝,    今天上午10时，上海举行第196场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。    近期有一些从外省市返沪市民反映，在回沪的时候遇到难题。市卫健委回应，根据本市疫情防控有关要求，来沪返沪人员须持有抵沪前48小时内核酸检测阴性报告。    所有来自或途经国内疫情中高风险地区的来沪返沪人员，应在抵沪后尽快且不得超过12小时向所在居村委和单位（或所住宾馆）报告。对所有来自或途经国内疫情高风险地区的来沪返沪人员，一律赋“红码”，并实施14天集中隔离健康观察，实行相应频次的新冠病毒核酸检测；隔离期满且核酸检测均为阴性，转赋“绿码”。    对所有来自或途经国内疫情中风险地区的来沪返沪人员，一律赋“黄码”，并实施14天严格的社区健康管理，实行相应频次的新冠病毒核酸检测。社区健康管理期满且核酸检测均为阴性，转赋“绿码”。    同时提醒广大市民，非必要不离沪，非必要不出境。在来沪返沪后开展7天的自主健康监测，其间每天早晚两次自测体温，减少不必要的人群聚集活动，规范佩戴口罩。    市防控办要求，各区要指导督促街镇加强对接，做好政策解释疏导，不得阻拦、拒绝有关人员返回社区。    另外，对于广大市民比较关心的疫情期间电费缴费问题，国网上海市电力公司总经理阮前途说，国网上海电力已于4月5日公布了《全力防控疫情保障供电服务十项举措》，其中明确承诺对受疫情影响、交费有困难的居民用户，严格实施“欠费不停电”和“减免违约金”的便利举措。疫情期间采用远程采集的方式进行抄表，如果当月采集不成功的，则采用“估抄”或者下月合并出账的方式。由于疫情原因，3月、4月的电费纸质账单还未能投递，给不少居民客户带来了不便。居民客户在收到纸质电费账单后，请留意账单上标注的最后缴费期限，只要在此期限之前完成缴费，就不会产生违约金。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/3.htm,5/27/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,“难上加难”求职季如何突围？,大学书记直播带“人”“一生一档”精准辅导,    阳光明媚的日子里，留守在华东师范大学的师生们种下了又一季的毕业花——耐寒耐旱、种到哪里都能生根开花的土豆花在今年入选。    往年，过了“金三银四”的5月，是各大高校就业工作的收尾阶段，而在这个极不平凡的时期，推进应届毕业生就业还处于攻坚阶段。申城多所高校负责就业工作的老师透露，疫情影响下，大学生求职时更多抱有求稳的心态，而学校也在积极引导毕业生，尝试到能“开花结果”的土壤“生根”。    岗位  少    多重因素叠加    最新数据显示，今年上海高校毕业生共22.7万人，比去年增加2万人，截至5月6日，毕业去向落实率36.47%，比2020年同期高10.03个百分点，但比去年同期低6.54个百分点。上海市副市长陈群在疫情防控新闻发布会上坦言：“高校毕业生就业面临着很大压力。”    “疫情造成了就业市场供需有一些失衡。”上海电机学院分管就业工作的学生处副处长张跃辉分析，从市场角度来说，部分企业停产或降低产能，同时压缩人力资源的投入；另外，企业对未来的预期也发生了改变，扩大产能的意愿不强烈。    此外，由于疫情防控需要，申城高校自3月起纷纷进入封闭管理或准封闭管理状态——线下招聘会取消、学生也无法到企业实习。“线上沟通的方式限制了用人单位对学生潜力评估的有效性。”张跃辉坦言，“也有企业认为，应聘者除了业务能力之外，和团队的默契程度也很重要，线上同样很难显现。”    疫情对毕业生的求职意愿也有潜移默化的影响。“大学毕业生主力军是00后了。以往我们调研发现，他们的价值追求多元，除了薪资报酬和专业对口外，还会考虑工作和生活之间的平衡、关注个人情感和价值的实现等。”张跃辉告诉记者，这两年来，毕业生求职趋于保守，考研、考公务员、入职国企的意愿明显增加。一部分毕业生“大公司不要我，小公司我也不要”的心态，成为就业工作难以顺利开展的原因。    据其他高校负责就业的老师介绍，有毕业生原本已和企业达成了意向，但是由于疫情，双方“牵手”的前景变得模糊，也造成了焦虑情绪在学生间蔓延。    办法  多    效果超过预期    这两年，直播很火。直播可以带货，可以卖农产品，那能否带“人”呢？在今年的就业季，申城高校开始尝试直播这种方式，别具一格的形式赚足了眼球，不仅参与企业超出了学校预期，而且效果同样喜人。    “这是一名非常优秀的学生，综合能力强，很有后劲……”早在3月30日，上海海洋大学党委书记王宏舟就带着20名毕业生亮相直播间，通过B站、抖音、视频号向企业推介学生。这样的直播，到5月中旬已经进行了十多场。    直播带“人”的新形式，原本是学校“没有办法的办法”。“我们从去年冬天到开春都在走访企业，现在到了签约面谈的关键时期，不能等解封了再做工作。”王宏舟说，“出乎我们意料的是，直播到后期，企业人事部门开始抢人了，甚至有‘潜伏’在观众群里的其他企业直接给学生发了意向签约信息。”    该校学生就业创业服务中心主任孙红刚透露，在直播之前，学校形成了12份调研报告，对接了很多企业，确定了15类毕业生的就业市场，涵盖了755家单位。“根据调研情况，我们筹划推出第二阶段直播，有针对性地邀请企业，使得这一系列的直播推介更加聚焦，人岗匹配度更高。”    在华东理工大学，化学与分子工程学院2018级本科辅导员顾益江最近一直在为264位毕业生的前途奔忙——有的学生考研初试成绩不理想，准备放弃。顾益江拿着他们的成绩单，查阅、整理目标院校的往年录取分数、复试要求等信息，逐一和同学交流。他把相关高校的调剂信息推送给符合条件的同学，指导他们有针对性地准备复试。最终，学院有9名同学调剂成功，约占年级考研总录取人数的1/3。    此前，教育部还发起了全国高校书记校长“访企拓岗促就业”的专项行动。在这一契机下，上海外国语大学积极挖掘与毕业生相匹配的岗位信息，分学科专业开设多场次空中招聘会。自3月至5月中旬，累计组织17场空中招聘会，提供6000余个岗位；累计发布2.6万余家用人单位的就业实习招聘信息，提供7.7万余个岗位。“学校在学生宿舍楼和教学楼内开辟一批独立‘面试室’，配置线上面试设备，提供实时技术服务支持，全力保障学生线上面试需求。”该校就业指导中心主任曹姝婧透露。    记者了解到，目前上海正全力推动应届生就业工作：一是出台各种政策性岗位、企业税收减免、社保补贴政策，鼓励企业聘用应届生；二是加强网络招聘和岗位募集，市级层面直接组织毕业生线上招聘会，并持续到8月底；三是优化毕业生就业落户政策，第一批落户从疫情平稳后开放并受理至8月底，第二批将于2022年年底开放受理。    攻坚  难    期盼合力突围    上海海洋大学学生就业创业服务中心主任孙红刚向记者感慨，以往大四上半学期，就有一批毕业生敲定了工作，“金三银四”的求职季，大部分学生确定方向，考研的学生也陆续完成了面试，5月本是个收获的季节。“今年相当一部分毕业生的求职之路是停滞的，推动就业工作还在‘攻坚期’。”孙红刚说。    该校校长万荣在接受采访时透露，学校也在积极引导和鼓励毕业生赴基层就业。2021年学校有541名毕业生到中西部地区就业，在中西部广袤的大地上发光发热。    上海交通大学长期以来加强对学生在校期间的思想引领和专业培养，精准输送更多优秀交大学子到祖国和人民最需要的地方建功立业。据悉，今年上海市高校毕业生就业协议0000001号-0000100号签约学生均来自上海交大，全部投身国家重点行业单位。    当下，对于尚未明确未来方向的毕业生，申城高校多采取精准排摸，“一生一档”，分类指导，按照学业困难、再次考研、求职能力弱等各类重点群体制定精准帮扶计划，并且充分利用校内外资源为学生提供春招特训营、个体咨询、简历指导等。    据悉，上海国资系统正着力促进高校应届毕业生就业工作：市属和区属国有企业，特别是在沪企业，将在年度招聘计划中，安排不低于50%的就业岗位，面向本市高校毕业生定向招聘；上海共青团助力复工复产“千校万岗·就业有位来”高校毕业生网络招聘会也于5月23日正式启动，将提供用人需求岗位98283个。    在多所高校就业指导中心的老师看来，这样的经历，是一种历练，在走向社会的临门一脚接受更多的挑战，也是宝贵一课；同时，除了政府和企业帮一把，学校扶一把，也需要学生真正动起来——只有多方共同奔赴，才能合力突围。    从学校角度而言，“难上加难”的求职季也带来了诸多思考和经验。“今年，我们组织了在校学生中有摄影特长的为毕业生拍证件照；请来资深HR讲行业发展前景和企业对人才的要求；还通过已经就业学生的朋辈影响，促进就业意识的提升。”上海电机学院学生处副处长张跃辉谈道，“大学生就业难题，只要肯下功夫、用心思考，就可能会是另一种别开生面。”    本报记者  郜阳  易蓉,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/4.htm,5/27/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,“红马甲”居委书记偷偷学骑助动车为哪般？,,    “大倪，你怎么脸色这么差？是不是生病了？别再撑着了，核酸检测有我们看着，你快去休息吧。”“没事没事，我就是感觉心慌胸闷，有些气短，我稍微坐一会就没事了。”这个被居民昵称为“大倪”的，就是普陀区长征镇象源丽都居民区党总支书记倪晓倩。    过了一会，细心的志愿者见她的脸色还是不好，强行把她扶到居委会“盯着她休息”。大倪拿起手机在“微信诊室”向小区“白衣天使”咨询自己该吃什么药。5秒不到，“白衣天使”们数条信息涌过来：“保心丸赶紧吃起来”“我现在给你送点药来”……大倪这才乖乖吃了保心丸，短暂休息了几小时。到了晚上，又继续投入繁忙的抗疫任务。    象源丽都居委会下辖象源丽都、绿洲湖畔花园2个小区，住户近3100户8000多人，居民区工作人员只有8人。从3月4日开始，象源丽都陆续封楼，居委会唯一的男士封控期间长期夜班值守，腰椎受伤，被迫回家休养。后来，疫情防控一波又一波重任来临，倪晓倩带领着平均年龄34岁、清一色的“娘子军”，吃住在居委会，与380余名志愿者一道守护全体居民的安康。    核酸检测、物资配送、门岗把关、阳楼消杀、为老服务……哪里有需要，倪晓倩就冲向哪里。保供物资配送、团购物资短驳，大家忙不过来。为提高效率，更好地服务居民，不会骑助动车的倪晓倩，悄悄学会了这门技能。那天下雨，她为了让志愿者和社工能稍微休息一下，骑着助动车去给居民短驳物资，结果，雨天路滑加上新手不熟，车上物资比较沉，一个不小心，她重重摔倒在地，手腕一下肿了起来，坐在雨中足足挣扎了五六分钟，才终于爬了起来。忍着痛，她继续推着助动车，把物资安全送达居民家门口。回到居委会，她拿起手机咨询了“白衣天使”，用了药后继续投入工作。    封控期间，居民的配药难一度成为亟待解决的问题。为疏通这个堵点，象源丽都居民区党总支与志愿者代配药组多次召开红色议事厅会议，倪晓倩与组员充分交流、反复沟通，经过几天的摸索，逐渐理顺、优化配药流程，形成配药全链条闭环管理机制，大大提升配药效率。配药组从最初的4人，扩展到现在15人，完成配药600余份。    细心的倪晓倩发现，社区有医疗背景的志愿者竟然不在少数，而有问诊求医需求的居民也蛮多的，那为何不建立一个问题清单、需求清单，搭建一个互联网问诊平台呢。    经过与志愿者的反复商议，倪晓倩将社区内近70名有医护资质的志愿者会聚起来，开通了一个互联网“微信诊室”，由楼组长或患者居民发布求助信息，第一时间传递至志愿者群，医师进行线上预判诊疗，给出就医建议。“有时去治愈，常常去帮助，总是去安慰”，这支医疗救助队疫情期间开了一张又一张身边的“处方”。    作为社区的“大家长”、社区工作者团队的“主心骨”，倪晓倩每天扑在社区防疫中。今年40出头的她总笑着说，“最近白头发越来越多了，这些暴露年龄的白头发，都是从2020年疫情时候长出来的。”    倪晓倩总喜欢穿那一身志愿红的马甲，“鲜红的颜色格外醒目，像一面旗帜，在人群里、在社区中，能很快被有需要的人找到。”    本报记者  江跃中,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/5.htm,5/27/22,第5版:综合新闻,,False
6岁白血病患儿濒临断药，“药神妈妈”等公益联盟爱心人士和企业接力相助,最难时幸遇好心人  现在我要帮更多人,,    求助    6岁儿子患有髓系白血病，去年8月在河北石家庄医院做了造血干细胞移植手术，术后一直要服用抗排异药物“环孢素口服溶液”控制病情。由于疫情封控，5月13日就在石家庄配好的“救命药”，至今仍滞留在石家庄转运中心。    我们全家现在都在上海生活。眼看着5月28日快到了，家中就要彻底断药了，孩子随时可能因为病情恶化而危及生命，为此我们全家心急如焚，尝试通过健康云App等方式预约儿科医生，但系统始终提醒出错。四处碰壁后，我是吃不下睡不着，孩子的妈妈更是常常以泪洗面。    浦东新区浦东大道3076弄    沈先生    帮忙>>>    濒临断药父亲焦急    在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急热线求助直播中，沈先生焦急地向记者表示，儿子造血干细胞移植手术做完后就回到上海的家中休养。“万一断药，出现排异，后果真的想都不敢想……我们好不容易才救回了孩子的这条命，难道还要眼睁睁看着他离我们而去吗？！”电话那头，传来的是沉重的叹息和发颤的语音。    父亲的求助刻不容缓，在向“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟发出最紧急信息后，“药神妈妈”许女士立刻回复：“这件事，我一定帮！”    这个母亲的孩子，也是白血病患者。为了不让6个同病相怜的孩子遭遇“断药危机”，她从广州辛苦找来了化疗药物“门冬”，为此她被其他患儿的家属称为“药神妈妈”。在药物运到浙江湖州的家中后，许女士却为全程冷链配送伤透了脑筋。在向“战疫·帮侬忙”求助后，刚送完广西爸爸的公益企业上海裕皖实业发展有限公司两位“车神”郑洲、汪纯立即改道湖北，直奔湖州，带着“药神妈妈”和药赶到上海（详见5月19日6版《返沪途中“车神”改道6名白血病患儿有救了》）。之后，许女士也加入了“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟的“战队”。    爱心接力跨江送药    接下“救援任务”后，正在复旦大学附属儿科医院为孩子办理入院化疗手续的许女士，立即找到了刚准备下班休息的血液科主任医师李军。    “口服液没有，但环孢素胶囊有。效果是一样的，6岁患儿可以温水送服胶囊中的颗粒……”李医生一边仔细关照着，一边迅速开出处方。配好药后，“药神妈妈”让儿子等在医院门诊大厅，旋即赶回暂住地交给了邻居，让她代为转交运送。    “生命救援”的最后一棒——跨江送药，由公益企业途虎养车接单。工作人员驾车赶到闵行区万源路400弄望族新苑取药，随后立即跨越黄浦江，送达浦东大道3076弄。当沈先生夫妇收到“救命药”的那一刻，禁不住掩面而泣：“有救了！孩子有救了！”    当记者再次拨通“药神妈妈”的电话转达谢意时，许女士连忙回答：“应该的。在我最难的时候是好心人帮了我，现在别人有了困难我也必须相帮。”    本报记者  王军,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/6.htm,5/27/22,第6版:战疫·帮侬忙,,False
,断舍离与囤货,,"    龚静    前一段日子上海的高频词是什么，米面油是也，蔬菜水果肉蛋牛奶是也，可乐饮料巧克力麦芬什么的非基本生活类堪称奢侈。最低频最不被人待见的肯定是断舍离，它曾经风靡一时，大家纷纷在说要学会扔东西，却如今各种资粮都是好的。临期食品，怎么了，吃；角角落落翻出的巧克力饼干，宝货啊；扔在冷冻屉不受待见的红糖糕，让人心里一稳；不吃绿叶菜的，哪里还会浪费；不吃这不吃那的，现在都吃了；团购望穿千眼，还挑三拣四？不买菜的，必须关心粮食蔬菜和肉蛋；大吃大喝惯的，也要学会省吃俭用，留有余地……当然，还是慢慢好起来了，面包有了，物资丰富了，喜欢的可乐咖啡巧克力都有了。    所居小区三月九日就开始封封解解，所以早就能网购就网购，冰箱不大，至少够塞，赶在快递停滞前还买了点肉松饼干山药粉等小食，心里不慌，并不会去抢菜，后来就参加小区团购，不等不靠，也算自给自足。说起来平时略有点小囤货癖，食物一般买双份，若有合宜的东西优惠时那也不妨再多几件，还可以分享亲朋。四月初某日戴好口罩，将抽屉柜子纸箱各个角落都细细翻检了一遍，发现冰箱储存外，尚有黑豆黑芝麻粉若干，红豆花生粉若干，山药粉压缩饼干红枣若干，罐头若干，黑木耳笋干若干，将之分门别类归拢，药品诸种也清点整理，茶叶虽然不顶饥，不过也可以去烦，这么清理整理了一番，心里颇有收获感。    四月中旬时民进复旦支部的Y老师来电寒暄，我说我这边生活物资有的，平时有些小囤货，一时半会不会弹尽粮绝，你自己也有吧。他说平时不太舍得扔东西，所以现在看看倒还好。交流下来，都是60后人，那么也都是经历过拮据年代的人，感同身受那个年代的匮乏。彼时什么都要凭票供应，半两粮票亦珍宝。清晨四五点钟起来跟着外婆去菜场排队买豆制品，要买点热气肉还得赶早，一人无法分身呢得用砖头代替排队，好在大家都是彼此彼此，不会斥你插队。夏天菜场进货新鲜蔬菜，消息像风一般传遍老街，下午一个个拎着竹篮头朝菜场紧走，番茄黄瓜，卖完就完了，那真是抢菜，毕竟下一波何时来只有天知道。吃根油条要克制，最后能留下一小截，弄点酱油开水煮一煮，撒点葱花，可作一汤佐餐。这样的成长年代，大概骨子里会刻录危机基因，哪怕非自己积极主动印刻。    接下来，经历了改革开放，经历1990年代初商品经济大潮、下海潮、股票认购证，再有商品房、消费社会、911、世界局部地区的战争、金融危机、洪灾地震、信息社会、AI时代、SARS，新冠，在时代发展变化的轰隆隆中，读书工作生活观察，内心深处似乎并没有因为生活的稳定，年龄的增长而获得充分的安全感。个人可以确定的是，不确定是确定的，无常是常态。普通人把握不了大势，稍稍储备一些物资还是可以的，当然也不必杯弓蛇影，自己吓自己，有个心理准备总归不会错，毕竟天地不仁以万物为刍狗。    团购群里看对话，感觉不少是年轻人，他们开始想念螺蛳粉，想念可乐饮料蛋糕，要吃辣条炸鸡，宝妈则紧张着平日小孩子习惯的吃食告罄，换口味小儿不接受，猜测乃85后或90后们居多。不同年龄段对必需品的理解不同啊，毕竟都智能手机年代了，除了米面油胡萝卜洋葱卷心菜，蓝莓可乐蛋糕为什么就不能买呢。毕竟他们没有经历过拮据紧缺的年代。两代人的观念在封控特殊时期产生冲突也不足为怪。    并不因此而不赞成断舍离了，封控积累起来的经验大概也使人更能甄别何种需留，哪样当断离了吧。比如不断换新产品的瘾是否需断，远超出自己购买力的消费行为是否自省，等。除了物质，某些不相谋之人，某些需要厘清的观念也要离，或者过往对某个区域某种情形过多的期待，甚或某种乌托邦式的想象等,皆需细细思考。学习与省悟和物资一样，需要累积囤货，皆为闭居或解封之后生活状态的必需品。",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/7.htm,5/27/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,为熟悉的陌生人点赞,,    李大伟    那天一早，孩子他妈喊：“小宝，到小区儿童乐园领花！”“儿子在做功课。”我挺身而出：“我去取！”“侬去做啥？瞎起劲！”噢，原来是母亲节！对啊，相对我，她是夫人，不是母亲。我开车送儿子去取，发现都是丈夫带着孩子去的，捧着素白无瑕的芍药，回家送给妈妈，而且由孩子送上。    如果妈妈们去领花，回家献给自己，多没面子呀！女人可以给自己烧菜，犒劳自己。也可以在周五下班回家，给自己买束花，回家插在客厅中央的圆桌上的琉璃束腰竖瓶里，给自己添个好心情。但自己给自己献花，不是犒劳，而是自嗨。    就像谈朋友，一定是男的请女的：喝茶吃饭看电影，这叫潜规则。    写在黑板上的叫规则，比如进办公室必须穿西装、系领带。    不言而喻的叫潜规则，比如进办公室不能穿背心、趿拖鞋。    自然而然的叫作“文化”，比如在母亲节给年龄稍长的阿姨送花。    婚前进咖啡店，男士买单。    婚后进咖啡店，夫人买单。    时尚女性，下班路过咖啡店，会进去坐下，自己给自己买单，看看街景，然后回家，那是上海的西式文化，在巴黎街头常见。但陌生男人过来给你买单，一般人不会坦然接受。    取花点在儿童乐园，这个位置让妈妈们倍感骄傲，最佳磁场，相当于男人站在女厕所附近的绿化带里，拎着包等女朋友。遮阳篷下叠着一个个硬板纸箱，两位姑娘守着，笑盈盈地一一递上喇叭口的一捧花——油脂画纸像只蜡烛包，呵护围拢地扶直花儿。我们小区住户近千户，这是一笔不小的开销。远大于几只正牌LV包包，这就是格调与境界。    小区还有位邻居，靠生产农业饲料起家成为当年中国首富的东方新希望——后来拓展养猪事业，独生女留学回来，下猪舍养猪。四月份刚被封控时，食品紧张，她决定赠送，一户一肩猪，一头猪左右双肩，一肩从肩到尾，剁去头与腿，中端长方形：五花肉与排骨，送到家还是软软的带皮热气肉，巨镬锅红烧肉，不仅喷香，而且微甜。    上海的女人很矜持，尤其婚前，搭足豆腐架子，上海话叫“放放彪劲”，让追求者围着你转，摸不清你的心思。底层逻辑：婚前得到不易，婚后倍加珍惜。如果婚前热情逢迎，上海人就要称之为“倒贴户头”，坍台！小姐妹间一辈子抬不起头。    这次上海被封期间，各个小区涌现出大批志愿者，女性占了大部分：贴时间贴精力贴铜钿，统统都是“倒贴户头”，像阳光付出不求回报。“倒贴户头”这一名词，疫情期间开始凤凰涅槃，蜕下贬义的蚕茧，蝶化成仙，披上了褒义词彩衣。    被封前小区有个业主群，人数很少，那是为了选举业委会，听说是吵架群。被封后，现在几乎户户参与这个群，守望相助。谁缺了打印纸，立刻有人上传放置货物的方位照片，且注明门牌号，这样不必敲门致谢，既免被打扰，又获得帮助，保持有温度的距离，相当于父母与婚后子女一碗热汤的住宅距离。等你晚上开门，放置捐物的地方，可能有一板短颈啤酒，显示受惠者的感激。有时团长团的货，达不到起送份额，就自然顶包拿下，然后将多余的送给保安保洁。天天忙着关注群的，基本是太太，互不相识，却互通有无，甚至吐槽聊天，上传偏爱的美食品牌，转发共同关心的问题。被封前小区的邻居们都是彼此孤立的“原子人”，在群里成了“陌生朋友”，如刀背的两面，彼此隔离又背靠背，刀刃是汇合点。    现在饭后出门散步，迎面对视，立刻点头微笑，尽管还是陌生的朋友。    危机意味着转机，拜被封之赐，上海人又进步了：从对熟人的微笑，进化到对陌生人微笑。被封前，上海人对着陌生人视而不见，尤其陌生的异性，否则就有花痴的嫌疑。    熟人社会对熟人友善，这是农耕村落的文明。    陌生人社会对陌生人友善，这是都市人文明。    对熟人微笑，对陌生人冷漠，这一直是都市人的面部表情。被封前，上海人是遵守公共规则的城里人，虹镇老街苏北人，青云里湖北人，永安里广东人为主，浙兴里多宁波人，鞍山五村多山东人，深深烙印乡村熟人社会的阴影。    被封期间，小区里的邻居们，开始对陌生人报以友善的微笑，不惜援之以手，不求回报。上海人开始割城里村落人的尾巴——境界仅限于遵守交通规矩，否则罚款坏分，这是源于物质层面的利害得失；甩掉乡村熟人社会的阴影——对陌生人微笑。    4月送猪肉，5月送花。送肉是物质层面，送花是精神层面，哲学原来是这么感性，看得见摸得着。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-27/8.htm,5/27/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,中风险地区实施14天封闭管理,,    今天上午10时，上海市举行第197场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会。市卫生健康委副主任赵丹丹通报，昨天，松江区报告1例新冠肺炎确诊病例（轻型），为相关风险人群筛查中发现。截至今天9时，共排查到在沪密切接触者13人，均被集中隔离。其中3人核酸检测结果阳性，这3人是松江报告病例的同住人，已被确诊为新冠肺炎确诊病例（轻型）。    松江区副区长顾洁燕介绍，昨天报告的1例确诊病例是一位女士，67岁；3名阳性感染者系其儿子、儿媳、孙子。    根据本市目前疫情形势和相关规定，经市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作领导小组办公室研究决定，将松江区方松街道滨湖路585弄列为中风险地区。该小区有居民1594户，实有人口3797人。目前，已对该小区实施封闭管理，落实“足不出户、服务上门”防疫要求。小区暂停快递外卖，由街道组织生活物资保供。街道成立“求医问药专班”，组建2个应急就医小分队，24小时对接居民求医配药需求。    市卫健委表示，上海疫情中风险地区的划分是按照国家有关标准，综合阳性感染者数量、区域分布、疫情风险等来划定范围。原则上，疫情中风险地区以居民小区、自然村、单位等作为最小划定范围，可适当扩大至毗邻风险区域。区域内14天内累计报告不超过10例阳性感染者，或者发生1起聚集性疫情，该区域划定为疫情中风险地区。    对疫情中风险地区实施14天封闭管理，人员足不出户，服务上门；落实相应频次的核酸检测。根据疫情形势、防控需求以及阳性感染者相关场所轨迹等，必要时可采取区域核酸筛查、风险人群排查管控、环境清洁消毒、人员外区转运隔离、聚集性活动限制、公共场所管控、公共交通限制等防控措施。    区域内报告最后一例阳性感染者后，如连续14天无新增阳性感染者，该区域降为疫情低风险地区。  本报记者  左妍,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/3.htm,5/28/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
疫情下中小企业主难在何处，盼有哪些？,复工难，先要稳住企业基本盘,,    占上海企业总数9成以上的中小微企业，正面临各种考验。上海中小企业发展报告最新数据显示，中小企业数量超过50万户，占全市法人企业总数99.5%以上，从业人数1169万。    企业在，岗位在，就业就在。每一个企业背后，是一个个家庭。企业抓紧恢复正常生产，员工的家庭生活才有保障，上海的城市活力才能恢复。    订单难找、成本难降、账款难收、人流物流难畅通……新一轮疫情对中小企业经济运行带来了冲击。本报今起开展系列调查，记者首先走进四类有代表性的中小企业，了解他们面临的难题，倾听他们的期盼。    企业1    传统制造业  成立19年    难  新业务停滞    盼  政府帮一把    5月17日，俞川华终于回到办公室，坐镇指挥。他是上海一家高新技术企业的负责人。“3月27日起，30多名一线员工在工厂封闭生产。5月中旬，我们的复工申请获批，有少部分员工回到工作岗位。目前，三分之一的员工在岗。现在的政策是复工和回家，只能二选一，上班了就不能回家。有些双职工家庭，上有老下有小，没办法复工。”    可是全员复工，压力可能更大。“我复工后最忙碌的事情，就是为员工张罗吃的，尽可能改善大家的伙食。我们所在的工业园区目前没有开放公共食堂，有的员工已经吃了一两个月盒饭。我们想方设法采购物资，但消耗得太快。如果全员复工，园区配套措施跟不上，会影响高效复产。”    俞川华的企业是生产应急物资的，自认对处理各种应急情况已有经验，但这次的封控时间之长还是有点出乎意料。“我们立足传统制造业十几年，坚持不容易，转型更不容易。去年依托数字化开辟了新业务，发展势头很好。但此次疫情，一下子按下了暂停键。新业务都需要一城一单跑出来，人员出不去，业务就没法开展。封控两个月，公司销售收入为零，但所有员工的工资我们都是全额发放的，坚持生产的员工还要额外奖励。企业对我们来说就像养育一个孩子，我们对每个员工是有责任的。希望政府能看到企业在疫情中的付出，能帮的就帮一把。”    俞川华对网上一个段子，特别有感触。“我三个月没理发了，就算解封了，也不可能一个月理三次。有些需求没有了就没有了。”让他庆幸的是，公司在安徽还设有一个工厂。上海封控期间，订单生产没有受到太大影响。    但俞川华不是一个悲观的人。“对任何一个企业来说，未来的风险压力都很大，但再困难也要过日子。我们只能越来越谨慎，业务不扩张，原计划开展的招聘暂停，先稳住企业的基本盘。”    企业2    餐饮服务业  成立13年    难  错过了旺季    盼  正常上下班    从今年3月中下旬开始，现制饮品企业的在沪门店基本关停营业，受影响的不仅是市民们的“奶茶自由”，还有品牌商们的收入骤减，以及上游供应链的集体“寒冬”。    本周一，位于莘庄工业区的德馨浓缩饮料（上海）有限公司收到一个好消息，公司已进入复工复产“白名单”，但总经理史文超却觉得压力重重。“现阶段的复工，必须是闭环管理，作为企业负责人，我该如何解决员工的日常生活？”    人员流动受阻，员工出了小区，就不能回家，40多人在公司打地铺，还要管好吃喝拉撒，这是第一个“难”。公共交通目前仍有断点，机动车又不能上路，员工如何扛着电脑，背着被褥，走完上班路，这是第二个“难”。各个点位的防疫手势不相同，这是第三个“难”。    此时，史文超正坐在嘉兴的隔离酒店中，这周三，他和两名同事到嘉兴工厂出差。何时能回上海，也是未知数。“离开小区前，我们都签署了承诺书，保证在上海疫情结束之前，不回小区。”曾经一两天就能往返的长三角之旅，现在变成了“君问归期未有期”，史文超只能和女儿约定，在她9月开学前一定赶回家。    公司业绩下滑更让企业掌门人身负压力。2009年成立的德馨饮料，是星巴克、肯德基、麦当劳、瑞幸、奈雪的茶、七分甜、书亦烧仙草等多家连锁餐饮品牌的服务商。今年3到5月，销售额相比去年同期下降25%左右，利润率更是大幅度下降。“受疫情影响，我们为餐饮品牌在沪门店提供原料供应的业务大面积停滞。再加上仓库在上海，出货到外地也有很多限制，大部分线路的物流费用增加到原来的2到3倍。”    往年的第二季度，是史文超和同事们最忙碌的时候。为了迎接即将到来的夏日消费旺季，他们会推出多款新配方，生产多款新原料，期待成为一炮而红的网红饮品。但今年二季度至今，上海实验室“颗粒无收”，总部员工依旧居家办公。“希望早一点，再早一点，我能重回上海，同事们可以正常上下班。”    企业3    外贸行业  成立31年    难  至今在“静默”    盼  客户别流失    “今天忍不住来办公楼看看，亲切又陌生。园区里的草坪已经变成过膝高的草原，还有一只猫咪静静地看着我。”前两天，拿到出门证的赵立申（化名）骑了几公里的自行车，去看看自己的公司。站在大门紧锁的办公楼下，他在朋友圈发了这段话。    2020年初，他的公司是上海第一批复工的企业，2月10日就恢复生产，不到一个月复产率达到100%，员工到岗率达到98%，2月份销售同比两位数增长，是“回血”较快的企业。2022年，公司至今还在“静默”。    “复工复产后，员工必须居住在厂内闭环管理。但工厂没有可居住的环境，缺乏足够的独立卫生间、洗浴间和宿舍。”他告诉记者，即便有能力把闭环管理和防疫措施安排妥当，启动了生产线，还可能发生原物料运不进来，库存仅够生产一两周的情况。    停工两个月，货物发不出去，海内外的客户流失怎么办？他坦言，目前公司的业务员仍在积极与客户交流，及时沟通上海复工复产的推进情况，但由于公司生产的是消费品，有一定的可替代性，客户流失是无法避免的事情。“一旦其他公司稳定供货，我们就会被替代。很现实，也很真实。”    企业4    IT服务业  成立14年    难  贷款发工资    盼  找到新机遇    “就像疫情期间，有人时不时要看一下冰箱，看看自家囤积的物资是否够用，我也时不时看看公司的账面金额。最近现金流越来越紧张，我们不得不向银行贷款来支付员工工资、房租等。”一家IT服务企业的创始人许刚说。    年销售收入近7000万元，在上海打拼14年，许刚这一路走来，稳扎稳打，业务增长积极向上。他的公司客户多是世界500强企业，由于这些企业大都也处于居家办公状态，认可他们以远程方式提供服务，收入并没有受到太大影响。但由于封控时间过长，开票开不出，客户的款项也无法支付，现金流出现短缺。“另外，占据公司业务三分之一的线下拓展类项目，停滞了。”    房租、人工、社保，是摆在他面前的三道难关。他的公司在新天地的一处写字楼，办公面积500平方米，一个月租金十几万元；公司员工全部居家办公，工资足额发放，这部分成本在收入中占比很高；社保每个月支出约100万元。“这2个月，这些成本一分没少。”    更让许刚感到担忧的是，未来企业发展的不确定性增大。“绝大部分客户都是全球布局的外企，他们会不会调整供应链策略？”对此，许刚已有准备。去年开始，公司开始探索创新业务，在上海成立团队面向国内客户提供数字化解决方案。“我们打算把新业务放在长三角其他城市。”    5月25日，国务院召开全国稳住经济大盘电视电话会议。许刚从中读出了许多令人振奋的信号。“总理提出，要努力推动经济重回正常轨道，着力保市场主体以保就业保民生。做企业十几年，危机从未少过，我们要有信心从危机中找到新机遇。”    本报记者  叶薇  张钰芸,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/4.htm,5/28/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
疫情中，走近虹桥火车站的到达乘客——,他们是谁？ 因何而来？,,    5月27日，轨交10号线虹桥火车站站，携带行李的乘客有序进入单向通道前往候车厅。另一边，同样带着大包小包的乘客到达上海，搭乘10号线去往城市各个角落。    有人走也有人来，刚刚抵达申城踏上地铁的他们是谁？又要去往这座城市的哪里？在这特殊时期，乘坐轨道交通需要注意什么？    有人来上班有人中转    5月22日起恢复运营的轨交10号线虹桥火车站站仅服务于到达和离开上海的铁路旅客。离沪的人们近来各大媒体多有报道，那么抵沪的人们又是带着怎样的心情？    28岁的毛女士从宁波过来，她有两个目的——和男友团聚、去公司上班。“4月底的时候面试上了这里一家公司。”受疫情影响，晚了一个月她终于能来入职了，“也联系好了男友的小区，居委会告诉我可以住那里。”    从河南信阳而来的周先生则是为了家中亲人。“上海的亲戚生病了，专程过来照顾他。”周先生顾不上多说，和我们匆匆告别。    搭乘10号线的还有中转的乘客。“我和老伴要乘坐明天的国际航班。”刚从G7514列车（宁波-上海）下来、68岁的郭先生说，“3月底从加拿大回国探亲，先是落地上海隔离了14天，之后回到宁波又隔离了14天，其实探亲的时间并没有多少。”尽管路程多艰，但郭先生觉得“这段日子浦东机场一直维系着国际航班”，这一点很难得。    进出“三件”一样不能少    作为交通枢纽站与线路终点站，10号线虹桥火车站站的出与进，直接关系到“防输入”与“防外溢”。    虹桥火车站站的站长高煜介绍，进入车站的乘客要注意三件事——车票、“场所码（绿）”、核酸阴性证明，三样一样都不能少。    车票指的是当日有效车票。目前该站仅服务于抵离沪铁路旅客，须持有当日铁路上海虹桥站到发火车票方可进出站。场所码，则是乘坐全网线路都需要的“通行证”。值得一提的是，刚抵沪的外地乘客可能“场所码”显示为绿码，但是并没有关联的核酸报告，此时不用担心，只需要展示出发前在始发地做的核酸结果即可。    高煜表示，规定的“核酸阴性证明时间”是从采样时起算的“48小时”内，并不是报告出具时间，请大家出行前预估好时间。    “如果有不符合以上规定的人想要在此乘坐地铁，那么我们会进行劝返。”高煜告诉记者，10号线虹桥火车站站恢复运营多日来，客流整体平稳有序，进出站的人数也逐渐达到了往日的十分之一。    本报记者  董怡虹  陈炅玮,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/5.htm,5/28/22,第5版:综合新闻,,False
,“宠物爸爸”乐当“送药侠”,附近小区隔离居民家的30多只“喵星人”和“旺星人”，也都归他照顾,    93岁阿婆的三七伤药片买到了！糖尿病爷叔的胰岛素送到了！这些天，靠着一副热心肠、骑着一辆电瓶车，“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟的“宠物爸爸”宋建礼连连接下市民发来的紧急求助，一次次往返奔波，一次次使命必达。    阿婆摔伤  三七片来了    5月23日，市民朱女士向“新民帮侬忙”发来求助，93岁的母亲住在杨浦区四平路街道，身边只有智力残障的小女儿相伴。由于疫情封控，朱女士无法像往常一样上门照料。最近母亲在家摔倒，但急需的三七伤药片却一直都配不到。每次一想到通电话时老人痛苦的呻吟，朱女士就心疼得直掉眼泪。    接到求助后，记者迅速在“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟群中发布了消息。“我查到药店了，我出发了！”公益个人宋建礼的回复干脆利落。骑着电瓶车，宋建礼先是到线下药店配好药（上图），随后立刻送到朱女士母亲所住的小区。“阿拉姆妈吃了药之后，情况好多了，真勿晓得该哪能谢谢这位好心人！”回访中，朱女士的话语里满是感激。    爷叔断药  胰岛素送达    5月24日，杨浦区翔殷路871弄居民张女士向“新民帮侬忙”发来求助，楼上邻居徐阿姨的丈夫患有糖尿病，在宝山区城银路830号的药厂闭环工作近两个月后，随身带着的胰岛素“诺和灵30R”就要用尽。单位附近买不到，家里有药也送不过去。一想起丈夫断药可能引发的后果，徐阿姨是吃不下饭、睡不着觉。    这一次的“求助工单”，又被宋建礼一把“抢”下。他骑着电瓶车先赶到徐阿姨所住小区拿到胰岛素后，一调头就朝着宝山区城银路快速驶去，可半路上突然发现电瓶车只剩两格电。来回还有40多公里路，眼见着实在撑不到终点，宋建礼赶快呼叫支援，找来“跑腿”小哥，接力完成了运送任务。    宠物之家  帮忙帮不停    疫情期间，因为经营着宠物店，附近小区居委会请他代为照料隔离居民家的宠物。热心的宋建礼二话不说接下“任务”。消毒、洗澡、喂养……被伺候得舒舒服服的30多只“喵星人”和“旺星人”，似乎都不愿跟着重返小区的主人们回家了，因此宋建礼被大家叫作“宠物爸爸”。    而一天到晚忙不停的宋建礼，还帮着老人线上抢菜、线下团购。一传十，十传百，爷叔阿姨们都知道了这位热心小伙。谁家要是少了菜米油盐，一个电话就打到“宠物爸爸”这里，接单、采购、送货……小区封控，但老人家里的“口粮”却从没断供过。    “只要能帮上大家，我就特别开心！”在第一批就报名加入“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟后，如今的“宠物爸爸”更忙了。    本报记者  王军  钱俊毅    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月27日11时至5月28日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求109件，其中紧急类诉求73件，已推动解决52件（含“公益联盟”15件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/6.htm,5/28/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,后生，你好吗？,,    彭瑞高    “后生”这词有意思，从字面看，是“后来生的”意思，“先生为兄，后生为弟”；对小辈、后嗣可称“后生”，对弟子、学生也可称“后生”；但有句上海话说“你后生（口+来）！”这里的“后生”又成了“相貌年轻”之意。    我朋友中许多“后生”，这次疫情中都挺到了抗疫第一线。    三月中旬后，我家钟点工阿姨就再也没来过，她家小区成了封控区。原以为会很快解封，没想到，后来竟出了两百多例阳性，一下成了重灾区，这可怎么办？也真巧，我一位后生朋友，受命带领工作组十几名成员，下沉到这个小区，开始了艰难的抗疫。    我跟这后生一起工作过，对他有些了解。他是副局级干部，冒着被感染的危险，沉到高风险地区，与居委干部同吃同住，两个月没回过家，这事真的不多见，以至有人说他“不值”。    我跟他微信时说起这事。他说：组织上下派工作组，我们责无旁贷，什么值不值，现在基层就是火线，我们不去谁去；像我这样党龄长一点的，重大关头更应该顶上去，不是吗？    他从来不说空话。到小区后，立即穿上密不透风的“大白”防护服，戴着勒出深痕的口罩，与居委干部一道值班，一同守夜；一起协助医护人员上门检测，一起维持秩序搬运物资，一道为群众解决急难愁盼……    我知道他的脾气，干起来肯定“辣手辣脚”。也是，一个小区出了两百多例阳性，再不果断下手，天就要塌了！他调研后，立马带着全组做了几件硬事：一是全员筛查，应检尽检，迅速摸清家底；二是日清日结，阳性、密接当日转运；三是强化管控，足不出户，坚决截断传播链。这最后一事尤其难做，他们严正警告违规行为人，请公安普法、报警察执法，扶正祛邪，在小区形成了强大正能量。另一方面，他们又与居委商量：小区内70%是外来打工者，年轻力壮胃口大，怎么才能配好相应的保供物资……    霹雳手段，菩萨心肠。四月底，有一幅示意图传来，我一看就懂了，那是经过几番较量、几番曲折，一度肆虐的“阳”终于被降伏了！    这两个月里，还有几位抗疫一线的后生与我常联系。其中一位年轻干部跟我视频，笑着说：“彭老师，您还认得出我吗？我到村里已一个多月，头发长得连自己都不认识了。这样见您真不礼貌。可是要剃头吧，街上理发店都关着。”听他嘶哑的声音，看着他憔悴的样子，我一时不知说什么才好。    还有一位后生，因工作疏忽受到处分。他微信我说：对不起彭老师，这次“题目”没做好，不过您放心，我会将功补过，尽快赶上去……    “疾风知劲草，板荡识诚臣”。这些后生都是好后生。汹涌的疫情，锻炼了他们，也教育了他们；尖锐的现实，警醒了他们，也刺痛了他们。忧虑、责任、压力，令他们夜夜难眠。什么叫“忧国忧民”，相信在火线上，他们会刻下永久的记忆。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/7.htm,5/28/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,莫让婚姻清零,,    北北    “疫情是婚姻的照妖镜。”言之有理，在漫长的居家封控朝夕相对中，“妖”和“仙”都得现形。一些相关的社会新闻引发了我们的思考，为什么有的人想离婚，而有的人却想复婚？展现戴安娜、查尔斯和卡米拉三角关系的英剧《王冠4》给了一种答案。这部剧从心理学视角解读了为什么戴安娜的婚姻败给了查尔斯的爱情，又为什么戴安娜拥有全世界人民的爱却无法拥有丈夫的爱。    在心理学层面，查尔斯和戴安娜的关系像父女，可惜他不像一些男人喜欢掌控关系，喜欢的是成熟平等的对话关系。在整个婚姻期戴安娜是非常努力的，可越努力越不幸，把查尔斯越推越远。因为她的努力不在点子上，没有“投其所好”，而是聚焦自己的爱好，比如展示跳舞和唱歌剧。查尔斯喜欢的是莎士比亚和园艺，可惜戴安娜毫无兴趣。在婚姻的最初他们一定共同努力过，然收效甚微，精神层面的提升和心理层面的成熟非一朝一夕之事；两个人也一定有过快乐时光，可叹短暂，昙花一现。戴安娜的成熟赶不上查尔斯所需的步伐。    反观卡米拉，她仿佛隔岸观火，无意卷入这场战争。她并没有刻意讨好，而查尔斯一直很需要她。她洞悉时局，在查尔斯很想离婚时劝他不要离，她对自己有着明晰的定位，成熟且情绪稳定，越是如此查尔斯越爱她。贵族无生活之苦、育儿之困，只求点精神上的东西，所以查尔斯离不开她，因为她能给查尔斯一种心理慰藉和归属感，她的一句肯定就能让他死心塌地。她不战而胜，和查尔斯的感情历久弥坚。    戴安娜一直试图在婚姻中寻找爱情，不愿面对查尔斯不爱她的现实，这是她痛苦的根源。爱情并非战争，而是一种强大的内在吸引，或许是量子纠缠又或许是习惯了一个系统无法去兼容另一个。若她看清了这一点，放弃对爱情的执念转战职场，结局或许不同。作为王妃的戴安娜非常成功，美丽亲和却不得丈夫的爱，这种境遇让她赢得了更多民众的爱。她当时的全球影响力是不输撒切尔夫人的，若用此影响力去多做些社会工作，成就自己作为“王妃”的职场价值而非执着于做个幸福的妻子，就不会如此痛苦，而一个幸福快乐的人总能有更强的能量磁场，也会迎来更适合的爱。    婚姻走到今天，已经从“利益结合”到“因爱结合”再到“心理适合”，我们环顾四周会发现，无论因何原因步入婚姻殿堂，能满足彼此心理需求的伴侣才能长处久安。懂得、互启、平等、互重成了现代婚姻的关键词，而这些关键词植根于认知和心理层面的成长，成长的步调和谐一致才能跳出动人的双人舞。    爱情是童话，唯有贵族才能爱情至上；婚姻是现实，托底普通人的生活。我们可以依然相信童话的美好，也要敢于面对现实的无情。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-28/8.htm,5/28/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,从单日增106人到22天无新增,他们在嘉定最大“城中村”战疫,    嘉定区江桥镇五四村，已经连续22天没有新增病例了。这两天，居民们已按规定有序开放；而曾经，这里是嘉定的疫情“风暴点”，单日新增最高时达106人。五四村是嘉定区最大的一个“城中村”，村宅民房、39家企业、公寓楼房犬牙交错，村中建厂、厂中有厂。在本轮疫情中，五四村累计确诊病例超过1200例，属于拔点攻坚点位。4月18日，今年53岁的嘉定区江桥镇总工会主席、五四村下沉干部组组长张国民，与同事们来到了这里。    摸清“火点”    11个工作组分工明确    在五四村大约0.8平方公里的区域面积里，实有人口9000多人，外来务工人员集聚，占总人口的88%。而原来的村干部只有十几人。连续几十天高强度长时间的超负荷工作，高居不下的新增病例，村民们的不理解……凡此种种，已让他们的身心到达了崩溃的边缘。    4月18日，张国民接到江桥镇党委书记的一通电话。30分钟内，他就与同事赶到了五四村，坚守至今。一开始，他只带了4个同事赶到五四村，分别负责转运、消杀、物资领取以及特保管理。随后的几天里，点位上的工作人员和志愿者增加到了93人。这些增援力量，为五四村的基层干部群众带去信心。    “抵达驻点后，我们第一件事就是成立数据分析组，排摸全村信息，并对所有数据进行分析。”张国民深知摸清底数的重要性，在他看来，第一时间掌握“火点”，方能作出及时有效的应对。从那天起，工作组会根据每天的动态信息制作日报。根据实际情况，张国民又细分了指挥组、生活保障组、核酸检测组、物资保障组、后勤保障组等11个工作组，并推出12条“最严公约”，开展村级防疫工作。    消除隐患    5个公厕“最严”管理    “整个村子就像一个大院子，老人多、小孩多，而且硬件条件比较差，绝大多数民房都没有独立卫生间。”防疫工作逐渐开展，但摆在张国民眼前的困难，是显而易见的：五四村人员密集、巷弄狭窄，往往一个人感染，就会导致一整栋楼“团灭”。    村里80%的人家没有厕所，他们共同使用5个公共厕所。张国民与同事们想过许多对策，最终选择了“最严”公厕管理方式：“村内每个公厕安排两人24小时看守，并要求每次只能进出一人，每次都做好消杀，另外再安排4个保洁员随时清洁卫生。”    就这样，随着各项工作的有序开展，五四村新增病例数像“走楼梯”一样下降了：100多例、60多例、20多例……到5月7日，新增感染者数字降到了“0”。    不敢懈怠    就像我的第52场马拉松    其实，在下沉到五四村前，张国民与同事们已经在江桥镇增建村连续奋战25天了。增建村曾是嘉定区唯一的中风险地区。可以说，嘉定本轮疫情中最难啃的两块“硬骨头”，都离不开张国民与同事们的付出。    抗疫这两个多月，张国民感到最亏欠的就是自己的母亲。“我母亲86岁，耳背听不见，她就住在增建村，以前我们五个子女每周都会去看望她。”而后来，在张国民下沉支援增建村担任点位长的日子里，由于封控管理，尽管每天经过家门口，都没能去看母亲一眼。“她染病后，是其他工作人员转运走的；她出舱后，我又在五四村工作，也不能去照顾她。”    这些日子，张国民不止一次落泪：在接到母亲“你怎么不来看我”电话时，在看到同事们无怨无悔奋战一线时，在看到村民们有序排队配合转运时……“有一位同事的亲叔叔去世了，另一位同事的爷爷也去世了，他们都是当天就继续投入工作。”    张国民的爱好是跑马拉松，他已经在全国各地跑了51场全程马拉松。“我觉得，这次抗疫之战就像是我的第52场马拉松。”如今，他与同事们仍在奔跑，不敢懈怠：“再坚持坚持，就到终点了。”    本报记者  杨洁,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/4.htm,5/29/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,遭遇封控　租客延期搬离怎么办？,租客  遇疫情无奈延期一个多月，押金可抵当月房租  中介  不收房不返押金，须承担租约满后两个月房租,    求助    去年4月，我通过普陀区中江路1039号的“塘鹅租售”，租下了长征镇梅川路799弄33号101室作为办公场所。今年4月14日租约到期后，因疫情封控，一时无法将物品全部搬出。到了5月20日，在严格落实各项防控措施后，我紧急清空了场地。但没想到，中介和二房东竟以此为由，拒不收房、拒不返回押金，要求我必须承担租约已满后的两个月房租，甚至表示将通过法律途径索赔。  市民  陆女士    帮忙>>>    延期搬离遭遇索赔    “我现在真是走投无路了！”昨天中午，在新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”紧急求助热线直播电话连线时，陆女士的话语里满是无奈和无助。她告诉记者，这套房子每月租金6500元，租期一年，今年3月起，房子就因疫情封控而无法使用。“租约到期后，我确实没有立刻清场，但这也是因为上海发生疫情这个不可抗力因素啊！何况就算我没有搬走，封控管理期间，这房子能租出去吗？！”陆女士说，此前自己已付清一年租金，5月20日她搬空所有物品打扫干净屋子后，二房东和中介不仅坚决不肯收房，还提出索赔要求。“我已经承诺6500元押金可以不要，作为延期搬场一个月的租金，但他们还是不依不饶，要我必须再承担5月至6月的一个月租金，否则将采取进一步行动。”面对这咄咄逼人的架势，陆女士彻底蒙了。    中介、房东称无过错    记者随即与“塘鹅租售”取得联系。一位自称姓高的经理称，在这件事中，中介和二房东没有过错，是陆女士没有履约按时交房，“房子不是她说能交接就交接的，必须双方碰面认可，一切都要按照签订的合同来办事”。记者提出，当事人无法严格依照合同条款交房，也是出于疫情等不可抗力因素，能不能从租客角度出发，不再追责索赔。对此，高经理不以为然，坚持认为：疫情期间二房东也蒙受了损失，现在房子租不出去，陆女士必须为此承担责任。目前已将此事交由公司法务处理，会通过法律途径解决。    律师：租客请求合理    为此，记者咨询了上海善法律师事务所高级合伙人秦裕斌。秦律师认为，疫情原因，无法及时地将房屋内物品搬离，属合理请求。如房东和中介以此为由，拒绝退还押金及主张违约金的行为，于法无据。这种情况下，虽然房东拒绝接受房屋，但理应视作承租人已经交还房屋，且可以要求退还押金。    秦裕斌建议，承租人在签订《租赁合同》时，可以在合同中添加对于不可抗力导致无法及时搬离房屋的处理细则，以便遇到类似情形，可以依据合同解决。    疫情之下，中介和二房东到底有没有向租客“转嫁损失”？陆女士到底该不该为此付出代价？本报将继续关注。本报记者  徐驰    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月28日11时至5月29日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求107件，其中紧急类诉求73件，已推动解决52件（含“公益联盟”16件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/5.htm,5/29/22,第5版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,这是对华不寻求“新冷战”？,王毅刚抵太平洋岛国，美国搞起小动作,    不寻求同中国发生“新冷战”，是美国国务卿布林肯在26日的对华政策演讲中明确的表述。然而，当地时间27日，白宫突然宣布，斐济将成为第14个加入“印太经济框架”（IPEF）的国家。    目前，中国国务委员兼外长王毅正在访问太平洋岛国，而“印太经济框架”的政治性世人皆知。布林肯的话，到底作数吗？    斐济  被美澳强行捆绑    26日，国务委员兼外长王毅开启了对太平洋岛国和东帝汶的访问，并将在斐济主持第二次中国-太平洋岛国外长会。    这本是国与国之间的正常交往，但美澳等国却如临大敌。26日，刚上台一周的澳大利亚外长黄英贤突然飞抵斐济。之后，美国率先宣布斐济将成为第一个加入IPEF的太平洋岛国。    美澳等国的霸道、自私与傲慢，尽显于此：    一方面，斐济加入IPEF与否，决定权在于自身。斐济还没表态，美国却着急宣布，考虑到两国间的历史交往与实力差距，这与强行捆绑何异？    另一方面，布林肯刚口口声声称不寻求与中国发生“新冷战”，却妄图阻挠别国与中国的正常交往，此举与筑起又一道“铁幕”何异？    任凭布林肯话说得再漂亮，美澳媒体对其“稳固后院的紧急行动”的评价，已完全反映了其根深蒂固的冷战思维。美国贸易代表戴琪20日曾公开声称，IPEF是为了反制中国在该地区的影响力。    新马  划阵营没好结果    对于美国对华说一套做一套的套路，不少亚太地区国家看得非常清楚。    27日，马来西亚前总理马哈蒂尔在东京出席第27届国际交流会议“亚洲的未来”期间，表示IPEF把中国排除在外，“这是一个非常错误的态度”。如果美国真心诚意地希望促进地区的增长和繁荣，就应该邀请中国也加入该框架之中。    马哈蒂尔强调，中国并未对美国采取非常“好战性”的行动，反而是美国不断向中国挥舞“制裁大棒”，并限制别国同中国发展贸易。任何排除中国的贸易联盟，都不利于加强“印太地区”多边贸易合作。    无独有偶，新加坡总理李显龙在“亚洲的未来”发表演讲时表示，美中两国关系的困难将直接影响亚太地区。如果亚洲国家分裂成两个阵营，将不会有好结果。    李显龙还表示，中国在亚洲的经济影响力让地区获益匪浅。中国一直参与亚太地区事务，提出“一带一路”倡议和全球发展倡议。新加坡支持这些倡议，也是“全球发展倡议之友小组”成员。    对于IPEF，李显龙认为它无法替代“全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定”（CPTPP），并表示新加坡欢迎中国加入后者。    中方  我们将拭目以待    布林肯发表演讲后，中国予以强硬回击。    26日，王毅在所罗门群岛访问时表示，太平洋岛国都是主权独立国家，不是谁家的“后院”；都有权做出自己的选择，而不是做别人的附庸。    外交部部长助理、发言人华春莹27日晚在其个人社交平台推特上11连发，对布林肯讲话内容进行“点对点”回击。华春莹表示，布林肯的讲话听起来更像是针对中国发起全面战略竞争或战争的宣言。至于“美国愿意同中国开展建设性接触，中美可以和平共处”，事实胜于雄辩，对于布林肯在演讲中的这些承诺，我们将拭目以待。    本报记者  杨一帆,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/6.htm,5/29/22,第6版:综合新闻/公告,,False
,鲥鱼及“三五恨”,,    何华    和几位朋友聚餐，聊到鲥鱼。鲥鱼，一向名贵，以大为美。不少故事提到“下面人”为了巴结权贵，将获得的特大鲥鱼“进贡”奸臣严嵩（或贾似道之流），管家让送礼者把鱼直接搬进厨房，送礼者沾沾自喜，但到了厨房一看，傻眼了，别人送来的鲥鱼，每一条都比自己的大。    我的祖籍富阳边上的富春江及长江（镇江段）所产鲥鱼味美绝伦，但现在几乎吃不到了。鲥，音时，说明它有时间性，只在端阳节之前出现。此鱼出水就死，不能搁置。一天色变；二天香变；三天味变，不能吃了。新马一带吃的鲥鱼叫“刺壳”，多产自缅甸、孟加拉。有次蔡澜先生来新，在某餐馆吃饭，老板殷勤，上了“刺壳”，蔡澜开口就说“假鲥鱼”。实际上，不能称“刺壳”为假鲥鱼，它是鲥鱼家族的一种，虽没有长江和富春江鲥鱼珍贵，但也非常鲜美，价格不菲。我一位食家朋友，非常喜欢“刺壳”，他认为比天价的“忘不了”鱼（产自砂拉越）更加鲜美。他的原话：吃了“刺壳”才真正忘不了。我相信这位食家的口味和品位。    《金瓶梅》里写到“糟鲥鱼”，把鲥鱼拿来糟了吃，似乎有点糟蹋，浓郁的糟味掩盖了鲥鱼的清甜本味，《金瓶梅》里的饮食到底不如《红楼梦》。《红楼梦》里也有糟货，但糟的是鹅掌鸭信，这就对了。    刘宝瑞的单口相声至今没人超越，他有“单口大王”之称。《珍珠翡翠白玉汤》《连升三级》《黄半仙》等经典段子百听不厌。刘先生有个名段《官场斗》，说和珅和刘罗锅之间的明争暗斗，其中有一节“圣宴争鱼”。乾隆特别爱吃鲥鱼，每年端午前，从镇江“快递”鲥鱼到京，可镇江离北京两千多里，那年头，又没火车，又没飞机。二十里为一驿站，夜悬灯，日挂旗，逐站接应，飞马传递。一天一夜时间就到北京了。这快马加鞭的节奏，和杨贵妃吃岭南荔枝有一比。这一年镇江贡来的鲥鱼，从中挑选出三条最新鲜，没有变色的，一尾奉献太后，一尾乾隆自用，剩下一尾赐给和珅刘墉分食。刘墉用计，令和珅抢去鱼头，自己得了美味的鱼身。    饭桌上，大家由鲥鱼又聊到“三恨”，其实三恨源于宋人的“五恨”。宋朝僧人惠洪（俗家姓彭）有一本《冷斋夜话》，书里提到他的叔叔彭渊材有“五恨”：“一恨鲥鱼多骨，二恨金橘带酸，三恨莼菜性冷，四恨海棠无香，五恨曾子固不能诗。”现在想想金橘带酸、莼菜性冷，也谈不上什么恨不恨的，那是彭渊材的个人爱恨，没有普遍意义。曾巩文章写得好，入了唐宋八大家，他不善作诗也没关系吧。张爱玲三恨中的两恨（鲥鱼多刺、海棠无香）来自这里，她又加了一恨“红楼未完”。    中国文字很是微妙，这里的恨其实就是憾恨，不是憎恨，而且重点落在憾字上。生活中，我们常常把“憾”升级为“恨”，这就不好了。憾，在所难免；恨，尽量化解。其实，所有的恨，都应该转为憾恨。这样的话，世界就只有反省，太平无事了。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/7.htm,5/29/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,囤物基因,,    潘真    杰克·伦敦小说《热爱生命》的主人公，受伤后独自穿越荒原，与遭遇的病狼搏斗，喝狼血充饥……终于被科考队救上船，吃饱喝足乃至一天天发胖，却无时不担心船上粮食不够吃，问水手讨来的硬面包塞满了船舱。饿昏过的人，即使吃饱了，他的精神仍然饥饿啊，他得防备可能发生的下一次饥荒！    年少时读这个中篇，不具备同理心，只当扣人心弦的文学作品欣赏。    后来，自助餐传入上海，我的初次尝试因不愉快而至今历历在目。当天，会议一结束，就见不少与会者小跑着移步隔壁晚宴厅，呼啦涌上去先下手为强，铺了漂亮餐布的长条桌上顷刻光盘，人们手中的大餐盘则个个堆得小山一般。和我同坐在圆桌边等待取餐的小伙伴，幽幽地批了一道：“可怜都是挨过饿的，有饥饿基因呀！”饥饿基因？我的记忆回闪到杰克·伦敦，吃得发胖的主人公以及塞满船舱的硬面包。    上海封控中，微博上有人写：奶奶经常把晚辈们送给她的零食藏起来，藏到过期了变质了也舍不得吃，跟她说吃完了还可以买的，她却说谁知道哪天就没得买了呢。我想，写下这条微博的小辈，也只有到了物资储备不足的当下，才能体会奶奶的危机感于万一吧。    我们小区的团购进行得有条不紊，大家早已不缺生活物资了。一年轻邻居不好意思地坦白：“家里堆满了吃的用的，可我看见群里团购还是每次都参加，就怕又不够了……”也许是最初估计不足断过粮的，不然这么年轻哪会如此病态地囤物。囤物无节制，说明心中有阴影，是焦虑。    在楼微信群里，看见邻居与楼组长对话：“今天不用测抗原是吗？”“没有通知领检测材料。如果有检测愿望，我马上去问。”“并没有。只是突然不做有点不适应。”我感觉不大好。    其实，抗疫到现在，我已经不惧病毒了，怕的倒是封控之后暴露出来的种种社会问题。要是我们不能够从危机中汲取教训，社会非但不进步反而严重倒退，那就难保将来不会重蹈覆辙。    抖音上，好多外埠同胞拿上海封控说事。有人发布了早期食品短缺的素材，指导上海人，以后学学北方人囤大白菜过冬，多囤点蔬菜，别老想着吃新鲜的。下面甚至有评论认为，老想着吃新鲜蔬菜，说明上海人太小资、太矫情。我看了，忍不住跟帖：待解封了，疫情过了，还是要天天买新鲜蔬菜吃，不能因为疫情败坏了生活品质。市场这么发达，物流这么通畅，凭什么不好好享受？让别人因你的享受，而有岗位、有生活。人人努力工作、体面生活的社会，才是正常的社会。    套用“饥饿基因”，大概也有“囤物基因”吧——囤物成习，终究会刻入基因，从而代代相传。后果不堪设想。我们，必  须对“囤物基因”说No！毕竟，这里是上海。不然，我们努力工作又为啥？,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-29/8.htm,5/29/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,重振经济“50条”措施发布,6月1日起取消复工复产审批制度,    本报讯（记者  叶薇）上海市疫情防控工作取得重要阶段性成效。昨天，《上海市加快经济恢复和重振行动方案》制定发布，全力落实中央部署，保企业、保就业，努力稳住经济基本盘。    市委常委、常务副市长吴清在昨天下午举行的第199场新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会上介绍，《行动方案》共包括八个方面、50条政策措施，主要分四大板块。    ■全力助企纾困  综合实施“缓免减退补”政策，多管齐下为企减负。在缓缴方面，餐饮、零售、旅游、民航、公路水路铁路运输等5个特困行业以及受疫情影响经营困难的中小微企业和个体工商户可缓缴社会保险费，用人单位可申请缓缴住房公积金，纳税人可延期纳税申报或申请延期缴纳税款。在减免方面，除减免房租外，对符合条件的企业减免房产税和城镇土地使用税，对非居民用户给予3个月应缴水费、电费、天然气费10%的财政补贴，免收3个月单位生活垃圾处理费等。在退税和补贴方面，在更多行业实施增值税存量和增量全额留抵退税，对餐饮、零售、旅游、交通运输、文体娱乐、住宿、会展等困难行业企业给予一次性稳岗补贴，对符合条件的用人单位给予一次性吸纳就业补贴。    ■复工复产复市  6月1日起取消企业复工复产审批制度、扩大企业防疫和消杀补贴范围、建立长三角产业链供应链互保机制、畅通国内国际物流运输通道等政策措施，支持各行业领域复工复产复市，稳步提高企业达产率。    ■稳外资外贸、促消费投资  提前启动2022年上海市鼓励跨国公司地区总部发展专项资金申报工作，进一步支持跨国公司在沪设立地区总部和外资研发中心；加大出口退税、出口信用保险等支持力度，鼓励港航企业减免货物堆存费和滞箱费；年内新增非营业性客车牌照额度4万个，阶段性减征部分乘用车购置税，对置换纯电动汽车的个人消费者给予一次性10000元补贴；年内完成中心城区成片旧区改造，年内新启动8个以上城中村改造项目；全力推动在建项目复工复产和新项目开工建设，支持扩大企业债券申报和发行规模等。    ■强化支撑保障  支持中小微企业无缝续贷；将商业汇票承兑期限由1年缩短至6个月，对民营企业债券融资交易费用能免尽免；降低市区两级政策性融资担保费率，实行贴息贴费政策。保障土地要素供给，尽快启动土地市场交易，增加年度建设用地计划。在民生保障方面，多渠道稳定和扩大就业，加大培训补贴力度；通过发放一次性补贴、爱心礼包等形式，保障困难群众生活。    市政府副秘书长、市发展改革委主任华源介绍，本轮《行动方案》提出的政策措施叠加3月底市政府出台上轮“21条”政策，预计全年将为市场主体减负各类资金规模达到3000亿元以上。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-30/3.htm,5/30/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False
,“一码通行”便捷“纸码通行”贴心,,    地铁过闸机    场所码+乘车码二合一    本报讯（记者  任天宝）过地铁安检要验“场所码”，过闸机又要换个App扫乘车码？5月30日开始，只需使用最新版“Metro大都会”App，就可以一屏展示“核酸检测”+“健康码”状态，验码通过后直接扫码进站，既不用切换App，也不用扫站内的“场所码”，乘客在扫码进站的过程中就能自动完成信息上传并形成溯源。    自5月22日上海地铁逐步恢复运营以来，有乘客反映手机来回切换太麻烦。为了解决这个痛点，上海地铁和市有关单位合作，打通防疫数据交互通道，利用技术手段升级“Metro大都会”App。为保护乘客隐私，“Metro大都会”仅会在得到用户实名认证并授权后才会关联相关防疫健康信息，且信息数据仅做展示，不在本地保留数据。    5月30日起，上海地铁将在运营的轨交3、6、10、16号线站点中，率先推出“一码通行”功能试点。需要注意的是，5月30日至31日，乘坐上海地铁仍须持有48小时内核酸阴性证明。    在此期间如果发现问题，可通过上海地铁客服热线（64370000-8-1）反馈。后续，上海地铁运营方将根据线路开通情况、系统运行效果和乘客体验反馈等，逐步在全网络推行。    没智能手机    纸质随申码+身份证自由行    本报讯（记者  解敏）当前，扫“场所码”或“数字哨兵”成为市民进入公共场所和居民小区的“标配”，没有智能手机的老年人和小孩又该如何顺利“扫码通行”？记者今日从上海市大数据中心了解到，对于无法扫码、亮码的市民，目前可通过纸质离线“随申码”+身份证的方案，来进行出行健康核验和场所登记。    18周岁以下未成年人、60周岁以上老人及本市户籍持证残障人士，可凭身份证、“随申码”、亲属“随申码”中任意一个，至各区行政服务中心、社区事务受理服务中心，以及部分提供“一网通办”自助服务终端的银行线下网点，在自助终端机自行申领并打印。有效期为180天，过期失效，需重新领取。委托人也可携带申领人的身份证代为办理。    后续还将加快开发线上申领功能。记者了解到，目前，全市离线“随申码”的申领已超过44.3万张。    老人、小孩若单独出行，须随身携带身份证+纸质离线“随申码”。在已部署“数字哨兵”的场所可刷身份证通行，“数字哨兵”设备将从后台实时获取健康核验数据，并自动完成信息登记。在未部署“数字哨兵”的场所，须出示本人身份证和纸质离线“随申码”，由场所工作人员确认身份后，用手机“随申办”移动端，扫描市民的纸质离线“随申码”，核验健康状态，并人工登记信息。    在有家人陪伴出行的情况下，家人可以在出行前，在本人“随申办”为老人、孩子提前申请亲属“随申码”。在已部署“数字哨兵”的场所，可以直接通过设备读取亲属“随申码”通行；在未部署“数字哨兵”的场所，由家人出示亲属“随申码”，工作人员查验后，人工登记信息后通行。    此外，针对老人外出乘坐公交地铁的需求，目前，交通卡公司已启动交通卡持有人信息关联绑定、查验纸质核酸阴性证明等方式，为老年群体提供交通出行方案。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-30/4.htm,5/30/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
张江科学城,最大药厂“救命药”生产不停,,    本报讯（记者  宋宁华）“本轮疫情发生后，企业生产没有中断，其中包括救命药和新冠疫苗等。”今天，记者从位于张江创新药产业基地新场片区的上海天慈国际药业有限公司（以下简称“天慈国际”）获悉，在张江科学城占地面积最大的创新药工厂里，多款代表中国创新高度的药品从这里走出。截至昨天，天慈园区已复工返岗人员178人，加上疫情封控前留守的人员，目前驻园人数和产能已超过平时的一半。    天慈国际园区落户新场镇8年，占地面积211亩，采用独创的共享制药模式将众多知名创新药生产企业凝聚在一起。“复星凯特的中国首款获批上市的CAR-T细胞治疗产品是淋巴瘤患者的‘救命药’。区别于传统药物，CAR-T细胞疗法是个性化、定制化药品，每个患者都是一个单独的生产批次，这款药是没有库存的，工厂必须确保全过程不间断生产；多生产一批，就能多挽救一名患者。”天慈国际副总经理池王胄告诉记者。晟斯生物的首款创新药长效重组凝血八因子已申请上市，可以改变许多血友病家庭的命运，第二款创新药也已获批进入临床试验，亟需完成生产车间建设。此外，斯微生物自主研发的新冠病毒mRNA（信使核糖核酸）疫苗于4月29日获得国家药监局批准，将开展临床试验，急需临床样品生产制备。    这些入驻企业的生产需求迫切，加上天慈国际自主研发的可用于治疗新冠病毒引起的血栓症状的创新药3期临床试验和生产筹备工作也亟需开展。4月中旬，天慈国际成为上海市首批复工复产市重点“白名单”企业。之后，晟斯生物成为浦东新区建筑工地复工复产第一批白名单企业。    4月28日首批复工人员进入园区，天慈国际当即决定园区进入“双闭环”管理模式，即园区继续执行全封闭管理杜绝外来风险，园区内部以公司为单位实施“气泡式管理”，设置警戒线并提供24小时安保服务，从而避免人员交叉的风险。    据了解，药品生产的三大核心要素：专业技术人员、高精尖设备、原辅料供应。园区内各企业的员工类型较为多元化，有科学家、生产工程师、管理人员、建筑施工人员等。复工复产后，食堂不但要做好一日三餐的准时准点供应，更是尽力满足客户各种个性化需求。“行军床、睡袋、洗漱用品、消毒剂、防护服、饮料、零食、牛奶、水果……”园区自营超市源源不断的物资供应，让大家安心复工复产。    园区安全生产的关键因素是设备安全。受疫情影响，原有的设备维保单位暂停了上门服务。为此，园区自有工程团队全部驻守岗位，撸起袖子自己干，2个月内先后抢修电力、水系统、空调等生产设备数十次，排除多次安全生产风险。    大家夜以继日付出，保障了张江创新药的生产，迄今为止该园区保持着“零感染”和“零事故”。“目前在园区内有1个临时核酸采样点。未来疫情常态化后，我们计划在园区门口设置常态化的核酸采样点。充分发挥张江核酸检测机构较多的优势，现在我们正在培训园区的采样员，方便企业顺利复工复产。”池王胄介绍，园区内多为生产型企业，高功率设备需要每个月维修保养，一旦出故障影响很大。目前物流不畅等因素仍影响到生产物料的供应、设备维修检测力量不足，希望尽快打通复工复产的“堵点”。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-30/5.htm,5/30/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
复工在即，“沉睡”的车子连连“趴窝”,搭电消毒换备胎  紧急维修送上门,,    复工、返乡、治病、配药……随着疫情防控形势不断向好，不少小区封闭许久的大门渐渐打开。但“沉睡”数月久未舒展筋骨的车子，在被“唤醒”后立刻“趴窝”，硬生生拖了出门的后腿！电瓶缺电、轮胎亏气、车辆无法启动……连日来，不少市民向“新民帮侬忙”发来紧急求助。记者随即在“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟群中发布信息，公益企业途虎养车迅速“接单”——“这件事，就交给我们了！”    从早忙到深夜    熟悉的上海要回来了    家住普陀区桃浦路的朱女士在小区开具通行证明后，急着赶往医院配药，但车子就是发动不起来，眼看将错过预约门诊时间，愁得不知道如何是好。接到求助后，途虎养车工作人员通过电话问询，初步判断可能汽车电瓶坏了。他们穿上防护服、拿上工具，立刻赶到朱女士小区，为车辆更换了电瓶。“真是救急！车子一修好，我就开到医院配好了药，否则真是要耽误大事情了……”回访中，朱女士连声称谢。    这两天，家住闵行区沪青平公路180弄的朱先生也是伤透了脑筋。他的奥迪车发动机亮起黄灯，驾驶系统和启停系统也都出现故障，“我马上就要复工了，车子动不了，这可怎么办啊？！”在得知朱先生的烦恼后，途虎养车迅速派人赶到现场，经检查，故障系车辆节温器损坏，但该零件目前缺货。工作人员一方面紧急联系车辆送朱先生复工，一方面迅速联系供应商采购零件，“车子一修好，就给您送过来”。听到工作人员这样的承诺后，朱先生吃下了“定心丸”。    疫情初期，途虎养车主要为保供车辆提供维修服务。近来，随着上海部分区域有序开放私家车上路，报修量直线上升。应急救援队队长王辉告诉新民晚报“新民帮侬忙”记者，最近一周，他和小伙伴们从清晨五六时一直要忙到深夜才能“收工”，“虽然累点苦点，但看着路上的车子一天天多起来，感觉熟悉的上海就要回来了！”    公益行动启动    为复工返岗保驾护航    复工复产了，车子上路了，问题都来了——别着急，阿拉来帮忙了！针对市民遇到的出行烦恼，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”将与途虎养车共同启动“紧急维修公益行动”，为复工返岗、求医配药等保驾护航。    3公里内免费上门搭电、3公里内免费更换备胎、免费车内消毒杀菌——途虎养车已开通紧急救援热线：4001118895，专业团队将以在线响应、配套上门服务的方式，受理各类咨询和预约。    同时，市民还可以打开今日头条“新民帮侬忙”《急煞急煞！复工返岗，车子连连“趴窝”！紧急救援公益礼包，来了来了》推文中，点击进入途虎养车·新民帮侬忙上海复工专题页，领取各项权益，礼包限量500份。领券完成后，待工场店复工，即可预约下单，与门店联系申请技师上门服务。各区域工场店的恢复营业时间，将以所在街道发布的疫情防控要求为准。    本报记者  房浩,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-30/6.htm,5/30/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False

,鳝背鳝肚都是肉,,    沈嘉禄    疫情期间，错过了清明团、麦芽饼、枇杷、梅子、豌豆尖、头刀韭、二月蚬、桃花鳜、菜花鳖，解封后可不能错过端午粽、酒酿饼和樱桃、青梅了，还有凤尾鱼、塘鳢鱼、太湖三白、小龙虾。你看，黄鳝正在摇头摆尾呢！    沪埠素有“小暑黄鳝赛人参”一说。逢熟吃熟，本是饭稻羹鱼的江南黎民给自己寻找的饕餮理由。入夏后，黄鳝肉质最是肥美，此时不吃，更待何时？上海人吃黄鳝，除了本帮的响油鳝糊、五花肉烧鳝筒、咸肉鳝筒汤、鳝丝蛋花羹，还有苏锡菜、淮扬菜里的梁溪脆鳝、生爆鳝背、炝虎尾、炒软兜等。杭州奎元馆的虾爆鳝也不错，过桥制式，一半过酒，一半浇面；数年前在千灯古镇吃到一盆香菜梗炒鳝丝，有郇厨之妙。    等大热天辣豁豁地降临，上海人就吃冷面配冰冻绿豆汤，鳝丝冷面你难道不想吗？    黄鳝在中国人的饮食史中很早就现身了，《诗经》中有“匪鳣匪鲔，潜逃于渊”的描述，有人认为鲔就是鲟鱼，但也有人考证为鳝鱼。不过“潜逃于渊”倒跟黄鳝的习性很像，是世代相传的生存法则。黄庭坚在他《戏答史应之三首》中明明白白写到了黄鳝：“岁晚亦无鸡可割，庖蛙煎鳝荐松醪”，这种情况下，田鸡和黄鳝就成了替代品，味道想必不差，配松花酒刚刚好。    姚慕双、周柏春的独脚戏《学英语》让人笑破肚皮，姚老师说外国人不吃黄鳝，英语没有“黄鳝”这个词，他发明的“洋泾浜”叫“捏不牢滑脱”，上海人都懂的。    王安忆在长篇小说《一把刀，千个字》中写到扬州人划鳝丝，“一根竹篾子，削薄了……篾片子从头到梢，转眼就是一堆。”这情景在镇扬等地的菜场里还能见到，上海人划鳝丝用牙刷柄，差的不只技术，还有情调。    有一次苏州美食大咖华永根先生请国斌兄与我在太监弄新聚丰吃饭，席中有一盆清炒鳝糊，倾国倾城，无懈可击。华先生说：“苏帮菜厨师对鳝鱼颇多讲究，清炒鳝糊的鳝丝需现划、现烧、现吃，一气呵成。调料多达十余种，油也分三种：煸炒鳝丝用猪油，烧沸时加点菜油，收稠时淋些麻油。服务员候在灶台边，头灶师傅热油一浇，她就飞快地端到你面前，一路上嗞嗞作响。”    不过最好的黄鳝肴还是在淮扬。汪曾祺在《鱼我所欲也》一文中写道：“淮安人能做全鳝席，一桌子菜，全是鳝鱼。除了烤鳝背、炝虎尾等等名堂，主要的做法一是炒，二是烧。鳝鱼烫熟切丝再炒，叫作‘软兜’；生炒叫炒脆鳝。红烧鳝段叫‘火烧马鞍桥’，更粗的鳝段‘焖张飞’。制鳝鱼都要下大量姜蒜，上桌后撒胡椒，不厌其多。”    炝虎尾是“水淹七军”，厨师取鳝鱼尾部一段约四寸长的净肉（俗称虎尾），锅里清水加姜片葱结和绍酒米醋烧开，鳝丝汆熟捞起，加卤汁一拌而成，兜头浇一勺蒜油，撒胡椒粉后趁热吃，鲜嫩香软，四美并举。    炒软兜颇有乡土风情，厨师专选“笔杆青”，只取双背肉，掐成半尺来长，焯水后捞起沥干。用熟猪油煸炒葱姜蒜末出香，投入鳝段翻炒几下，投入调味料，转中火“烤”一会。待卤汁全部兜上后，淋熟猪油推匀，起锅装盆。吃到一半时若再加点用鸡汤煨过的淮阴宽条线粉，就是软兜带粉。    炒软兜是“火烧赤壁”，重在火功。去年初夏在影城对面一家饭店吃炒软兜，厨师当着客人的面打火坐灶翻炒收汁，香气四溢，声动十里，鳝肉软糯而有适当弹性，鳝皮滑溜溜的口感奇妙。软兜炒好，我才相信淮扬菜“前度刘郎今又来”。    也是去年吃杨梅的时候，与国斌兄一起去苏州吴江宾馆看望在那里研发江南运河宴的徐鹤峰大师，大师以红烧马鞍桥、明月炖生敲、蒜蓉鳝卷等鳝鱼名肴优待，贪吃的我还请他做了一道白煨脐门。    所谓脐门，特指鳝鱼的腹部肉，因靠近泄殖孔而特别柔软，一条重约400克的黄鳝才能取三寸长的一段，做一道白煨脐门需要二十多条大黄鳝。炝虎尾、炒软兜用的是鳝背，鳝腹若何“千年走一回”，就靠煨脐门出圈。    借得宜兴砂锅一具，最好满身油垢，鳝腹经过汆、烫、煨等多道程序烹制而成，金蒜要多，白酱油、白醋、白胡椒不可少，成菜宽汤，色白似乳，糯香酥软，回味无穷。白煨脐门是两淮鳝鱼宴的招牌菜。    白煨脐门在一般菜谱里已经“失踪”，在上世纪五十年代由上海市政府机关事务管理局主编的《菜谱集锦》里倒是有记载——哈哈，这本书的执行主编是沈京似先生，天王级的美食大咖。领略了这道江南珍馐，不得不叹服淮扬厨师对黄鳝这一食材的深刻理解与完善呈现。欧美人不吃“捏不牢滑脱”，米其林美食侦探恐怕也不识此中三昧，洋盘的损失大了去啦！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-30/8.htm,5/30/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

瑞金二路街道社区卫生服务中心线下门诊服务恢复,患者来为疫情期间药物结账,,    本报讯（记者  郜阳）随着全市复工复产步伐的加快，因疫情受到影响的就医需求也逐步释放。昨天，地处徐汇、静安、黄浦三区交界的瑞金二路街道社区卫生服务中心恢复线下门诊服务。记者在现场看到，入院患者需提前预约，并通过数字哨兵核验。在中心布置的简易门诊里，接诊医生间隔坐开，患者单向进出，“不走回头路”。    经过一上午的调整、检查，瑞金二路街道社区卫生服务中心于昨天下午2时许迎回了老熟人。患者陈阿姨早早等候在了中心的门诊大厅门口，“听说社区卫生服务中心开诊了，我赶紧通过居委会预约，要来谢谢在两个月的封控时间里，一直与我微信和电话联系的马婕医生。”原来，陈阿姨患有糖尿病，平常需要胰岛素注射治疗，但在封控期间所用的胰岛素没有了，这可急坏了她。陈阿姨第一时间求助自己的家庭医生马婕，可医院药房库存也耗尽，什么时候才能补充也要看物流。“我突然想到，分中心还有几支备用的胰岛素，于是连夜骑车把备用胰岛素取回来，通过居委志愿者把胰岛素送到陈阿姨手中。”马婕回忆。    线下门诊恢复服务后，陈阿姨一来为之前送到家里的药物结账，二来想当面感谢家庭医生。瑞金二路街道社区卫生服务中心主任缪皓霞告诉记者，疫情期间，中心“借”出了大量居民急需的药物。“我们建立了微信群，主动与周边16个居委会对接。居委会告知我们居民的配药需求后，我们就会打包好，交给志愿者带回小区。”缪皓霞说，“这两天预约前来的居民中，除了为家中老人配药外，不少是来为之前的药物结账的。”截至5月30日，中心共开具转运单350余张，接听医疗服务热线2500余次；开出简易门诊处方1.2万余张，代配药1.3万余次，多方联动解决2000余人次的医疗需求。    据悉，瑞金二路街道社区卫生服务中心将在6月上旬通过线上预约方式，合理分配号源，控制时间段，提供全科以及中医全科医疗服务；此后开设必要的辅助检查科室，力争尽早全面恢复各项门诊业务工作。“我们会积极应对疫情形势好转后出现的就医需求增加、就医负荷加重等情况，统筹做好疫情防控和医疗服务工作，保障社区基本医疗服务逐步恢复。”缪皓霞表示。    线下开诊前，中心已经完成了科室内自查、院感科抽查、院领导督查的三级院感巡查制度，严格落实院感各项制度力度不减，持续加强公共区域的消杀和通风工作，保障群众就医安全。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/4.htm,5/31/22,第4版:上海新闻,,False
,气温高位运行  昨天有望入夏,,    本报讯（记者  马丹）暂别雨水，阳光重返主场。今天申城气温仍在高位运行，最高气温直奔28℃而去。据上海中心气象台消息，昨天上海发起了气象意义的入夏冲刺，日均气温也已满足大于等于22℃的标准，而包括今天在内的未来四天，日均气温达到入夏标准并非难事，因此，天气趋势已经“坚定”地预告——上海气象意义的夏天已经来了，5月30日将有望成为今年的入夏日。    气象资料显示，上海常年平均的入夏时间为5月24日。近几年，夏天来得都偏早，特别是去年，5月7日就早早入了夏。相对而言，今年的夏天来得略晚了些。    明天开始，申城市民将逐步复工复产，而雨水也会频繁来凑热闹。据预报，由于西南暖湿气流旺盛，未来一段时间雨水几乎天天见，但多以阵性降水为主，气温总体比较平稳，最高气温在26℃~29℃，最低气温在21℃~23℃。    这几天，湿度较高、颇为闷热，不少市民问：是不是上海的黄梅天也同步到来？市气象局首席服务官邬锐说，梅雨季节尚未到来。尽管近日雨水不少，体感很“梅雨”，这和全天湿度大、气压偏低有关，人会感觉闷闷的。“但是，判定入梅也有一定的气象学标准，近日的降水不是由梅雨天气产生的。”,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/5.htm,5/31/22,第5版:上海新闻,,False
孝顺晚辈不想让偏瘫外婆和老母亲太辛苦　公益联盟和小区齐心完成“最难运送”,门店安装保安帮抬  “完整”护理床终进家门,,    求助    我的外婆今年94岁，住在长宁区富贵东路229弄。4月29日，因突然中风偏瘫。经综合评估后，老人被接回家中休养。尽管母亲和外婆同住，但她毕竟也是63岁的人了，每天为老人端茶送饭、接尿翻身，累得筋疲力尽。由于小区封控，我一直无法赶去帮忙，在家里急得团团转。我现在急求一张护理床，能让外婆躺着舒服点，让母亲也少点操劳。    市民  刘先生    帮忙>>>    二老吃苦晚辈心酸    记者了解到，刘先生的外婆在被送往复旦大学附属华山医院急救后，由于疫情原因，刘先生的母亲考虑再三后还是将老人接回家中照料。现在老人稍微动一动，都需要女儿帮忙。每日里守在老人身边，时刻不停地照顾吃喝拉撒，对于刘先生63岁的母亲而言，也是心有余而力不足。“小区封控，想寻护工根本是勿可能的事情。外婆每次和我通电话，开口闭口就是‘让伊吃苦头了’，我因为无法出自家小区，无法现场帮忙，听了心里老酸的。”为了让外婆和母亲都能不太辛苦，他决定买张护理床，但四处询问后，很多厂家无奈表示“有货送不出”。    爱心接力抬床入门    万般无奈之下，刘先生向“战疫·帮侬忙”发出了求助。公益联盟平台工作人员胡琪立刻与公益企业百联旗下上海第一医药取得联系，电话那头立刻传来了好消息：“我们有货的，可以送上门！”正当刘先生喜出望外之际，一个大大的问号突然涌上心头，顿时让他又一次急得六神无主：护理床的所有配件能进门，但送货人员没法进门，母亲不会安装怎么办？！    “不要急，我们来想办法！”上海第一医药开始疫情中“最难运送”。工作人员在店内安装测试后，找来大车“整床”运送。在小区门口，多名保安闻讯赶来，轻抬、慢移、侧进，过一扇门就要反反复复试，费尽九牛二虎之力，终于将护理床送进老人家中。    “太不容易了，太不容易了！我现在真不知道该用怎样的语言表达自己的感激，只有把这份感恩一直放在心里。”在记者回访时，刘先生说话的声音一直在颤抖。    本报记者  王军    战疫·帮侬忙    诉求数报    5月30日11时至5月31日11时，新民晚报“战疫·帮侬忙”互助服务类融媒体平台共收到求助、咨询类等诉求62件，其中紧急类诉求35件，已推动解决28件（含“公益联盟”13件）。非紧急类诉求也已通过相关渠道给予回应。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/6.htm,5/31/22,第6版:战疫/帮侬忙,,False
,上海人走过的三个春天,,    何菲    成年人的内心有时是一口压力锅，一些潜在的欲望偶尔会通过限压阀悄悄跑出来。闭环四十天开始，我连续三夜在梦中出游，分别是北京、青田、张掖。那天清晨刚降落张掖机场，坐缆车为看到壮美的七彩丹霞欣喜若狂，就被从睡梦中叫醒：“做核酸啦！”    后来小区发放出门证，能骑着小黄车在街区溜达，给了我很大抚慰，有一次竟不知不觉骑行了24公里仍意犹未尽。道口有隔离带，有路障，但警察先生很Nice，亲切讲理，风度翩翩。车兜里装着可乐，初夏的风轻盈可人，法国梧桐看上去宛如巨大的莴笋，上海醒了，还未洗漱，但我的心渐渐晴朗起来。这座能从失败与成功中学到一样多的城市，文明的基因与自觉从未离开。    这两年多我离开上海的次数不算多，与疫情以前无法同日而语。这两年很多安排无法预设，常常被迫中断。却也并非全无裨益，因为我有更多精力与热情去领略本城各街区的边边角角。谁知道今天的因缘际会不会是明天的命运收获呢。    不少友人的状态也都发生了嬗变。2020年大年初四，新冠病毒在国内肆虐，开旅行社的好友林桑刚从日本回来，当即援助我20个N95口罩。我们从剑河路龙溪路一直走到虹桥路。他说这回他可能要休息三个月，樱花季这波生意恐怕错过了。转眼2022年，做了二十几年旅游生意的林桑已错过了三个樱花季，不得不暂时歇业改行。其间做过免税店化妆品代购、对日籍人士的房产中介服务等。这两年疫情干扰，但能比较健康愉快地活着，韬光养晦、保存实力，展望未来，也不失为积极的生活方式。如同恋爱，年轻人的是互相拥有，成年人只求互相拥有过。人生的乐趣多着呢。    一个有阵子没联络的女友力邀我上她的新媒体视频连线直播节目。她以前在电台做主播，有不少年，我经常在她的节目里当嘉宾坐谈风月。辞职后她自主创业，成为内容提供方，与多家平台合作。闲聊了一会儿，我突然想到问她：你现在直播室在哪儿？她笑了，说她家的红木书橱前就是她的直播间，顶上有几盏灯，可以把眼睛照得亮亮的，再开个美颜。“你看我直播效果漂亮吧？”    另有一些友人也都搭建了微信购物群或担任分销。有用没用的，我也会参团买一些作为对他们创收的支持。家里囤了不少东西，大多是没见过的品牌和代工厂货，品质却不俗。它们在上海闭环的几十天间，也都发挥了作用。    前几天，我和从小一起长大的表弟间爆发了我们成人以后第一次正式的争论。我们的争论虽然言语知性，相对克制，但谁也不会被谁说服，辩论的最后，是祝福各自的城市在遭遇无法预判的风险时，从容地顺势而为闯过难关。在低处辩论，在高处握手，才是成年人的友谊吧。想到一句诗“爱是知道、照亮，但更深刻的爱，保存在黑暗中，像那些你知道不能和不能知道的事物。”    在静默的日子里，有时会想到在我二三十岁时，上海很多人都像打鸡血般，在全球化进程中努力地自我实现，为行业创造一个又一个奇迹。疫情增加了未来的不确定性，尽管原有的秩序运转逻辑被不同程度改变，上海人却依然从容得体、温暖有序，没有哗众取宠，也没有文明降维。这样的城市和它的子民，自开埠至今始终默默地励精图治，值得被尊敬并祝福。    这几日，我与几个好友会畅想在生活恢复正常以后一起去哪儿转转，大家首选外滩陈毅广场。1949年5月27日上海解放，从陈毅率十万解放军大军冒雨露宿街头开始，上海人民就对政府有了高度的信任。我们想去听一下海关大楼的钟声。它的每一次敲响都昭示了上海的声音、觉醒和力量，其变迁筚路蓝缕，向海而生，早已连接成了一条通向现代化国际化的必经之路。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/7.htm,5/31/22,第7版:夜光杯,,False
,映日红花送严翔,,"    汪正煜    农历已经过了小满，应该快到炎热的夏天了，可是有时还会感到寒意，并非因为疫情，而是这些日子常为一些艺术家的离去而伤感。那天傍晚，又听说我敬爱的严翔老师走了，简直不敢相信。这是一位我在学生时代就仰慕的表演艺术家啊！    我从小爱好戏剧。每月不多的零花钱，只肯用在看戏买书上，大世界是常去之处，当时门票每张一毛钱。长江剧场的话剧也常看，在门口等退票，临开场时，一两毛钱就能等到前排座位。上海人艺话剧演员中我崇拜的有高崇实、江俊和严翔等几位。我在执导电视剧《蓝盾上的国徽》时，请过江俊老师，而在电视剧《寻找明天的太阳》时和严翔老师有过难忘的合作。    《寻找明天的太阳》描写一位失去双肢的残疾人，顽强拼搏抗争命运，以脚画画，最终成为一位画家的故事。完全按真人真事改编，男主人公也由这位残疾人画家自己扮演。导演李歇浦。我忝任副导演兼演个小角色。严翔扮演党委书记一角。我看过他在话剧《日出》中演胡四，后来在电影中又看过他演李石清，两个性格迥然不同的人物，居然是同一个演员演的，令人惊叹。本剧中，他演一位谆谆关爱群众的书记。拍摄过程中，我亲身感受到严翔老师的仁爱之心。他当时已是声名卓著的大演员了，可与从未上过镜头的人对戏，毫不厌烦，反而帮着导演耐心解释辅导，让对方非常感动，也使戏得以顺利拍摄。剧中有些镜头还去上海油画院拍摄，当时画院的陈逸飞、夏葆元等大画家还没有出名，严翔老师和他们相见时如同老朋友，毫无名人架势。    严翔气质儒雅，演知识分子最合适，但演好每个角色，靠的不是本色，而是演技和认真执着的精神。我和严翔老师在电视剧《WP行动》中又有一次合作，他扮演国民党将领戴伟，我演国民党海军副司令段雨中，实际上是我党地下党员，领导了一次武装起义。上海人艺许多演员参加了演出，可谓明星云集，让我在参演时学到不少。演反一号乔林的是王诗槐，他和严翔本人的气质相近，可在此剧表演中却迥然相异，一个飞扬跋扈，一个沉稳儒雅，同是反派，性格不同，令我深感艺术作品中人物决不能“千人一面”矣！    我和严翔老师也有一次擦肩而过。有一次，上影朋友介绍我去试演孙中山。化了妆就与对手试戏，不料对手就是严翔。我也不知此剧写什么，背了台词就演，演毕，严翔摇摇头，严肃地说：“不行，小汪表演太过了。”导演问我：“你不是演过孙中山吗？”没有啊，在《孙中山与宋庆龄》里，我演的是宋耀如，他们搞错了。当然，这次合作不成，但我却一直记住严翔老师的话和严肃的眼神。是的，那眼神永远难忘！    《城南旧事》和《上海的早晨》是经典名作，严翔饰演的英子父亲，没有丝毫表演痕迹，表演炉火纯青；而广大观众又因徐义德一角认识了他，温文尔雅的外表、丰富的历练让他频频饰演“资本家”。他还在《黄齐生与王若飞》中，主演民主主义思想家、教育家黄齐生（王若飞的舅舅），又在《泣血年流》中，主演20年代末到30年代初沪上爱国民族资本家项松茂，演过古董商韩锡元（《佛光侠影》）、黄楚九（《上海大世界》）、华侨巨富李建南（《李建南》）等。斯坦尼斯拉夫体系认为，导演启发、发挥、发展了演员的创造性，而演员反过来又启发、发挥、发展了导演的创造性，严翔正是在演艺生涯中体现了这点。纵观平生，他演过100多位不同角色，对一位演员来说，夫复何求？此之谓福矣！    如今，严翔走了。今年春寒料峭，两个月来仙逝了几位艺术大师，可是，春天不会涂脂抹粉，否则她就永远不会苏醒，万紫千红过后，还会有“接天莲叶无穷碧,映日荷花别样红”的美好季节。在祛除魔障后的浦江两岸，已经看到夏日的美景。仅此，以映日红花送别严翔老师……",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-05-31/8.htm,5/31/22,第8版:夜光杯,,False

,熟悉的上海回来了,,    公交恢复  放下手机，望向车窗外熟悉街景    今天起，上海市域内公共交通有序恢复运行。地铁、公交纷纷恢复运行，为出行的乘客提供服务。    早上7时51分，在地铁上海火车站站，车站人流开始多了起来。张大志背着“大包小裹”踏上回乡的归程。“我一大早就从塘镇出发，来上海火车站坐高铁回老家，看看老人，看看孩子。”说话时，张大志的眉眼之间难掩喜色，和他一起结伴回去的还有两名工友，“等看过家人一定再回上海，继续打拼”。    记者在人民广场地铁站看到，每一个出入口处均张贴了“场所码”，出示“绿码”和72小时内核酸阴性证明即可进站，遇到不熟悉操作的乘客，身穿蓝马甲的志愿者会立即上前予以引导。    列车上，有人刷着手机，或站或坐，有人低着头闭目养神。    “今天早上最大的感受是，上海回来了！”乘客李女士表示，自己要去陆家嘴上班，本来对复工复产的第一天还有些后知后觉，直到在站里听到列车呼啸而过的声音，看到车厢内形形色色的乘客，这种感觉真是久违了。    20路电车拖着长长的“辫子”，慢悠悠地停靠在人民广场站点，十多名乘客正在翘首以盼。“来了来了，车子来了，外滩半日游开始！”赵阿姨和她的“老闺蜜”们对这一天期待已久，恢复出行的第一天，他们就打算乘坐20路到终点站，去看看心心念念的黄浦江。    一上车，车厢内已有四五名乘客。这一次，大家都放下了手机，默默望向窗外，看看往日熟悉的申城街景。    20路车队队长黄晓东告诉记者，今天相比以往最热闹的时候，人流量还是少了一些，但相信通过大家的努力，上海一定能够恢复往日的烟火气。    “阿姨你好，这边先坐下，稍后给您提供车厢二维码进行扫描”。中运量71路乘务员李燕最近的工作已恢复至常态水平，不同的是，每天增加了一项任务，那就是不厌其烦地为每一位老年乘客提供扫码服务。    5月22日复工以来，李燕在服务中发现，车辆的“场所码”张贴于车厢前后的玻璃上，一些老年人上车后需要站立扫码可能造成安全隐患。“我们车队为此专门制作了车厢‘场所码’的吊牌。”李燕说，她会主动走到已经落座的老年人身边，引导他们扫码。    根据计划，上海轨道交通全网络所有线路首末班车时间已恢复至常态水平。根据计划，上海轨道交通全网络所有线路首末班车时间将恢复至常态水平。需要注意的是，恢复基本运行的初期阶段，各线路列车最小行车间隔约5至10分钟，较以往有所延长。此外，2号线徐泾东站、虹桥火车站站、虹桥2号航站楼站，11号线花桥站、光明路站、兆丰路站、上海赛车场站仍暂停运营。    本报记者  任天宝    见证历史  跨越零点，外滩堵车高架也“红了”    昨天深夜11时43分，黄浦分局两位民警开始拆除南京东路口的隔离围栏。几分钟后，外滩陈毅广场通往江堤的5号口也被打开，早已等候多时的市民们欢呼着冲过中山东一路的斑马线，涌上亲水平台，对着黄浦江水和对岸夜色中的陆家嘴“三件套”又叫又跳，尽情地撒着欢。    “太开心了！”戴着头盔的朱先生举着手机，一边旋转着身子一边大叫，手机不停按下快门，嗓门大得让边上的保安不得不上前提醒。    “我这是太高兴了，闷了两个多月，不吼一下怎么行？”朱先生解释。他告诉记者，自己是做烟酒生意的，在北宝兴路开了家小店，关店两个多月让他颗粒无收，所以特别焦虑。“总算等到这天了。今天小区可以自由出入，我下午骑了辆电瓶车就出了门，漫无目的到处骑。后来想想，外滩是一定要来的。”    很多人和朱先生有同样的想法。“上海重启当然要有仪式感，外滩就是最好的地标。”家住乍浦路的徐先生是走路过来的，他把手机固定在自拍杆上，一路走一路拍。“都是平时看惯的风景，但这时候怎么也看不够，总感觉特别不一样。”    外滩亲水平台上的人越来越多。    认识的不认识的，大家都聚在一起合影。面对着镜头快门，人们不停发出热烈的欢呼声。不时有人高高跃起，跷着双手拇指大喊，“上海加油！”    跨越零点，边上的中山东一路上，车流不断攀升。很多车开过陈毅广场，都会放缓车速长鸣喇叭。喇叭声连成一片，久久不息。交通违法肯定不应提倡，但他们此刻的心情，上海人都能理解。    “外滩堵车了！”“南北高架也红了。”市民的热情让警察措手不及，不断增派警力加强疏导。    外滩治安派出所责任区队长钟强告诉记者，沉寂了两个多月的外滩终于又热闹了起来，说明上海抗疫已经取得了阶段性成果。“接下来马上是端午小长假，外滩客流很可能出现报复性反弹，我们会在大客流和防疫两方面都做好预案，加强现场提醒分流，保护好得来不易的抗疫成果。”    本报记者  潘高峰,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/3.htm,6/1/22,第3版:上海新闻,,False

,上海宁  100个普通人亲历的大上海保卫战,,    许多宏大的历史事件背后，个体的面目往往是模糊的。艰苦卓绝的大上海保卫战中，一个个在这个城市工作、学习、生活着的普通人，却如此光彩夺目。    疫情终将散去，悲伤痛苦也终会远离，但总有一些值得铭记的东西会留下来，成为历史车轮深深的辙痕，成为城市记忆浓墨重彩的一笔。多年之后，当我们可以平静回眸上海的这个春夏，大家一定会记得，那些平凡而鲜活的人物，那些质朴而高尚的品格，那些动人的故事，那些温暖的情感……    今天起，上海全面恢复生产生活秩序，步入“新常态”。为了纪念这个城市新的开始，更为了重新出发，我们回访了100位曾经报道过的普通人。    他们中，有坐镇定点医院重症监护室的医生，有武汉金银潭医院援沪的护士，有在电话里失声哭泣的居委书记，有帮邻居烧菜烧饭的上海阿姨，有开着三辆私家车24小时连轴转、送医配药发物资的新上海人，有每天5万步的蔬菜分拣员，有每天23小时“人车一体”的送货员，有跨江救急的“奶粉骑士”，有为女儿画春天的爸爸，有方舱声音武阿姨，有改编《蛤蜊炖蛋》童谣的音乐人……    历史会记住为这座城市坚守和付出的所有人。逆行者，坚守者，凡人英雄……无论我们用怎样的称呼，他们拥有一个共同的名字“上海宁”。他们是一线医务人员、社区工作者、公安干警、基层干部、下沉干部、志愿者、好邻居。日常生活里，他们可能会有这样那样的缺点，但灾难面前，危急关头，他们自尊自律，互帮互助，优雅善良，豁达包容，只为上海的安宁。    100之于2500万，分母太大，分子太小，肯定无法覆盖所有令人感动的人和事，但他们完全可以代表上海。因为在他们身上，有上海最美好的模样。我们不会忘记，也必须感激，最困难的时刻，是他们让大家得到帮助、萌生希望、感受力量，看到这座城市在沉默中依然有光。也是他们让我们始终坚信：有恐惧，就必然有无畏；有彷徨，就必然有坚守；有退缩，就必然有向前。    上海是一座人民城市。为人民，也靠人民。在这场艰难漫长的大仗、硬仗中，我们深深体会到这一点。当疫情退散，上海复苏，重整行装再出发，要走出艰难困境，走好未来的每一步，就必须秉持“人民至上”的初心，紧紧依靠人民群众，感恩人民的奉献，倾听人民的声音，善用人民的力量。    我们爱上海，我们都是上海宁。    潘高峰,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T1.htm,6/1/22,第T1版:特刊,,False
,抢救重症患者，与时间赛跑,,    皋源    上海交通大学医学院附属仁济医院重症医学科主任    抗疫让一大批中青年ICU医师快速成长，我坚信唯有坚持，方得始终！    作为新冠感染患者市级定点医院，仁济医院南院4月7日开张。4月18日，我带领重症团队入驻南院，同一日，ICU开始运行。不久，需要进入ICU的患者数量快速上升。从一个ICU单元20张床迅速扩展到2个ICU单元38张床，并准备开放第三个ICU单元。ICU床位的扩张意味着重症患者的增多，也意味着对国家第九版指南的执行力度增强。指南要求重型和危重型患者需收治ICU，提高救治成功率。但从另外一个角度看，ICU床位的增加，也意味着需要增加医护人员的数量。医院克服困难，迅速调集人员和相关设备，以保证ICU有序、高质量运行。    ICU正式运行至今，累计收治患者94人，包括危重型30例、重型49例、普通型15例。其中，80%以上是老年患者，40%是80岁以上的高龄患者。让我印象最深的是一个26岁的女孩，用新国博方舱总指挥、仁济医院党委书记郑军华的话来说，如果不是及时发现、及时转运和及时救治，也许上海要多出一位最年轻的死亡患者。4月15日，这个女孩因核酸阳性被转移到新国博方舱医院集中管控治疗。她身体很健康，无基础病史，但未接种疫苗。在方舱治疗期间，她情绪消极，每日仅饮水及少许流质。28日方舱医生巡视时，发现她呼吸状态不对，立刻进行检查和分析，判断她可能发生酮症酸中毒。女孩被送进ICU时，已经呼之不应，血压下降。检查后确认她发生了酮症酸中毒，伴随着严重的代谢性酸中毒、低血压、严重的低钾血症、高血糖。通过48小时的连续治疗，女孩趋于稳定，能够清醒对答，最终顺利出院了。    最近，需要进入ICU的患者数量越来越少，ICU的在院患者也越来越少，相信“大上海保卫战”的胜利很快就会来到。我和我的ICU团队也期待着ICU能尽早关舱。这是我连续第三年参加抗疫了，最让我高兴的是有一大批中青年ICU医师在抗击疫情中快速成长，我相信唯有坚持，方得始终。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T2.htm,6/1/22,第T2版:特刊,,False
,开“方舱”：一整夜安顿千余人,,    郇天文    上海市公安局经侦总队民警、增援方舱警队组长    “一次次逆行，我从未犹豫。这是警察的使命，也是青年人的担当。”    我叫郇天文，今年24岁，是上海市公安局经侦总队的一名青年党员民警。    4月1日深夜，我作为首批增援方舱警队组长，入驻新国际博览中心方舱医院。奋战10天后，我又接到命令增援国家会展中心方舱医院，执行以老带新的任务。队员熟悉岗位后，重回新国际博览中心。    一次次逆行，我从未犹豫。这是警察的使命，也是青年人的担当。    方舱工作比我想象中更辛劳和繁琐。大到参与重症病患的转院救治，小到帮助患者入舱登记，远到跨越数十公里帮老人配药，近到为有需要的人递上一杯热水……一切具体而又充满随机性，要求我们时刻保持紧张状态。    印象最深的，是“四叶草”方舱医院刚投入运行那天，大量患者转运入舱。我负责两个舱馆的开舱工作。从20时忙到次日凌晨，近6个小时一刻未停。我和同事们安排数十辆转运大巴有序停靠，完成了1000多名患者的入舱登记。    天气闷热，厚重的防护服压得人呼吸困难。2小时后，双腿像挂着沙袋一样提不起来。精疲力竭之下，我只能靠着意志力坚持。脱下防护服的那一刻，汗水浸透全身。    还有一次，一位老人向我求助，说带的药吃完了。那天深夜撤岗后，我带着老人消杀后的医保卡赶到指挥中心，通过多方联系，找到老人所在地的社区民警，拜托他们帮忙配药。第二天，期盼已久的药环环交接到我手上，递给老人时，他眉头舒展，我深深感到这场数十公里的接力是多么有意义。    50多天，我护送一批批患者康复出舱，目送一批批援沪医疗队凯旋，结识了一群又一群阳光可爱的战友。我看到小朋友们在方舱墙板上画哆啦A梦，写下感谢医护人员的话；看到同事扭伤了腰，却坚守岗位6个多小时，疼到直不起身子……感动总是不期而至。这些让我更加坚信，我们一定能够战胜困难挑战，守得云开疫散！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T3.htm,6/1/22,第T3版:特刊,,False
,曾经“哭了”期盼摘掉口罩再见,,    刘苗    虹口区香港丽园居民区党总支书记    “我们社区有几百名党员志愿者，解封之后，我想见见他们，他们也想见见我，我们好想把口罩脱掉，大家重新认识一下！”    4月中旬，因为一段电话录音，我成了大家口中“哭了的居委书记”，其实，那只是我和小区内众多“逆行”返岗居民交流的缩影。回想起来，那是疫情防控最吃紧的时候，我们7名社区干部面对社区内1383户居民，内心确实是十分焦虑的。当时我们整个小区防之又防，防控手势严之又严，但小区仍然出现了多例阳性。    当时我们组建的志愿者队伍中，有很大一部分是60岁以上的退休同志，但他们其实是更需要防护的群体。我看在眼里，疼在心里。就在这时，全市层面吹响党员报到的集结号，我至今还清楚记得，4月7日一早，先后有一百多名居民来居委报到，他们有些是国企员工，有些是企业负责人，还有些是机关骨干，但在那一刻，他们有一个同样的身份——党员。当大家站出来的时候，我和所有的居委干部有了一个共同的感觉：我们不是孤军奋战。    短短几天里，随着报到的党员越来越多，4月中下旬，我们组建起一支480人的青年志愿者队伍，替换下了全部60岁以上的长者。与此同时，在社区运行中，所有的核酸采样秩序维护、保供物资发放以及楼道消杀工作都由青年志愿者服务队承担至今。    虽然我们只能依靠“大白”服上的名字辨认彼此，但是大家的默契与日俱增。香港丽园小区有1383户居民，分布在13个门栋，刚开始光是全员核酸检测就要花上大半天，现在一个300人的门栋全员核酸用时仅需90分钟。此外，物资发放方面，从卸货到消杀到分发到户，1小时内我们就可以完成。    疫情是无情的，但是我们的居民，我们的党员志愿者队伍是充满热情的，可以说通过疫情，我们同居民真正地实现了心连心，结下了鱼水情。经历了这两个月，我们居民之间也更加熟悉彼此。因为志愿者始终“穿戴整齐”，很多人其实都没好好见过彼此。解封之后，大家都有一个共同的期盼：把口罩脱掉，大家重新认识一下！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T4.htm,6/1/22,第T4版:特刊,,False
,“路边站”积压快件终于送出了,,    张道嘉    菜鸟上海桃浦配送站站长    老百姓把快递恢复看作是一束光，我们一定要让自己发出那么一点微微的光。    我们这个菜鸟配送站位于桃浦地区，平时负责给附近的普陀、宝山两个区的多个小区配送天猫超市的快递。4月1日浦西开始封控，站点暂时关闭了，同事们都被“关”在家里，我每天起床后第一件事就是看手机，特别希望刷到解封的消息。    熬了大约一周后，我感觉再也不能这样在家里等下去了，快递包裹每天都在积压，与其消极等待，不如主动争取复工机会。接下来几天，我一边和公司商量对策，一边向社区争取，终于在4月10日拿到了出门的通行许可，我又花了半天时间找到一个旅店床位，租到一台面包车。当晚，我在工作群里协调，包括我自己，16名员工中有6个人可以返岗，这可把我高兴坏了，当时感觉浑身有劲！    因为站点所在的拉肯创艺园被封控了，4月11日，我们在马路边支起临时帐篷快递站，6个人穿着防护服，开启密集送货，饿了就吃泡面、面包，困了就睡车上。    第一天复工，我们就送了600多件积压的快件，当时送的包裹绝大多数是米、油、挂面、调料、纸尿裤等生活必需品，送到小区，给客户打电话通知时，电话那头总是一个劲地道谢，这让我们觉得一切都是值得的！    4月17日，园区解封了，我们也搬回了原来的位置。一个多月来，我们一天也没有休息过，而且返岗人数越来越多，现在，16名员工已全部复工。刚开始复工时，条件不是很好，有人晚上只能睡在车里，现在我们都统一住酒店。每天酒店、站点“两点一线”，这样便于管理，也减少感染风险，为自己好，也更为我们服务的客户好。吃饭是自己买菜，然后在站点轮流做饭，员工们在一起就像一个大家庭一样。    现在，我们站点每天要送3000多单快递包裹，这已经和疫情前差不多了。我觉得这样真好，我们平时那种熟悉的快递工作节奏又回来了！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T5.htm,6/1/22,第T5版:特刊,,False
,69岁热心阿姨烧饭送打工仔,,    单根慈    静安区南京西路街道重华居民区志愿者    这次当志愿者很不容易，考验体力，也考验耐心，但我会一直当下去，一直到干不动为止。    我今年69岁，从退休开始当志愿者，已经20年了。我们小区老人多。别看我也年近70岁，但比起90多岁的人，还算年轻的。3月15日开始，我就一直在小区当“大白”，已经2个多月了。    除了帮着发物资、抗原试剂，喊大家下楼做核酸检测，维持秩序，作为“老伙伴志愿者”，我还要把我楼里的两位老人照顾好。徐阿伯96岁，周阿伯也90岁出头了，都是独居老人，我帮他们收垃圾，送物资，送中饭，碰上核酸检测，就用轮椅把他们推下楼，做好再送回家。    4月6日下午，我在楼里收大家做完的抗原试剂盒，发现对门的小伙子开门像是要出去。我就提醒他：“小伙子，现在足不出户，不可以出家门的哦。”小伙子愣了下，苦恼地说：“阿姨，我很饿，想出去买东西吃。”我告诉他，现在商店都关了，出门也买不到东西。小伙子年纪很小，让人心疼。我就想把家里的米和菜，分给他一点。没想到小伙子摇摇头，说自己不会烧。打听下来，小伙子才18岁，是理发店打工的，从甘肃一人来上海。我烧了几个菜，一锅饭给他送去，小伙子很惊讶，也很懂礼貌，一再道谢。    这是很小的事，但大家知道后，都给我点赞，我也挺不好意思。后来不少邻居都去帮这个小伙子，帮他烧菜烧饭。我也几次去关心他，他说买了一箱方便面，坚持坚持就过去了，就不给大家添麻烦了。    小伙子知恩图报，也成了志愿者。大家被封在小区里，头发长了，小伙子就在门口免费理发，大家给他钱，他坚持分文不取。我偷偷拉着他叮嘱：你不收钱，大家给你吃的，一定要收。小伙子很腼腆，但心地很善良。    这次疫情，大家都很不容易。我的母亲也94岁了，和我弟弟住在另一个小区。恢复正常后，我想做的第一件事就是去看她。我常想，我做志愿者，尽可能帮身边老人，母亲的邻居肯定也会帮我照顾好她。远亲不如近邻，大家互相帮衬，一定能共渡难关。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T6.htm,6/1/22,第T6版:特刊,,False
,取名佑佑，寓意温暖护佑,,    “佑佑”父亲    浦东新区吉利名苑小区居民    孩子小名叫‘佑佑’，这个名字源于邻居们的护佑。    封控期间，我当爸爸了。孩子小名叫“佑佑”，这个名字源于邻居们的护佑。    孩子的预产期原本是4月6日，而我们小区是3月18日左右封闭的。眼看着疫情逐渐严峻，我们当时都很焦虑。    3月29日，妻子羊水破了。在居委的协调帮忙下，我们终于来到了医院。第三天，孩子出生。妻子剖腹产手术后，医院只能住几天；当时我们小区有确诊病例，处于封控中，回去也不安全。我在网上找了很久，终于找到一家愿意接收的月子中心，度过了相对安稳的14天。    在这些日子里，我们楼栋的联络人轩妈一直与我保持联系。“你们什么时候回来？需要我们做什么？”她总在微信上这样问。    4月17日，我们楼栋解除封控，一位有车的邻居主动来接我们回家。一进小区，我们就看到了邻居们准备的欢迎仪式：苹果寓意平安，蛋糕寓意高兴，小葱寓意聪明……家门口，有精心布置的贴纸装饰：“欢迎宝宝回家！”轩妈还为我们准备了活鱼、鸡鸭、蔬菜，帮我们团购了一些配方奶粉。    我们是去年12月份住进来的，在疫情发生前，和邻居们几乎都没有打过照面。在物资如此紧张的时刻，邻居们能主动伸出援手，让我们倍感温暖。    小区邻居商量着为孩子的诞生发一份喜报。当时我们还没有给宝宝取名字，在轩妈的提议下，大家就在线上征集小名。原本，群聊里大家讨论的都是团购、疫情，新生儿的诞生为大家带来了欢乐。邻居们都很上心，取了许多名字，都有美好的寓意。    在众多的小名里，我们选了“佑佑”。我觉得小朋友很幸运，特殊时期有这么多人帮助他、护佑他。    孩子一天天长大，需要去医院接种疫苗，轩妈的爱人开车帮忙接送的。5月1日，宝宝满月，摄影师邻居为我们拍摄了一张特别的满月照。温暖的故事仍在继续。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T7.htm,6/1/22,第T7版:特刊,,False
,别人抢菜，我们抢光刻胶,,    朱骏    华虹集团供应链保供团团长    各条业务线的领导与6000多名员工同吃住、共进退，鼓舞了士气，整个团队的凝聚力非常强。    没想到，专注于技术研发和生产计划的我有一天会被叫做“团长”。疫情期间，我被战时任命为华虹集团供应链保供团团长，负责4个基地、6条生产线的供应链稳定。从3月17日晚上开始，我和6000多名员工一起返岗驻厂，保障芯片不停产、不断供。    每一批芯片物料，从订购、装卸到配送，从陆运、空运到海运，物流链条上的每个环节都要亲力亲为。为了保障连续性生产，我带领团队急速“奔跑”：紧急发货，一批物料迅速从浙江、江苏等地发出；梳理短板，安排检测机构为送货的外地槽车司机做核酸；调配人力，梳理出能返岗的员工名单……担任保供团团长以来，我每日与团队一一排摸“堵点”，寻找解决方案。    光刻胶是集成电路生产中的关键性原材料，且全程需冷链运输，运输要求很高。我们联络东航物流等相关企业，协调运力，预定舱位，还要负责物料落地后的各项工作，保证全程冷链运输、与海关紧密沟通等。团队开玩笑说，别人抢菜，我们抢光刻胶。忙完空运忙海运，与船公司沟通、与港口协调，记不清给多少个相关单位打过电话开过会，过关斩将，终于一批批载着芯片生产物料的集装箱动起来了……    虽然疫情逐步好转，但供应链保供问题丝毫不能松口气。一些原物料滞留海外，还没有回到生产体系中；一部分物料的封装容器，国内用完后需要运到海外，加入物料循环中，目前这部分的出口任务也很重。现在，我和前期回厂的6000多名员工仍然驻守在厂区，各条业务线的领导与员工同吃住、共进退，整个团队的凝聚力非常强。4月，生产线一刻不停，单日作业量、产出量多次创下新高。    驻厂工作2个月，自己对家人亏欠太多。疫情初期，岳母感染了新冠病毒，所幸很快恢复了。当时，妻子既要居家办公，又要照顾孩子，还承担着巨大的心理压力。希望疫情结束后，能好好弥补家人。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T8.htm,6/1/22,第T8版:特刊,,False
,乐观武阿姨出舱再做志愿者,,    武银屏    在社区做志愿者期间感染新冠病毒，因为一段与家人的语音为人们熟知    “希望大家开开心心，希望上海早日康复。”    我是武银屏，老多人叫我“武阿姨”。因为一段录音，人家讲我乐观、开朗。实际上，在每一个上海人的楼栋里，都有这样一个正能量的角色。    4月22日，我出了方舱。居家隔离期满，我提出要继续当志愿者，居委也同意了。5月1日，我就返岗了。工作么，就是提前帮助核酸检测点消消毒，清点一下人数。    小区降为防范区后，不做核酸，我们每天做抗原。我负责每天收集抗原结果，然后统一发给居委。有两个老人，不会用智能手机。我就等他们抗原做好，上门拍照，一起上传。    我一直说，阿拉要“拎得清”。我就蛮注意的，不去麻烦别人。儿子给我送过几次菜，我叫他别送了。街道发菜的，而且我还可以订居委的大礼包，东西都有的。    虽然我一个人住，但是乐观总是需要的。疫情这么严重，谁也想不到。其他从方舱回来的人，有时候会找我诉苦：“有些人太敏感，看到阿拉，像看到病毒一样，躲得远远的。”    这个问题呢，我也一直劝大家，不要太放在心上。别人要这么想，你也改变不了。一方面，要是换过来，你会不会也有点害怕？另一方面，上海是讲科学的地方，懂的人还是绝大多数。    我举了个例子。楼道里有一个邻居是护士，要去医院上班10天，家中只留下一老一小。有一天晚上，她给我打电话，说小孩有点皮肤问题，拜托我到她家里，拍了孩子皮肤的照片，传给她。护士是专业人士，都不怕我们，这说明什么？不要被别人的看法搞乱了心态。    有人对从方舱归来的一些遭遇，表达不满。其实有的问题，我也碰到的，但我觉得要有点耐心。上海这次有60万感染者，政府怎么会不管我们呢？现在疫情还没结束，我们还是低调点，多呆在家里静养。等到一切回到正轨，我们放心外出，那不是更好吗？    这一次疫情，我当了第一批的志愿者。感染了，我也没抱怨。因为阿拉都是上海人，因为阿拉都爱上海。我现在的想法，就是希望大家开开心心，希望上海尽快康复。等康复了，我也想到夜报去看看。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T9.htm,6/1/22,第T9版:特刊,,False
,送广西爸爸回家，也紧张过,,    郑洲    上海裕皖实业有限公司总经理助理、“转运车神”    “既然我现在有能力帮人，就应该伸出手来帮一把。”    封控期间，我一直吃住在公司。记得那天收到要护送柳州爸爸回家的消息时已是下午5时。我们要护送一位癌症晚期的父亲到那里，实现他回老家陪儿子中考的愿望。时间紧迫，我收拾了一下晚上时点多就出发了，开了一辆7人商务车，和同事汪纯接力开车。没特别说好谁开几小时，反正我累了，他来；他困了，我顶上。    出发前怕高速路口服务站不开，我带了泡面、酸奶等。有人问我开车出去害不害怕？当然紧张了，我也害怕碰上特殊情况。但心里始终有一股特别想帮人的热血，更何况我是党员，也是退伍军人，既然我现在有能力帮人，就应该伸出手来帮一把。    比较幸运，第一次护送柳州爸爸很圆满，每个道口都顺利通过。回来路上又接到一个“救命药”求助，在上海看病的白血病孩子缺药了，我们特地绕到了浙江湖州，把“救命药”从湖州带回上海，给6个白血病孩子治病。这是人命关天的事啊！虽然开了几十个小时，没怎么睡觉，特别累，但一想到绕路后能接到“救命药”，就特别有动力去跑这一趟。    回上海休息了一天，5月17日又出发了。这次是来自安徽的癌症病人，儿子陪其在上海看病，他身体不太行了，临终愿望要叶落归根，回到霍邱县。我是寿县人，看到同乡求助更想出份力。本来名单上没我，公司定的是其他两位同事，我还是主动要求“再来一战”。就这样，当天17时多，我、王磊和高锋，带着安徽癌症爸爸和其儿子，踏上返乡之旅。病人身体特别虚弱，身上还插着导流管，所以我们把商务车上最舒适的第二排座位留给他。到达霍邱后，我太想回家了，想回去祭拜亡母，隔着一条淮河就是家乡寿县，不到一小时就能开回去了，但当时只能原路返回。    再回上海已是18日晚上，之后在公司隔离。做“护送专员”的事之前没跟老家人说，结果亲戚刷抖音看到我，把直播片段转发到家庭群，这下子都知道了，哈哈。我是个普通人，做了点自己力所能及的，帮到人了很有满足感。,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T10.htm,6/1/22,第T10版:特刊,,False
,的哥服务看病乘客从“不掉链子”,,    吴文根    海博出租车保障车队司机    把每名乘客安全顺利送达目的地，是我最大的心愿。    我是海博出租车公司“的哥”，驾驶出租车近20年。4月起，为满足市民就医、配药、离沪等出行需求，公司决定成立保障车队，身为党员的我毫不犹豫报了名。4月13日，新民晚报发起“战疫·帮侬忙”公益联盟，我火速加入，成为首批公益志愿者。在我看来，关键时刻挺身而出，为群众排忧解难，是党员义不容辞的责任。    封控初期，市民外出就医统一由街镇调配车辆，由于运力紧张，每天日程表被排得满满当当。疫情期间乘客大多是需接受血透、化疗的患者，一刻耽误不得，加上我驾驶的电动汽车中途还需充电，因此提前一晚就得做足功课，规划好时间和路线，确保“不掉链子”，按时抵达约定地点。    我住松江，每天3时半起床，先出门给车充电，再去附近医院做核酸，然后开始一天的接送，有时忙到晚上七八时才回家。工作中需严格遵守防疫要求，除了查验乘客核酸报告，还要“一差一消毒”，收工后再对车内外全面消杀。当然，很多时候计划赶不上变化。患者就诊时间有长有短，行程就得跟着调整；临时来了急单，还要见缝插针完成额外任务。有天中午，我刚送完客人准备吃饭，突然接到公益联盟转来的求助：普陀区一名白血病患者断药多日病情堪忧。我马上赶到他所在小区，送其到药店配药。    这段日子，一名孕妇也让我印象深刻。她怀孕三月却遭遇胎停，因为联系不到车辆，只能从嘉定南翔家中骑共享单车到徐汇区中山医院就诊，一天骑行近40公里。后来她向公益联盟求助，希望能找辆车载她去复查，我看到消息，心里很不是滋味，当场接了单。    从加入保障车队至今，我“连轴转”了一个多月，足迹遍布各医院、交通枢纽，累计为200多名市民提供服务，但我仍觉得时间不够用，总想再多接几单。每次送完乘客是我最幸福时刻，看着他们面带笑容、心满意足地离开，感觉再多辛苦都值了！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T11.htm,6/1/22,第T11版:特刊,,False
,向所有一线人员致敬,,    陈尔真    瑞金医院副院长，上海市集中隔离点医疗救治组组长、国展中心（上海）方舱医院医疗服务保障团队负责人    我深深被这些和我们不同的行业，但同样敬业的同志们所感动。他们是默默奉献的幕后英雄！    我想对所有参与各方舱后勤保障的各公司人员表示感谢。很多人只知道抗击新冠是医护人员的工作，但其实在方舱，所有后勤保障人员跟我们医务人员一样，穿着厚厚的防护服在舱内穿梭，还要做很多体力活，他们平时都是公司白领，但在疫情到来之时逆行而上，保卫家乡，他们的工作有时甚至比医护人员更辛苦。    我们瑞金医院管理团队在国展中心，也就是四叶草方舱工作时，和久事集团、上海地产公司以及东浩兰生团队共同奋战了50多天。他们每家公司都分区域负责物资供应、工程维保、环境清洁、餐饮保障、安全管理五位一体的综合保障工作体系，一个多月下来每家公司配送餐食、物资保障近千万份，清运医疗废物达到上千吨，切实保障了这所世界最大方舱的正常运转和安全，展示了国有企业迎难而上的责任担当，员工挺身而出的使命感和奉献精神。当送走一批又一批康复的新冠病人，他们和我们医护人员一样开心和自豪，因为这也是所有保障服务人员全力以赴，夜以继日、奋斗拼搏的成果。    我们作为方舱拓荒队，在每家方舱开始建设的时候就及时参加，记得每次当我提出某个细节可能会影响到病人安全，或者给病人造成不便，需要改进的时候，无论工程多浩大，他们都毫不犹豫、立刻开始着手动工，夜以继日完成目标。我深深被这些和我们不同的行业，但同样敬业的同志们所感动。    他们是默默奉献的幕后英雄！再次向所有奋战在一线的后勤保障服务人员致以崇高的敬意！,https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2022-06-01/T12.htm,6/1/22,第T12版:特刊,,False
