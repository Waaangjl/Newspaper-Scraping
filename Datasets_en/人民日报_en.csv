It requires various policies to coordinate and coordinate and accurately develop.  To implement the important requirements of ""the epidemic must prevent, the economy must be stabilized, and the development must be safe"", we must achieve adaptation of local conditions and precise policies.  Since the beginning of this year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, it has implemented the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council in all aspects. Recently, as the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control achieved staged results, parts of parts where the epidemic was seriously affected by the epidemic, and the production and resumption of production and re-production were promoting in an orderly manner. At present, the key node that determines the economic trend throughout the year must be seized and strives to promote the return of the economy to the normal track. All localities and departments should be guided by Xi Jinping's thoughts of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and in accordance with the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, it is difficult to forge ahead and promote the stable and healthy development of the economy and society.  Efficiently coordinating the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development. If you resume the labor one day earlier, you can recapture the losses a day to maximize the impact of epidemic situation on economic and social development. It should be seen that the resumption of labor and re -production is not as simple as personnel recall and machine restart. It also involves all aspects such as epidemic prevention and control, logistics support, safety production, and logistics. Enterprises need to do many aspects. Tension and reduction of orders. This shows that resume -and -re -production is a complex systematic project that requires coordination and accuracy of various policies. If there is a problem with any links, it may affect the entire process. Ensure that raw materials can be available, funds can be turned on, demandable and supportable, making resumers and re -production a sustainable process, making the economy move more better. It is a problem that must be resolved in the process of re -production and re -production. Therefore, promoting resumption of work and re -production, all regions and departments must not only ""support the horse"", but also help the enterprises to configure the equipment and personnel in place and operate as soon as possible. Reality problems help them return to the normal production level as soon as possible.  Supporting resumption of work and re -production, it is necessary to ""add"" fulcrum, kinetic energy, confidence, but also ""reduction"" points, taxes, and obstacles. Under the influence of the epidemic, the rent and fees of rent are stressful, the employment is still insufficient, and the corporate financing is difficult ... A series of problems can be blocked by the company's resumption of labor and re -production. Since the beginning of this year, my country's macro policies have gone forward, increasing their efforts steadily, from implementing new combined tax support policies, to issuing 23 measures to do their best to prevent and control the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development financial services, and then launch 33 to 33 A series of policies and measures to stabilize the economy, a series of policy portfolios points directly referring to various problems on the road of re -construction. For various places, we must not only increase implementation and truly benefit these good policies to the majority of market entities. It is also necessary to implement measures such as rents, fiscal discounts, and employment support according to the actual situation. The road is flatter.  Support resumption of work and production, not only the ""addition"" of the service, and the ""subtraction"" of approval. Under the influence of the epidemic, optimizing the business environment is especially important for enterprise development. Relevant departments should earnestly put the main body of the protection market in a critical position, and help the enterprises to find ways and solve problems. For example, under the premise of ensuring safety, we can create conditions as much as possible to simplify the resumption procedures, so that enterprises have less waiting time in terms of construction, employment, and logistics. , So that companies do not have to prove to work for a paper. The ""addition and subtraction method"" of such a business environment can allow enterprises to fully feel the warmth of the policy and enhance the confidence and confidence of faith and overcome difficulties.  Since the beginning of this year, due to the excellent expectations of the epidemic and international situation, the pressure of economic downturn has increased, and the complexity, severeness, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment have risen. Essence In this context, the importance of economic steady growth is more prominent and urgent. Effectively coordinating the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development cannot be ""cut"" and simplified. All localities and departments must realize that the important requirements of implementing ""the epidemic must be defended, the economy must be stabilized, and the development must be safe"", we must achieve adaptation of local conditions and precise policies. ; It is necessary to have the sense of responsibility of ""rest assured"", take responsibility for stabilizing the macroeconomic, accelerate the implementation of the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, actively introduce policies that are conducive to economic stability, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  Those who want to win together, and those who have the same storms. The more difficult moments, the more the departments of all regions and departments are needed to carry forward the spirit of the responsibility and struggle, and to help with the majority of the market, it is difficult to overcome the time.

Some experts point out that real data may be 5 to 10 times higher, because family testing is usually not included in official case statistics. The Washington Post commented that the United States may ""be in a silent case.""  Recently, COVID-19 virus infections and hospitalizations have surged in many places in the United States. According to the Wall Street Journal, the surge in confirmed cases is expanding to the northeast of the United States. From the central and western parts to Florida, it is facing the pressure of rising cases. US health officials and experts said that the number of cases in the southern summer is expected to increase, and the situation may be worse than the summer of 2021. Experts also warn that if the US Congress will not allocate billions of dollars as soon as possible, the United States will continue to occur in the United States that ""many unnecessary life losses.""  Michael Ostholm, director of the Research and Policy Center of the University of Minnesusida, said: ""You only need to look at the infected friends, colleagues and neighbors, you know how unusual people are now infected."" Previously, According to statistics from the National Broadcasting Corporation News Corporation and the ""World Real-time Statistical Data Website"", the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States has exceeded 1 million on May 12.  The New York Times wrote: ""Every deceased leaves countless mourners behind them. This losing chain reaction has swept many cities and towns."" Covid-19 died.

I have been looking for answers, trying to allow my family to get full information and make every effort to live.""

Independence expert Claudia Maol, an independent expert on the right of the United Nations, pointed out that the number of deaths in the nursing home during the US epidemic was still seriously omitted. The Washington Post website said: ""We are losing our elders, not only because they are fragile groups, but also because of a more deep -rooted epidemic: (think) The life of the elderly is not worth cherishing.""

Epidemic prevention and control measures have repeated impermanence, data statistical reports are distorted, two parties are leather each other, federal government and local governments are extensively criticized. ""The United States 'response to the epidemic is completely wrong."" American writer Peter Van Bulun said in the New York Post, ""Its failure part is attributed to the two parties' politics ... In developed countries, this has also exacerbated this situation. Equipment of income, high poverty, and obesity, diabetes, etc. have exacerbated our potential health problems. ""  John Broundstan, an epidemiologist at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States, said that the federal government lacked preparations, clear ideas, and political will in the early stage of the epidemic, and could not properly respond to the threat of the COVID-19 virus. Even now, there are still huge differences in the United States in resistance. ""Not only those safe and effective vaccines, but even wearing masks are still controversial.""  The Chairman of the Commonwealth Foundation David Bulu Menal pointed out: ""The failure of resistance is inseparable from the concept and political differences. It is said that some people are more likely to be affected by COVID-19, because they are ""almost no trust"" in medical service providers and refuse to accept epidemic prevention measures such as maintaining social distances, wearing masks and vaccination. This is a kind of disconnection. Some politicians in the United States ""pass the error message and destroy the suggestions of scientists, which will only exacerbate this disconnection.""  According to statistics from the Kaizawa Family Foundation, in the past 10 years, the expenditures used by the United States for state and local public health departments have decreased by 16%and 18%, respectively. In 2018, the per capita expenditure of the United States in terms of long -term nursing was 516 US dollars, less than half of other developed economies. Associate Professor of New York University, Selina Gg, said that due to insufficient manpower, some nursing homes in the United States failed to follow the relevant norms of epidemic prevention and control.  Director of the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases, the United States said that the United States should have responded to the country with the most popular preparations for the COVID-19, but it became one of the countries with the worst affected by the epidemic. ""This is an incredible tragedy, and many of them are avoided."" David Rosner, a professor at the School of Public Health of Columbia University in the United States, said: ""We have defeated the epidemic.""

The immunization vaccination was 774.779 million, of which the sequence was enhanced to strengthen the immune vaccination of 36.822 million people. The number of elderly people over 60 years of age covered 22.553 million people, and 21.76 million people were vaccinated throughout the process, accounting for 82.42%of the elderly population. Lei Zhenglong said that vaccination is an important means of prevention and control of the epidemic, which has obvious effects in preventing severe illnesses and death. The National Health and Health Commission encourages localities to further optimize the service model and provide more convenient and high -quality vaccination services.  ""Theoretically, infected with the Mutant of the Omikon Rongs, it will produce natural immunity, but it is not the choice we should make at present."" Wang Huaqing, chief expert of the China Centers for Immunization Planning, analyzed. As a result of severe disease and death, especially patients with chronic diseases and elderly people, the risk of this situation is greater. Secondly, since the application of COVID-19 vaccine, the effect of preventing severe illnesses and preventing death is very clear. In addition, Omikon variants were mutated, and the immunity generated infected was still great uncertainty. International studies have shown that the level of neutralized antibodies induced in the vaccine population in the vaccine population is lower than the vaccine vaccination in the vaccine population, and the protective effect of other mutant strain infection is limited.  How to do personal protection when receiving the courier? Zhang Liubo, chief expert of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested that you should buy related items from low -risk areas; when receiving express delivery, choose no contact method, make moderate protection, wear masks and gloves; the packaging of express delivery should not be brought into the room as much as possible. If you have to bring in, disinfection can be used for disinfection paper towels or disinfection agents; after handling the express, remember to wash your hands.  ""Disinfection is an effective measures and means to implement the ways of"" people, objects, and environment '""same defense and cutting off infectious disease dissemination, and play an important role in the prevention and control of the epidemic. Places and items are strictly disinfected. ""Lei Zhenglong said that during the organizational disinfection process of various places, it is necessary to strictly implement the disinfection technical specifications and processes. Support disinfection work and do a good job of standardized disinfection together.  ""Summer is coming. Students leave school and return to the countryside and cross -districts. They have great liquidity. They do a good job of preventing and controlling the summer epidemic in the summer. It is related to the health and safety of students, and it is related to the national epidemic prevention and control."" According to Liu Peijun, deputy director of the art department and the first -level inspector, the Ministry of Education currently takes the students to leave the school as a major work. The school returns to the countryside, supports the school's location, students return home, and various schools to do a practical work to do a good job of leaving the school and return home aspects to ensure that students ""leave the school in an orderly manner, travel safely, and get healthy.""",Epidemic prevention and control; prevent and control measures; vaccination; immune vaccination; mutant plants;

The growth rate of logistics demand has fallen significantly, the market size recovery momentum has slowed down, logistics traffic has decreased, the level of connection has decreased, the operating cost of logistics has increased, and corporate profitability continues to decline. It is necessary to continuously promote the implementation of the policy of guarantee and the smooth and uninterrupted policy, help the logistics supply chain unblocked, and create favorable conditions for people's livelihood guarantees and economic recovery.  Industrial logistics was greatly impacted. In April, the total logistics of industrial products decreased by 2.9%year -on -year, the first decline since March 2020. Although industrial logistics declined significantly in the month, the cumulative indicators still maintained a steady growth of 4.0%, showing that the overall toughness of industrial logistics is still strong, and the long -term development momentum is expected to continue.  The growth rate of the total logistics of units and residents continued to slow.

Among them, the online retail sales of physical commodities in the country increased by 5.2%year -on -year, and the business volume of national express service companies increased by 4.2%year -on -year, becoming an important support for the demand for consumer logistics of people's livelihood. From a regional point of view, since April, the Yangtze River Delta and the Northeast region's express delivery business volume decreased by about 30%since April.  The decline in imported materials has stabilized. From January to April, the total import logistics decreased by 7.6%year -on -year, a narrowing of 0.1 percentage points from the first quarter.  From the perspective of the logistics market, from January to April, the total revenue of the logistics industry reached 3.7 trillion yuan, an increase of 5.7%year -on -year. Since April, the production and life of some regions has been greatly affected. Logistics has become an important guarantee for the smooth supply chain and the re -production of enterprises. With the gradual improvement of logistics through local logistics, the supply of logistics market has maintained a slight growth. However, the logistics activities have slowed down compared with the early and during the same period, and the growth rate fell 2.5 percentage points compared to the first quarter, down to a lower level in recent years.  Experts from the China Logistics and Procurement Federation stated that in April, under the influence of the complex and severe epidemic in the country and the political conflict of foreign geographical political conflicts, the logistics operation has slowed down, but it must be noticed that many sectors have been promulgated in mid -April to vigorously promote the strong promotion The large arteries and microcirculation are smooth, ensuring that the supply chain of the industrial chain is ""not falling"", and the effect of logistics insurance is obvious. Judging from the later trend, with the acceleration of various policies for preservation, production, and living living in various places, the influence of upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain gradually weakened, and the demand for logistics is expected to improve, and the industry's prosperity tends to rebound.",Total social logistics; year -on -year increase; logistics demand; express delivery business volume; China Logistics and Purchasing Federation; logistics market;

After 33 days of continuous resistance, Beijing resolutely implemented the spirit of General Secretary Jinping's important instructions on the prevention and control of the epidemic, adhered to the general strategy of ""external defense input, internal prevention and rebound"", and the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general principles were not shaken, insisting on insisting on ""Fast, strict, accurate, and real"", in order to quickly and prevent death, is breaking through the state of ""stuck"". On May 25, at the press conference of the epidemic prevention and control held by Beijing, Zhong Dongbo, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Municipal Health and Health Commission, gave a judgment that the Beijing epidemic has entered the tackling stage.  This round of epidemic in Beijing was discovered on the afternoon of April 22 that a press conference was held at 11:30 that night to announce the epidemic. By 15:00 on May 25, there were 1642 cases of COVID-19 virus infections. Except for the peak of nearly 100 cases for 2 days, the rest always fluctuated up and down 50 cases, presenting a long platform period. This blocking war in Beijing is actually a prepared battle. So, why is there a fight for preparation so ""stuck""?  The city's anti -epidemic is already prepared  Containment and communication must fight for multiple seconds  ""The exchanges between big cities are very close, and the capital Beijing cannot fight without preparation!"" The reporter learned in the interview that starting from mid -April, Beijing has been in the state of preparations for anti -epidemic. At the end of March, the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee studied and approved the ""Implementation Plan for the Construction of the Public Health Emergency Management System in the Capital in 2022"", emphasizing that we must adhere to the bottom line of thinking, based on fighting, tough battles, comprehensively improving the emergency response ability of the epidemic, and the relevant emergency plan must be settled. The picture is settled, and the book is responsible.  The city held a meeting of epidemic prevention and video dispatching every day. Adhering to the city's overall planning and district self -fighting, from nucleic acid testing, centralized isolation facilities, mild compartment to medical treatment, etc., all have formulated special plans, and they have been fully prepared in advance. There is also a market confession. ""Beijing is a resource -input city. There are more than a dozen relevant provinces and cities involved in meat, and vegetables. The inside, the road, the ground, the ground, and all kinds of smooth and smooth protection solutions must be very specific and very detailed. ""The responsible comrades of the Municipal Commercial Commission told reporters.  However, once the epidemic appears, it is still fierce: the two spread chains quickly become three, and the epidemic has been hidden for a while. Beijing must fight in seconds, establish a 8 -hour work mechanism, and work uninterrupted in 24 hours. It is promoted to chase, control, flow, confidentiality, and transportation at the fastest speed. At 11:30 on April 22, a press conference was opened to announce the epidemic to the society.  ""Quiet, slow down, but not sealed."" Zhong Dongbo introduced that this is the leading group of Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work and the coordination mechanism for the joint control joint control and control of Beijing. Special circumstances, analyze the dissemination of the virus, and make a choice for the special status of the capital. ""It not only blocked the epidemic, but also left room for the operation of society."" Zhong Dongbo believes, ""From the global perspective, a large city with dense population and strong liquidity always controls a round of epidemic to about 50 cases per day without outbreaks. There is no outbreak. There is no precedent. From the current point of view, this combination of warfare is practical and effective. ""  The four -party responsibility ""Dead corner""  The epidemic rebounds ""no mercy""  Li Haiyang, who worked in a financial institution in Beijing CBD, said in an interview with a reporter: ""Everyone's psychological expectations seem to be about 21 days. This is a transmission cycle of everyone's cognition."" Then, why there is ""rushing and immortal"", ""dead ash repetitive re -ignition, re -ignition, re -ignition, re -ignition ""What about"" stuck ""?  Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the municipal government, who has hosted a press conference for many days in a row, told reporters that in 33 days, the hope of ""Zero-Covid"" has appeared many times, and there are even many days. It is close to zero, but the Quartet's responsibility is ""dead ends"", and the epidemic rebounds ""no mercy.""  Some of the unclear units in Beijing's units are unclear, and the implementation of epidemic prevention measures is not strict; individual personnel deliberately concealed the itinerary and violated the isolation policy to the dense places ... Since the development of Beijing's this round of the epidemic, some units and individuals have not implemented because of the ""four -party responsibility"". He was repeatedly reported to account for accountability, and even was investigated by the public security organs for suspected illegal illegal. ""This also shows that our epidemic prevention and control still has a vulnerability shortcoming. The implementation of the"" Quartet Responsibility ""is not in place. The prevention and control measures are inadequate in terms of 'fast, strict, accurate, and real."" Zhong Dongbo said.  In the conventional China Railway Eleven Bureau and Three Companies, in the clustering epidemic, the person in charge of the construction team Liu Moumou and others concealed the construction schedule, unbuttoned the population of health treasures, and across the region in social for a long time, which led to the epidemic situation. Spreading. As of the report on May 21, 20 of the 25 people such as Liu Moumou had been diagnosed, resulting in at least 21 points were closed and more than 900 people were isolated. On the evening of May 24, the Beijing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection conducted a notification of investigation and accountability, and many leading cadres were held accountable. Liu Moumou and others were filed for investigation for suspected cases of preventing infectious diseases. Liu Moumou regrets the serious consequences of his behavior.  Coincidentally. The press conference on the prevention and control of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on May 25, which notified the new social screening case within 24 hours. Among them, there are still cases that do not comply with relevant epidemic prevention regulations. During home isolation, they will go to supermarkets, work units and other dense places.  Find the problem daily and block the loopholes in time. Since this round of epidemic, Beijing has successively issued a number of measures to make clear requirements for home office, internal personnel management of the unit, and personal performance of personal performers to ensure that they do not leave dead ends.  So as fast and strict and tight  Turking must be one heart  At present, the Beijing epidemic has entered the stage of tackling the tail -tailed stage, which is an inspiring judgment. How to understand the tackling tail? Zhong Dongbo analyzed from four aspects: the scope of the epidemic, the spread of the chain, the infected person, and the medical treatment:  First, the scope of epidemic situation has been significantly reduced. The peak period of this round of epidemics has affected 123 streets in 15 districts and economic development zones. After May 9th, the diffusion trend slows down. At least there are 9 streets in 4 districts. However, recently, the epidemic fluctuated due to the influence of the agglomeration epidemic of Yuezhuang wholesale market and Dongfang Square.  The second is that most of the branches of early spread chain have been cut off. The city's difficult situation from multiple lines and multi -line operations has gradually shifted to the stage of controlling sporadic distribution and focusing on local key epidemics.  Third, the proportion of infected people within the scope of control continues to increase. Although the number of new cases daily in the city is still fluctuating on the platform period, the proportion of infected people discovered in the centralized isolation point has increased from about 40%to 80%recently. There are still scattered cases in society.  Fourth, medical treatment has achieved greater than in. Of the total 1,642 infected people, 912 were cured. After the number of cases in the city reached 727 cases on May 10, the number of cases gradually declined, and the cases of cases were stable in cases in the hospital, and medical treatment was stable and orderly.  The press conference on May 25 introduced that Beijing will take the initiative to prevent and control the epidemic prevention and control, and achieve social Zero-Covid as soon as possible with more resolute and decisive measures.  The next step in prevention and control measures mainly: First, it is to be fast and not to fall, and find a positive infection as soon as possible and block the spread chain. The second is to strictly manage to prevent risks from spilling. The third is to strictly strengthen the prevention and control of the social epidemic. The fourth is to continue to improve the ability to prevent and control the epidemic.  ""Home and office are also an important form of resistance. Today's home is for tomorrow's going out; today's temporary shutdown is to open up tomorrow."" Zhong Dongbo said, ""As long as we are in the heart, victory will come soon.""",Epidemic prevention and control; clustering epidemic; Beijing; communication chain; personnel dense places; infected person; press conference; quick way to do; medical treatment; investigation of cases; investigation; investigation; investigation; investigation; investigation; investigation;

The century -old changes and the century epidemic are intertwined. Economic globalization has encountered reverse flow. The world has entered a new turbulent change period. Uncertainty rises. How to maintain strategic fixed force? How to seize strategic opportunities? At the two conferences of the country this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping brocked the ""five strategic favorable conditions"" that my country's development still had in China, which provided important compliances for us to do a good job of various tasks, and further enhanced our confidence and confidence in the new era of our hard work, the new era of work, strength. From now on, this edition has launched a series of review articles to discuss the profound connotation and practical significance of ""five strategic favorable conditions"" with readers.  —— editor  The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to control the complex situation at a high level, calmly cope with major risk challenges, and show the great historical initiative, huge political courage, and strong responsibility  Multiple districts in Shanghai realize the society Zero-Covid, Jilin has continued to consolidate the results of resistance, and the epidemic in Henan, Jiangsu and other places has gradually stabilized ... Since March of this year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the country has been killed in the country. We fight together and fight side by side. We have adopted the most severe test of prevention and control since the Wuhan defense war, and achieved staged results. Practice has proved that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. Our prevention and control policy can stand the historical test. Our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.  The Communist Party of China is the core force of leading our career. During the National Two Sessions of the country this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping stood at the height of the overall overall situation of the great rejuvenation strategy of the Chinese nation and the unrealistic change in the world. From the five aspects, ""the development of my country's development is still many strategic favorable conditions"", of which the ranking is row. The first place is ""the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, which has always taken the overall situation and coordinated all parties to provide fundamental political guarantees for calmly responding to various major risk challenges."" This important conclusion fully demonstrates the skillful ability of the Party Central Committee to respond to the risk challenges on the road, and deeply clarify the fundamental political guarantee of doing a good job in the work of the party and the country. The confidence and courage to overcome difficulties and move forward.  Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, these years have been extremely unusual and extraordinary in the development of the party and the country. The complexity and severe nature of the party's environment, the heavor of the task and the rare history of the world. In the face of the economic situation of ""three -phase superposition"", the strategic judgment must be ""adaptable to the new normal, grasp the new normal, and lead the new normal"", and guides the Chinese economy to perform danger and stabilize. The people's war, overall war, and hindrance war to prevent and control protect the safety of the people's lives and health to the greatest extent; in the face of adverse situations such as the deep decline of the world economy and the encounter of economic globalization, and make strategic decisions to build a new development pattern. This is Grasp the strategic layout of future development initiative and the pioneering chess, and clarify the choice of the path of economic modernization in China ... The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping is high -level to control the complex situation at a high level, calmly cope with major risk challenges, and shows the great historical initiative. , Huge political courage and strong responsibility.  However, it is more difficult to be brave; In the practice of co -ordination of two domestic and international overall situations, coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development, we have a deeper understanding that when the storms are coming, the Communist Party of China is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people; The strongest leadership core of the Chinese nation's revival journey. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the most fundamental reason for the party and the state's cause has achieved historic achievements and historic changes. Socialist ideological science guidance. Maintaining the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping's Party Central Committee, the core position of the entire party, and the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership are the fundamental political guarantees to promote the continuous development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. It is necessary to deeply understand the decisive significance of ""two establishment"", strengthen the ""four consciousness"", strengthen the ""four self -confidence"", and achieve ""two maintenance"" to ensure that the whole party has a strong political cohesion and self -confidence in the whole country. At the new journey, we brought together the majestic power of all the hearts and overcome.  Today, we are closer to at any time in history, more confidence and ability to achieve the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At the same time, I also soberly realized that the changes in the world, the changes of the times, and the changes of history are unfolding in an unprecedented way. There are still various risk challenges that can be predicted and unpredictable on the road. The more you face difficulties, the more you must be firm in confidence; the more you face challenges, the more you have to stimulate the fighting spirit. In the new journey, we must grasp the ""five strategic favorable conditions"". The first thing is to play the biggest advantage of the party's leadership. Without the Communist Party of China, there is no New China, there is no happy life of the Chinese people, and there is no great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. As long as we adhere to the party's comprehensive leadership, we will resolutely maintain the party's core and the authority of the Party Central Committee, give full play to the political advantages of the party's leadership, and implement the party's leadership to all aspects of the party and the country's fields, and we will definitely condense up To overcome the powerful forces of various risks and challenges, the giant wheel of China will definitely be able to cut waves and stabilize.  ""The safety is not aspirations, and the danger is easy.""

Decisions and reality should be made according to the objective reality and the needs of the masses.  Correctly judging the Chinese economy must have strategic fixed force and dialectical vision. We can truly grasp the laws and enhance confidence from the world's perspective of China, the local situation, and the moment from the future. The economic data released in April recently showed that due to the more complicated and severe international environment and the significant impact of the domestic epidemic impact, the downward pressure on the economy was further increased. But this influence is short -term and external. For a large -scale and many economies in China, short -term fluctuations are temporary. ""Sob"".  Based on the current and long -term, China's economic operation characteristics can be summarized as ""the shape is fluctuating and the momentum is still good."" To see, the ""shape of the shape"" of some data is concentrated in the short term. The epidemic impacts the economic operation. In April, some indicators fell and the growth rate slowed down. It is also necessary to realize that the ""potential"" of economic development mainly depends on long -term. Since the beginning of the year, the economic growth rate of 4.8%in the first quarter is at the forefront of major economies, while price increases are at a low level. In April, CPI rose 2.1%year -on -year, and increased by 0.4%month -on -month. Optimization, the total imports and exports of goods increased by 7.9%year -on -year; the employment of major groups was basically stable, and the population survey rate of population in April in April was 5.3%. In the long run, my country's economy is stable and good, and the fundamental fundamentals have not changed for a long time. The basic characteristics of sufficient economic potential, high toughness, strong vitality, large spins space, and many policy tools have not changed. With the performance of high -efficiency and overall epidemic prevention and control and the effectiveness of economic and social development, the national economy is expected to stabilize and recover.  In the case of short -term fluctuations, we see that new economic new momentum is growing rapidly. Although the industrial production slows down under the impact of the epidemic, the high -tech manufacturing industry has maintained a rapid growth. The value -added of the value of the industrial upgrade has not changed in April. The consumption and investment affected by the epidemic also showed positive factors. Basic lifestyle sales continued to increase. From January to April, the national online retail sales of 386.62 billion yuan, an increase of 3.3%year -on -year, infrastructure investment increased by 6.5%year -on -year, and manufacturing investment increased by 12.2 %, The investment of high -tech manufacturing and high -tech service industries increased by 25.9%and 13.2%, respectively, respectively, respectively, and sanitary and educational investment in the social field increased by 24.9%and 12.5%, respectively. It can be said that the general trend of my country's economic transformation and upgrading and high -quality development has not changed. It has stabilized the macroeconomic market and achieved many favorable conditions for the target of development expectations. Essence  Continue to maintain a long -term ""potential"", and we must also actively respond to the ""shape"" of short -term fluctuation adjustment to solve the real problems of short -term fluctuations. On the one hand, it is necessary to effectively control the key risks and keep the bottom line of no systemic risk. The problems reflected in some indicators in April should be attached great importance to the planning of incremental policy, so that the steady growth policies will be further effective. On the other hand, we must adhere to the stability of the word, seek progress in stability, efficiently coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the development of economic and social development, and implement the requirements of ""the epidemic should be defended, the economy must be stable, and the development must be safe."" With the phased results of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the re -production and resumption of production have been promoted in an orderly manner, the stable economic policy and measures continue to be effective, and some advance indicators such as the power consumption have changed, and the economic operation will soon return to the normal track. Put the steady growth in a more prominent position. Decisions and reality should be made according to the objective and actual and mass needs.  The wind knows the grass, and the fire seeks the real gold. The more facing the impact of super expectations, the more we need to maintain strategic determination, firm confidence in victory, and focus on their own business. All regions and departments should unify their ideas and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, take responsibility for stable macroeconomic economy, accelerate the implementation of the determined policies, actively launch policies that are conducive to economic stability, boost market expectations, ensure that economic operation is in the operation of economic operations in Reasonable interval.","market expectations of comprehensive, dialectical, and long -term view of economic operation; short -term fluctuations; stable growth; epidemic prevention and control;"

In the face of the characteristics of many domestic epidemic points, wide, and frequent frequent, we must not shake the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy, scientifically control and accurate policies, and make efforts from all aspects of legislation, law enforcement, judicial, and law-abiding. Improve the ability to prevent and control and control in accordance with the law, and provide a strong guarantee for the prevention and control of the epidemic.  Prevent and control according to law, cannot be separated from a sound and complete legal system. At present, my country has constructed a public health laws and regulations including the prevention and control of infectious disease prevention and control, emergency regulations for emergencies, and vaccine management laws. The legitimate rights and interests provide solid legal support. At the same time, according to the new situation and new situation, my country actively promotes the revision of relevant laws such as the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and further enhances the practical pertinence of the law.  ""The world's affairs are not difficult to legislate, but it is difficult to do it."" The law -abiding by the people is an important part of preventing and controlling and controlling in accordance with the law. At present, some violations of laws and regulations, do not cooperate with or even destroy epidemic prevention, have occurred, hindering the overall situation of epidemic prevention and control. There are very few confirmed cases that deliberately concealed the trajectory and history of contact, causing the spread of the epidemic to spread; some business venues have not performed body temperature testing, code scan registration, and environmental killing, which causes clustered infections. Disrupting the public order ... In this regard, the people's defense lines that need to build a group defense are needed to guide the people of the masses to enrich legal knowledge, strengthen the awareness of the rule of law, and support and cooperate with the epidemic prevention and control work.  Only by knowing the law. Improving the relevant legal knowledge reserves of the people is an important issue for preventing and controlling and controlling in accordance with the law. All regions and departments need to combine the propaganda of the rule of law in the emergence and daily epidemic prevention work, strengthen the propaganda of the prevention and control of the epidemic prevention, guide the public to actively cooperate with the prevention and control measures of relevant departments, and fulfill their legal obligations in accordance with the law. On the one hand, actively innovate and do a good job of popularizing legal knowledge in epidemic prevention and control. On the other hand, warning education is an important part of the law. For example, while increasing the law enforcement of various types of obstacles to the prevention and control of epidemics, it will timely publish typical cases of illegal crimes against the law from all walks of life, and play a role in warning crimes and education guidance.  Understanding the law also requires usage. During the prevention and control of the epidemic, it is necessary to better play the guidance of the rule of law and let the masses know which and which can not be done. For everyone, in the face of the epidemic, actively study and abide by the laws and regulations such as the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and cooperate and support the epidemic prevention work, which not only helps to protect their own life, health and legitimate rights and interests, but also add strength to the prevention and control of the epidemic. It is necessary to actively study the knowledge of law -related laws, strengthen the awareness of the rule of law, understand the law, understand the law, and consciously abide by the law of the law.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is related to the safety and health of hundreds of millions of people, and it is also a national action that everyone is responsible and involved. The whole society jointly creates a good atmosphere of respecting the law and law and protecting the law, and scientifically and orderly prevent and control the epidemic in accordance with the law, in order to build the law to govern the dam and consolidate the majestic force to overcome the epidemic.",Infectious disease prevention and control law;

Cases increase the uncertainty of the epidemic prevention and control. The leading group of Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work and the capital of the capital strictly entered Beijing Management joint prevention joint control and coordination mechanism to hold a meeting to emphasize that we must firmly win confidence, carry forward the spirit of continuous operations, and Vietnam. To achieve the goal of dynamic Zero-Covid, find problems and replenish loopholes from new cases, and keep every line of defense, extinguish each hidden danger with faster, decisive and more resolute measures, and effectively block the epidemic spread chain. On May 21, Beijing introduced four more measures to further strengthen the prevention and control of social epidemics.  According to Xu Hejian, a spokesman for Beijing Municipal Government, the relevant measures mainly include:  The first is to fully implement the requirements of home office office in key areas. On the basis of Chaoyang District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, and Shunyi District, home office office is implemented, and other districts have further reduced their job rate and reduced personnel flow. If you really need to arrive, hold a negative proof of 48 hours of kernel acidic acid detection, and implement the ""point -to -point"" closed -loop management of the family unit.  The second is to adhere to non -necessary non -gathering. Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, Shunyi District, except for the guarantee of supermarkets, vegetable shops, catering institutions (only takeaway services), medical institutions, pharmacies and other normal business, all indoor culture and entertainment and all indoor culture and entertainment and entertainment and entertainment Sports and fitness places, offline training institutions, and shopping malls (except supermarkets, catering institutions, food stores) are suspended.  The third is to reduce personnel liquidity. Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, and Shunyi District continue to implement the current bus subway operation adjustment measures. Other districts in other districts and control areas in the management and control zone shake or stop transportation, subway stations closed stations, rental, rental, rental Restricted regional operations. The city's level of scenic spots are suspended, and various parks are open at 30%.  The fourth is to strengthen epidemic prevention management in communities (villages) and public places. Strictly implement measures such as personnel, vehicle entry and exit management and temperature scanning code, and checking negative certificates such as kernel acid detection at 48 hours. All types of units and courtyards are implemented in accordance with the above policies. Residents in the city have reduced out of epidemic prevention requirements such as non -tie, not gathering, and strengthening personal protection.  Related measures are tentatively implemented from May 22 to May 28, and will be dynamically adjusted according to the epidemic situation.  ""At present, the situation in Beijing's prevention and control situation is extremely grim and complicated, but there are still some units and individuals who have implemented the"" Quartet Responsibilities "", and even intentionally violated the prevention and control policy and broke through the bottom line of the law. At the press conference of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work, Pan Xuhong, deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, notified many immune-related cases. Among them, in the gathering epidemic of the three companies of China Railway 11th Bureau, Liu Moumou (male, 64 years old) and others in the construction of a project of the three companies of China Railway 11th Bureau to conceal the construction itinerary and lift the pop -up window of health treasures to make this allow Risk -controlling personnel who are isolated and controlled should be activated for a long time and a large -scale cross -region. Of the 25 people such as Liu Moumou confirmed, at least 21 points were closed and more than 900 people were isolated. Four people and other four people such as Liu Moumou had been criminally filed by the public security organs for the crime of harassing the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The relevant units and personnel epidemic prevention and control of the personnel found during the investigation of the case are not in place, and the disciplinary inspection and supervision department is conducting accountability investigations in accordance with the regulations. Pan Xuhong said, ""For such illegal criminal acts, the public security organs will work together with Wei Jian, market supervision and other departments to discover, investigate and deal with it, and severely crack down.""  Recently, Beijing has implemented home -office measures in the more serious area of the epidemic, which has played a positive role in effectively curbing the spread of the epidemic. Li Ang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health and Health Committee, said that during the office of the home office, citizen friends were asked to insist on non -necessary flowing, unnecessary unnecessary, no gathering, no door, not traveling, and no tie.

At present, there is a clustered epidemic in Beijing, and there are still scattered cases in the society, and the city's epidemic prevention and control situation is still severe and complicated. In order to achieve the goal of Zero-Covid as soon as possible, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint control joint control coordination mechanism to study and decide to further adopt faster and more solid measures to resolutely block the spread of epidemic.  At the press conference of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 20th, Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government, notified. There are three main measures:  First, risk the epidemic risk of fast control. We will resolutely implement the emergency response mechanism of personnel -related personnel to ensure that the fastest and fastest will complete the judgment, tracking, transfer, and isolation of positive cases and deepenings. Accelerate the tackling. For key points in key areas, analyze and judge one by one, and concentrate the power of resource forces to clear the risks as soon as possible.  Secondly, the transmission of the epidemic strictly obstructs the epidemic.  Strictly control risk personnel. For those who have higher risks such as the same life, work, and meals, they should insist on making every judgment, depending on, and separating, and the Japanese and Qing dynasties.  Strictly control risk areas. Strictly delineate and manage the controlled area, insist on ""not leaving the house"", and sampling at the door. After the case of the seal -controlled area was not found for 3 days, the residents could organize the sampling in order in order under the premise of doing personal protection. In principle, the personnel of the management and control areas areolate at home. Each household can arrange 1 person per day. Under the premise of regulating the N95 mask and making personal protection, short -term households receive daily necessities, throw garbage, and strictly prevent the leakage of control. Further press the main responsibility of various units in the real -scale control area and the responsibility for the supervision and inspection of the territory, strictly implement the closed management measures, strengthen the closed -loop management and health monitoring of internal personnel, stop the food, strengthen the security personnel such as security, cleaning, property and other service guarantee personnel manage.  Promote the society further. Learning control and control of Fengtai District, strictly implementing non -necessary districts, and implementing home office.

All sites are blocked, and taxi restricts regional operations. Fangshan District continues to strictly implement the unnecessary district, implement home office, and strengthen management and control zone management. Haidian District has further reduced the job rate and reduces personnel flow. After meeting the conditions for the termination of the control areas such as Chaoyang District, Shunyi District and other places, the measures and control measures are lifted in time, and public transportation is gradually liberalized, so that the unsolved prevention is unsolved. The city has continued to implement social prevention and control measures such as suspension of dangers and not returning to school for the time being.  Non -missed nucleic acid screening.

At the press conference of the Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 19th, Zhang Wei, deputy mayor of Shanghai, said that since mid-April, Shanghai has taken the principle of ""gradual progress and chain promotion"". Planning to promote the resumption of work and re -production of key enterprises. At present, the power supply, information communication, water supply and gas supply, refined oil supply, etc. The direct and stable operation of the production and life is directly related to production and life. In the first half of May, the city's industrial enterprises used the power consumption to recover to 80.5%of the level of the same period last year.  Recently, the single -day throughput of the Shanghai Port container reached 119,000 standard boxes, which resumed to 90 % of the normal level; Pudong Airport's cargo daily throughput exceeded 7,000 tons, restored to 70 % level; It reached 78,000 units a day, restored to 2/3 of the normal state.  Zhang Wei said that Shanghai will continue to adhere to the prevention and control of epidemic situations and economic and social development, which not only actively encourages the support of enterprises to restore operations, but also emphasizes that the rhythm of re -production and re -production must keep an eye on the overall situation of prevention. According to the overall situation of the epidemic prevention, Shanghai has formulated the overall arrangement of the restoration and re -production in stages. In the first stage of the end of May, the enterprise mainly adopted a closed -loop or semi -closed circular operation. From the second stage of starting in early June, according to the city's epidemic prevention and control situation, it will accelerate the advancement of resumption of work and re -production, and continue to expand the re -work of the enterprise.  Wu Jinsheng, director of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, said that this round of epidemic has a great impact on Shanghai enterprises, especially SMEs, and has great difficulties on enterprises' production and operation. We will increase assistance and further support the rescue of small and medium -sized enterprises.  Shanghai is promoting the recovery of urban public transportation systems step by step and steadily, and it is planned to gradually restore cross -regional public transportation from May 22. Among them, rail transit will first restore lines 3, 6, 10, and 16. The ground buses will give priority to 273 lines as the basic network covers all central urban areas, as well as the city's airports, railway stations, triathar hospitals and district central hospitals. The recovery of private cars and cruise taxis is being studied.  In order to strictly prevent the epidemic through the public transport system, Shanghai will gradually build a bus system with health travel and have fast emergency efforts. ""Places code"" and ""digital sentry"" are widely set up in stations, cars and other places. All passengers must hold 48 hours nucleic acid nucleic acid Provenal proof.  According to Zhao Dandan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission, according to the results of the ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening results, on May 18, Shanghai divided 3109 seal control areas, involving a population of about 710,000; There were about 2.36 million people; 56117 prevention areas involved about 20.22 million people.

It can carry out normalized nucleic acid testing in accordance with local epidemic prevention and control needs.  In various measures for the prevention and control of the epidemic, nucleic acid testing is a key effective means to quickly discover the source of infection and lock in control, and then take measures such as isolation. Especially in the process of responding to the epidemic of Omircor Rong's Omir Rong mutation in Jilin, Shanghai, and Beijing this year, the role of nucleic acid detection is even more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the prevention strategy centered on nucleic acid testing in order to better and more effectively cope with the epidemic.  At present, many cities and regions have successively explored the implementation of normalized nucleic acid testing, such as Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Dalian, Hefei, and many cities in Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province. Based on the local reality, these cities reasonably lay out nucleic acid sampling points, and the citizens organized the minimum 48 hours and the maximum 7 days for nucleic acid testing. In general, it was stable and achieved good results.  Normal nucleic acid testing is determined by the prevention and control needs of the local epidemic. It does not require all cities to establish a 15 -minute ""sampling circle"" for 15 minutes of walking, mainly focusing on the provincial capital cities and population cities with higher risks; All crowds are tested once every 48 hours. The specific test frequency is determined by the local area according to the development of the epidemic and the prevention and control needs of the local.  In order to ensure the accurate and reliable results of nucleic acid detection, the National Health and Health Commission mainly adopted the following measures:  The first is to strictly detect qualifications. Strengthen the management of genetic amplification inspection laboratory, conduct access to each laboratory to perform nucleic acid testing, strengthen the qualification assessment of technical personnel, continuously improve access registration, and ensure that institutions and personnel entering the entry to meet their qualification requirements. At present, there are about 13,000 laboratories with COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection qualifications, and 153,000 technicians who have obtained nucleic acid detection qualifications.  The second is to strictly detect quality control. While normalizing the quality control of the laboratory room, the State Health and Health Commission organizes the National Inspection Center to conduct room quality evaluation of the laboratory monthly. At present, more than 38,000 evaluations have been conducted on the laboratory. At the same time, in large -scale nucleic acid screening, the laboratory of each family who undertakes the test task dispatched quality supervisors to supervise and guide their testing work to ensure the quality of the test.  The third is to continuously optimize technical specifications. The two editions of the COVID-19 COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection technical operating procedures have been formulated to make specific regulations on the entire process of technical personnel, single mining, specimen mixed mining, specimen management, laboratory testing, and results reports. Innovate the detection technology of 5 -in -1, 10 -in -1, 20 -in -1 mixed mining technology, and has updated the implementation guidelines for nucleic acid screening organizations in the three editions.  The fourth is to focus on strengthening the supervision of third -party testing agencies. Formulate and implement the ""Interim Measures for the Management of the Medical Inspection Laboratory"" and ""Large-scale COVID-19 virus nucleic acid testing laboratory management measures (trial)"" and other documents, and regularly publish the list of institutions that have passed the acceptance. The laboratory of false test reports will increase supervision and deal with it in accordance with laws and regulations.  In the next step, the National Health and Health Commission will continue to increase the quality supervision of nucleic acid testing, comprehensively use various methods such as ""flight inspection"", regular random inspection, and publishing qualified laboratories. support.",nucleic acid testing; laboratory; normalization; epidemic prevention and control;

Liu Xiaofeng, deputy director of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, introduced that from April 22 to May 18, the epidemic situation in Beijing's districts showed a differentiated distribution: Pinggu District, Huairou District, no infected person reports; Mentougou District, Yanqing District, and Economic Development Zone did not fail Reporting social screening infection, the epidemic situation is stable; Dongcheng District, Shijingshan District, Daxing District, Miyun District, and Tongzhou District have not reported social screening infection for more than 10 days; The infected infected persons; the five districts of Xicheng District, Chaoyang District, Fengtai District, Haidian District and Fangshan District have reported in the past 7 days. ""There are still scattered cases in the current society, and the situation of the epidemic prevention and control is still severe.""  Recently, a newly added clustering epidemic in Beijing. As of 15:00 on the 19th, the Fangshan Branch of Beijing Institute of Technology in Yancun Town, Fangshan District has accumulated 11 cases and upgraded to a medium -risk area. After the epidemic, Fangshan District immediately launched a 8 -hour work mechanism to set up a joint disposal work with the Municipal Education Commission, the North Institute of Technology, the Municipal Health and Health Commission, the Municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cleaning, cafeteria food and other situations conducted comprehensive investigations, and the management and control of risk personnel were in place overnight. At present, except for the confirmed cases that have been transferred to a designated hospital, all other personnel are transferred to the centralized isolation point.  Since this round of epidemic, Beijing has conducted multiple regional nucleic acid screening, which has played an important role in blocking the spread of epidemic. On May 18th, the regional nucleic acid screening carried out in Beijing was sampled and tested a total of 21.47 million people, and the results were negative. In the special sampling window of pop -ups, 1 tube ten mixed and one positive. Experts from the Beijing Municipal Health Department introduced that the average incubation period of the Omikon virus is 3-4 days, so it determined that it was used as a round of continuous screening cycle for 3 days. However, there are certain differences in detoxification time of individual infections. In addition, the flow of personnel will increase the risk of spreading. With a single round of nucleic acid detection for 3 consecutive days, it cannot guarantee a hidden virus at one time. Therefore In order to block virus spread. Adhering to the combination of regional nucleic acid screening and normalized nucleic acid detection, Beijing is currently constantly optimizing the sampling time and point layout to ensure that the detection is full coverage.  In order to effectively do a good job of service guarantee for closure and control personnel, Beijing specialized in formulating the guidance of the work and control zone work, and sent to the front line of the community (village). In addition to reiterating the ""10+4"" management and control policies and resident protection measures, the guidance also puts forward clear requirements for residents' medical drugs and service guarantees. These include: community and community health service centers (stations) shall establish a docking mechanism with special medical institutions, arrange special personnel to collect the need to respond to the medical purchase of residents, through online diagnosis and treatment, medicine delivery, and contact with the medical treatment. Do a good job of medical treatment. The sealing and control zone shall set up a special service guarantee team and establish a temporary party branch to help personnel in the controlled control zone solve the demand for basic living security and medical service guarantee. In particular, it is necessary to focus on special groups such as old, weak, sick and disabled, and clarify that special personnel are responsible for doing well in demand collection, material purchasing, and home distribution.  At present, the city's community (village) in Beijing has fully upgraded various prevention and control measures. Each community (village) should strictly strictly check the stamps, strengthen the management of personnel and vehicles, and implement management measures such as temperature testing, checking the code, checking 48 -hour kernel acid test negative proof, registration and other management measures.",nucleic acid detection; full coverage; infected person; Beijing; epidemic prevention and control;

Social screening still finds sporadic emitting cases. In the past few days, the main responsible comrades in Beijing have continued to dispose of the epidemic disposal and went deep into the front -line on -site inspection. On the 17th, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint prevention joint control coordination mechanism to hold a meeting to pointed out that from the requirements of rapid and strict prevention and control deployment, unswervingly promoted the dynamic of society Zero-Covid Action, resolutely won this outbreak prevention and control war.  The wholesale market in Yuezhuang District, Fengtai District is the top priority of the current epidemic disposal. As of 15:00 on the 18th, there were 78 cases of infected infected epidemic in the clustering epidemic. Beijing has relegated management and control of Fengtai District. The district is not necessary to leave the district and implement home office. Fengtai District has strictly inspected and controlled control, and concentrated power to carry out information on personnel information such as visiting, delivery, and purchasing; deployed more than 2,000 people, teachers, and volunteers in the deployment of more than 2,000 people in the area where temporary control measures were taken Many working groups such as medical treatment and purchase of medicines have carried out on -site distribution during the division and time period. At present, all relevant personnel have all implemented accurate control. Relevant risk points involve the Shinsen Land Market. All merchants and staff carried out rolling screening of ""nucleic acid+antigen"". On the 17th, 15,000 samples were collected, and the results were negative. As a ""vegetable basket"" in Beijing, the new hairland market has increased the harvesting and storage and transportation of supply. At present, the weighted average price of vegetables has fallen to the lowest since spring.  High -quality, full coverage to carry out regional nucleic acid screening and normalized nucleic acid testing are the most important means to discover hidden infection sources as soon as possible. On the 17th, the regional nucleic acid screening carried out on the 17th, a total of 20.74 million people were sampled. The press conference on the prevention and control of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 18th revealed that the current analysis found that there have been no cases of nucleic acid screening in the near future, which not only delayed treatment but also caused the disease of the epidemic. sex. According to the relevant deployment, on May 19th, 20th, and 21st, Xicheng, Haidian, Fengtai, and Fangshan District 4, and street towns with positive cases in the past 7 days. Carnish normalized nucleic acid testing, and key industries and key groups continue to implement existing nucleic acid testing policies.  Recently, many Beijing seal control control areas have been unsealed. After the unblocking area of the controlled area, the personnel should be managed in accordance with the control area for 4 days; after the control area was unlocked, the personnel should carry out 4 days of health monitoring. On the 18th, the Beijing CDC issued three tips for the prevention and control of the epidemic after unblocking:  First, the community (village) should strictly strictly check the stamps, implement management measures such as coding registration, temperature testing code, checking 48 -hour kernel acid detection negative proof and other management measures to do a good job of follow -up management services.  The second is that residents should continue to do a good job of health monitoring, conduct nucleic acid testing as required, pay close attention to the health status of myself and members of the same residents, and measure the body temperature as required. 11 types of COVID-19 related symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and diarrhea should be reported to the community immediately and in accordance with the corresponding control measures, and do not purchase and take medicine by themselves.  Third, during the health monitoring, strictly implement the requirements of non -gathering, no meals, avoid unnecessary going out, do not go to dense places, and take public transportation less. It is recommended to work at home. Point -to -point closed loop management, maintain a safe social distance, standardize wearing masks, and do personal protection.  According to reports, from May 19, Beijing will adjust the inspection requirements of the nuclear acid certificate of commuters in Beijing and Tianjin. Each time commuters will hold 48 hours of kernel acid test negative certificates. This measure will be adjusted in time after the epidemic is stable.",nucleic acid test; Beijing; control measures; clustering epidemic; epidemic prevention and control;
447,The economic and social order of many countries is impacted,李志伟;刘玲玲;花放;,17,5/19/22,64,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruUWvjXeWeGaVTb9OHHXFLEzLgMwr1uH3CHNsDIWwjsHgp2wpEbO6KKmNzcGqOFG1ys1wUi_gxqC_0Q8QvO1O9AayZp-qRygneMMYndwTazWQOekBamWp0Vk&uniplatform=NZKPT,"Core reading  The World Health Organization recently emphasized that the COVID-19 outbreak is still ""international concern for emergencies in international attention"", and has repeatedly urged governments to maintain sufficient vigilance and preparations in the prevention of epidemic prevention. It turns out that ""lying"" in some Western countries cannot eliminate epidemic prevention, and it will also cause people to healthy people around the world to be in a huge security risk, which will have a serious negative impact on the global anti -epidemic process and the restoration of economic and social order.  Recently, some countries in the United States and Europe have adopted a ""coexistence with the virus"" policy to retain only some basic epidemic prevention measures. From the perspective of related data, the vast majority of countries that adopt ""lying down"" epidemic prevention have paid a heavy price. The number of confirmed cases has increased again, and the rising cases of death are rising. The medical system is under tremendous pressure. Economic and social life is also facing many risks and challenges.  Multi -country epidemic has shown a rebound trend again  The United States has gradually relaxed the epidemic prevention measures since February this year, and the states have canceled the ""mask order"" one after another. Many states have begun to close the COVID-19 virus detection point, and the airline no longer require passengers to wear masks. Supplementary funds required for epidemic. However, this ""lying"" measure has not worked, and the epidemic has recently shown a rebound in the United States.  The latest statistics from the Global COVID-19 epidemic released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of the morning of May 18, Eastern time, there were more than 1 million COVID-19 death cases in the United States. According to statistics from the New York Times, as of the week of May 16, 95,000 newly confirmed cases were added in the United States, an increase of 57%in the past two weeks. Inpatients have risen by 26%in the past two weeks. Most counties in New York have become high-risk areas for COVID-19 virus transmission. Because the government has reduced the inspection and related subsidies of the COVID-19 virus, many people can only detect themselves at home. Experts believe that this has seriously underestimated the real diagnosis data of the United States.  The Fox News Network reported that with the rise in confirmed cases, the United States ""may usher in a surge in cases."" The New York Times reported that due to the high spread of communities and the rising number of patients in hospitals in the fifth wave of epidemic, New York City Health officials had to strongly recommend that citizens wearing medical masks in public indoor places such as office and stores, but There is still no mandatory request to do so. Earlier, New York City, as many cities in the United States, relaxed the ""mask order"".  France and Germany have recently canceled most of the prevention restrictions on epidemic prevention, and no longer forced the public to wear masks in most indoor places. From May 16th, France no longer requires the public to wear masks while taking public transport.  As of May 16, there were more than 147,000 death cases in France, and a total of more than 29.18 million cases had been confirmed, which was equivalent to one of each of the three French people infected with COVID-19 viruses. In the past 7 days, the average number of new confirmed cases in France in the past 7 days was about 23,000 cases, and it still operated high. According to the French BFMTV report, after the relaxation of epidemic prevention measures, the increase in the number of infected people, the number of hospitalizations, and death cases showed that the situation of the epidemic situation was still severe. The number of residents in France increased by 8%within 7 days of lifting, which brought tremendous pressure on the medical system.  After relaxation of epidemic prevention measures, German daily death cases quickly doubled. In early April, it broke through 600 cases per day, and still ranks the top five worldwide. Due to the spread of the epidemic, the 60 % hospital in Germany had to postpone the scheduled conventional surgery. As of the beginning of this month, the data of the German epidemic was still high, and the number of newly -added cases daily was still more than 100,000.  It brings harm to the health and economic development of the people  The British ""New Scientist"" magazine recently published a comment article stating that some countries are now giving up the goals of COVID-19 virus transmission as much as possible, but there is evidence that ""the 'ZERO-COVID' policy is the best choice."" The author of the article and British writer Michael Marshall said that from reducing the disease's disease to promoting economic growth, a country that implements the ""Zero-Covid"" policy ""does better on each indicator."" ""If more countries implement the 'ZERO-COVID' policy, human beings will be in a better situation.""  Marshall said that the most obvious benefit of the ""Zero-Covid"" policy is that the number of diseases is greatly reduced. At the same time, the economic damage is also small. ""When the virus almost does not exist, people have the confidence to get out of the house, so that the economy can be fully opened."" He said that a study in 2021 found that compared Fast. In fact, ""lying"" epidemic prevention will only bring great harm to the economic and social, people's health, and global anti -epidemic cause of various countries. threaten"".  Michael Osthom, director of the Research and Policy Center of the University of Minnescea, said that the mutation of the COVID-19 virus is much faster and wider than expected. Maria Vankelkhofv, the leader of the WHO Emergency Project, said that the more cases of infection, the more the opportunities of the COVID-19 virus mutation.  The Washington Post reported that a new research report showed that the average life expectancy of the United States fell to 76.6 years. In the two years since the epidemic, the data decreased by 1.87 years and 0.39 years. At the same time, the epidemic has also caused a large number of ""epidemic orphan"" that lost their parents or mainly regarding the protection of people. The National Broadcasting Corporation reported that there are currently about 250,000 ""epidemic orphans"" in the United States, and ""a generation of children may face serious psychological disorders in the next few years.""  Data released by the US Department of Commerce recently showed that the US economy shrank 1.4%in the first quarter of 2022; data released by the French National Bureau of Statistics showed that the economic growth of France in the first three months of France was zero; It shows that the German economy in the first quarter of this year was only 0.2%month -on -month.  Experts call for strengthening the epidemic prevention and control  Multi -country experts have called for the epidemic to prevent epidemic prevention.  ""It is a mistake to relax all protection measures too quickly,"" said Eric Tonner, a researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, the University of Public Health, the University of Johns. "" significance"".  Anthony Fitch, director of the Institute of National Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said that the epidemic ""has not ended anyway"". The United States is still experiencing great popularity. It is out of reach, ""it is difficult to really get strong group immunity."" Fickna predicts that the United States may usher in a new wave of epidemic in this fall. The ""Washington Post"" polls show that only 34%of the people believe that the epidemic has been completely controlled. Most people think that it will take at least one year to fully return to normal life, and 20%of the people believe that they will never return to the past.  Virusologist Bruno Lina, a French Science Commission, said that France still faces the threat of rebounding by a new virus variant. ""We can't say that the epidemic is over, and the public health situation in France is still very fragile. The incidence of many places has been rising, and the medical sector is still facing huge challenges."" Lina said that the government and the public cannot relax the potential new varieties of the potential new varieties. Be wary, the corresponding epidemic prevention policies should be formulated and implemented in a timely manner.  Anto Velaht, director of the Institute of Global Health of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, pointed out that he should not easily abandon epidemic prevention restrictions and measures, and giving up means risks, especially for fragile people. He said that COVID-19 cannot be as such with influenza painting. Fluid cannot cause 100 to 300 people per day in France, and will not cause such a large number of patients to be treated in the intensive care unit for several consecutive months. In addition, the medical community currently lacks understanding of the sequelae of COVID-19, and it is unknown whether a more dangerous virus variant will occur in the future.  Claus Leinhart, chairman of the German Federal Physician Association, bluntly released the wrong signal to the society to relax prevention and control measures. Scholar Brockman, a scholar at the University of Berlin, said, ""In the past two years, countless studies have proven that epidemic prevention measures such as wearing masks can effectively curb the spread of epidemic."" German Health Minister Laitbach said that ""COVID-19 is not a flu."" At present, there have been signs that Omikon poison strains are still evolving, and the next wave of epidemic will be unexpected.  ""Think about it, if in early 2020, every country can adopt the 'Zero-Covid' policy, what will happen. It is not controversial that the number of deaths in the world will be much lower and economic losses will be reduced ... The most important thing is that the COVID-19 virus may not have the opportunity to evolve.

They were endless day and night, in order to quickly promote the virus to protect the life and health of patients. The reporter interviewed the medical transfer team of Shanghai Province and Tianjin.  On April 25, 50 negative pressure ambulances, 1 command vehicle and 190 medical personnel from 10 cities in Henan departed from Zhengzhou to Shanghai. ""The team has not stopped for a moment, and the party secretary and captain Ma Gaofeng, the party's general branch and captain of Henan Province, said that the transshipment team built the dispatch command platform on the highway.

Each trip has tens of kilometers or even nearly 100 kilometers."" Ma Gaofeng said.  Li Mingjie, an emergency doctor of the Shanghai Medical Emergency Rescue of Tianjin Hospital, said that many patients live in old communities and need to climb the stairs to lift the stamps.

""Among the transshipment patients, the youngest is only one month, the largest 103 years old. Except for maternal, tumor patients, dialysis patients, there are many elderly people, most of them are 80 or 90 years old, and most of them have basic diseases. The whole process must be more careful.  During the transfer, the critical situation must be dealt with at any time. Li Mingjie transported a 95 -year -old man. The old man suddenly dropped blood oxygen on the ambulance and his complexion was pale. Li Mingjie decisively gave the patient a high flow of oxygen, and helped him suck phlegm.

With the gradual release of various policies and the gradual release of the policy effect, the normal economic order will be quickly restored, and the economic operation will soon return to the normal track.  A few days ago, the Chinese economy was released in April. Affected by the excellent expectations of the new round of epidemic and changes in the international situation, the new downward pressure on the economy has increased. How to view the current economic situation?  At the online press conference of the National Development and Reform Commission in May, the spokesman Meng Wei said: ""At present, the domestic epidemic rebound has been effectively disposed of, and the policy effects are gradually released by various policies. Fast recovery, economic operation will return to normal track quickly. ""  Steady growth-  Efficiently coordinate the epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market  In the face of the complexity, severe and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment, how can we make a stable growth? What are the actual tricks of employment? What are the favorable conditions for stable prices?  Persist in steady words, seeking progress steadily, and putting steady growth in a more prominent position. Effectively coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, and various measures are densely introduced.  Investment stabilizes, macro policies are advancing. From January to April, the National Development and Reform Commission approved and approved 38 fixed asset investment projects, with a total investment of 533.3 billion yuan. Among them, 8 fixed asset investment projects were approved in April, with a total investment of 18.8 billion yuan, which was mainly concentrated in informationization and energy. At present, the amount of local government bonds used in project construction in 2022 has all been issued. As of the end of April, about 1.4 trillion yuan of special bonds issued this year.  Smooth circulation to ensure that material transportation is connected. In response to problems such as cross -regional logistics and poor transportation and poor transportation in some areas, departments in various regions have combined punch: eliminate card points, strengthen the monitoring of the traffic of highways and ordinary national highways, and key material transportation. Public permit system. As of May 16, the traffic decline in the Yangtze River Delta has continued to narrow, and all toll stations and service areas in key areas involved were opened. Opening the blockage point, four production materials transit stations have been built in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, which played an important role in promoting key industries such as automobiles.  Cost reduction, effectively stimulate market vitality. Continuing the implementation of institutional tax reduction and fee reduction of institutional tax reductions such as manufacturing, small and micro enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households, improve the optimization of phased cost reduction policy arrangements, and levy small -scale taxpayers in the phased VAT; Removal tax refund, increase tax incentives for innovation of small and medium -sized enterprises in science and technology, and guide funds to flow more to key areas and weak links ...

""A spokesman said.  Stable employment-  The employment situation continues to be under pressure, and the four aspects are implemented to stabilize employment work in four aspects  Employment is the foundation of people's livelihood. Since March, affected by many domestic epidemic points, wide face, frequent excess, and more complicated and severe international situation, the difficulty of market entities has increased significantly, and some key groups have increased difficulty in job hunting. In April, the national urban investigation rate was 6.1%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, and the employment situation continued to undergo pressure.  In response to the severe situation and challenges of employment fields, recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly deployed research and employment issues. Many departments have issued relevant measures to do everything possible to stabilize existing employment and actively increase new employment. How to further increase the implementation of employment priority policies? The spokesman said that the implementation of various measures and employment measures, focusing on promoting four aspects.  Protecting market entities guarantee employment. Under the condition of preventing and controlling the epidemic, promote the re -production of enterprises. Accelerate the implementation of tax refund tax reductions and social insurance premiums, such as helping enterprises, and other policies for helping enterprises, promote the cost reduction work, and strengthen the precise support for manufacturing, contact services, small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households. The burden of the market entity helps them survive the difficulties and keep their posts.  Promote innovation and entrepreneurship. Clean up and cancel the unreasonable restrictions on employment and entrepreneurship, further enhance the leading role and service capabilities of the dual -innovation demonstration base, carry out in -depth entrepreneurship to drive employment demonstration operations, and enhance the service capabilities of dual -innovation platforms. Strengthen the construction of platforms such as returning home and entrepreneurship parks, and encourage returning home to start a business. Support multi -channel flexible employment, strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of workers in the new employment form, and continuously release innovative and entrepreneurial momentum.  Grasp the key groups to employment steadily. Implement the ""Notice on Further Doing a Better Employment and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship of College Graduates"", and encourage localities to introduce more support policies. In -depth promotion of the construction of a demonstration park for the integration of rural industries, vigorously develop the rural rich people's industries, and actively promote the use of work in the field of rural infrastructure construction to expand the local employment channels of farmers.  Talent training strengthens employment support. Deepen the integration of vocational education and education, school -enterprise cooperation, and continue to support the construction of vocational education quality and quality and education integration. Increase support for the construction of public training bases, promote the combination of production training at high quality, promote the co -construction and sharing of vocational skills training resources, and help carry out large -scale vocational skills training and training.  Steady prices--  There are sufficient supply of industrial and agricultural products and services, and make every effort to do a good job in the price of commodities.  Since the beginning of this year, international commodities have shocked at a high price, and major economies in the world have faced greater inflation pressure. In sharp comparison with other major economies, in April, my country ’s CPI rose 2.1%year -on -year. In the case of large input inflation pressure, it was not easy for my country's prices to maintain a stable and gentle rise.  ""Faced with the complex and severe external situation, my country coordinates the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development, accurately grasps the rhythm of macro policies, and continues to do important commodities to guarantee stable prices."" Spokesman said that various regions and departments have taken multiple measures to do with multiple measures to do with each other. Good insurance supply is stable. Since this year, my country's prices have been running in the overall reasonable range. In April, the core CPI of food and energy prices fell steadily, up 0.9%year -on -year, and the increase fell 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.  In general, the market supply capacity of my country's goods and services is relatively sufficient, and there are more favorable conditions to maintain stable prices.  Food prices are stable. Recently, international grain prices have risen, but the country has maintained overall stability. my country's grain production has stabilized more than 1.3 trillion kg of consecutive years, and the inventory is sufficient. Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said that the varieties of rice and wheat rations in my country and wheat have been greater than demand for many years, and a small amount of imports are mainly breeds. Corn and soybeans have a certain import volume, which will be affected by a certain degree of international markets, but the impact is limited. Since the beginning of this year, my country's food production situation has continued to turn well, and food prices have remained stable and have a good foundation.  Energy supply is guaranteed. The proportion of oil and natural gas in my country is relatively high, and the rise in international energy products will increase, which will increase import costs to a certain extent, bring input effects on some industries, and increase cost -promoting price increase pressure. However, we must see that my country's energy main body is coal, while my country's coal reserves are relatively abundant, and the production capacity is strong. With the gradual release of advanced coal production capacity, it is conducive to curbing the rise in energy prices. In April, my country's coal production increased by 10.7%year -on -year, and the price of coal mining and washing industry increased by 0.5 percentage points year -on -year. The spokesman said that the National Development and Reform Commission will use coal as a ""anchor"" to do a good job of energy guarantee stable prices, stabilize the electricity price by stabilizing the price of coal, and then stabilize the overall cost.  Most industrial consumer goods have sufficient supply. my country's industrial system is complete and has strong supporting capabilities. The production of major industrial products is at the forefront of the world, laying a solid foundation for product prices. The spokesman said that it will increase the supervision of the spot market with the relevant departments, and severely crack down on illegal acts such as fabricating the spread of prices, hoarding, and raising prices, especially malicious speculation in capital, and will resolutely crack down.  ""We will adhere to comprehensive policies, accurate regulation, and do our best to do a good job of stable prices for commodities."" The spokesman said that in the later period, my country has strong economic toughness, large market space, rich policy boxes, abundant industrial and agricultural products and services. It is completely conditional, capable, confident, and continue to keep the prices run smoothly.",Epidemic prevention and control; commodity; stable growth; normal track; investigation of unemployment rate; reduction of costs; small and micro enterprises; integration of production and education; integration of production and education;

Realizing the social ZERO-COVID means that the community transmission that has blocked the epidemic is an important prerequisite for gradually unblocking and restoring normalization prevention and control.  According to the evaluation criteria of ZERO-COVID, the number of positive infected people in the area of the administrative division (including management control areas, prevention zones, and social mobile personnel with non-closed-loop management, etc.) For three consecutive days of a single day, it can be considered as zero-covid.  Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, Shanghai has experienced a lot of difficulty: On April 4, the number of new positive infections in the city exceeded 10,000 for the first time; on April 13, the number of new positive infections in a single day reached 27605 cases; 4 On the 29th, no new cases were found during the first investigation of the risk crowd; on May 15, the number of newly positive infections in a single day fell to 1,000 cases for the first time.  In recent stages, Shanghai continued to carry out the ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening based on the three zones. According to the screening results, on May 16, a total of 4057 seal control areas were divided, involving a population of about 860,000; 16,484 management and control areas, involving a population of about 3 million; 51,803 prevention zones, involving a population of about 19.44 million.

The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to deeply, complete, and comprehensively understand the policies and policies of the epidemic prevention and control of the Party Central Committee, and resolutely overcome problems such as insufficient awareness, insufficient preparations, and lack of work. , Resolutely overcome the contempt, ignorance, self-righteous, and other thoughts, always maintain a sober mind, unwavering to adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and resolutely distinguish all the words and deeds of the policy and deeds of the policies of our outbreak prevention.  At present, why can't my country relax the prevention and control of the epidemic? Once it is loose, what impact may it affect the health of the people? The reporter interviewed the experts of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism.  COVID-19 virus impact cannot be indifferent  Experts believe that the global epidemic is still high, the virus is still mutating, and the ultimate direction of the epidemic is still great uncertainty.  First of all, soberly understand the uncertainty of virus mutation. Ma Xiaochun, director of the Severe Medicine Division of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, said that the mutant strains of Omiko are more contagious and faster, and the number of infections is more. The impact of the new virus variation in the next is not clear.  ""Don't despise the mutant strain of Omikon. We found in the treatment of severe illnesses that compared with the previous virus, Omikon mutant strains last longer in some elderly patients with severe patients, and they will still show heavier lungs. The shadow of invasion has developed into oxygen disorder and respiratory failure. ""Ma Xiaochun said.  Second, we must soberly understand aging and insufficient medical resources. Tong Zhaohui, deputy dean of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and director of the Beijing Institute of Respiratory Diseases, believes that the current epidemic prevention and control cannot be loose. my country is a developing country with a large population. It is densely populated. There are many elderly people with the elderly with the elderly, especially the elderly. The other side is the total amount of medical resources, especially the insufficient medical resources, and uneven distribution. Once the epidemic prevention and control are relaxed, large-scale people are infected, causing medical resources to be crowded, causing a large number of severe illnesses and diseases, which not only affects COVID-19 treatment, but also affects other diseases.  ""From the perspective of our severe treatment, especially in some big cities, there are many elderly people over 80 years old, and most of them have high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease and other diseases. Covid-19 virus and influenza are different. Multiple systems and organs in the human body make the original diseases aggravate and lead to organ failure. This will be more difficult to treat. Even after treatment, the prognosis will be worse. ""Tong Zhaohui said.  Third, the protection of a sober understanding of key groups needs to be strengthened. Du Bin, deputy dean of the Beijing Union Hospital, said that at present, the rate of vaccination rates such as the elderly and other key groups is not high. All parties in the society should strengthen the science of vaccine to improve the protection of key groups.  Severe treatment achieved significant results  For more than two years, experts from the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism have participated in the treatment of patients in many places across the country and adopted a series of measures to summarize a set of effective experience and practices.  ""'Four episodes' is a very important experience that we do well in treatment."" Tong Zhaohui introduced that through centralized patients, concentrated experts, centralized resources, and centralized treatment, we can concentrate on patients with severe illnesses to high -level and strong designated hospitals. receive treatment. In order to improve the efficiency of treatment, a classification is also carried out within the designated hospital. For example, in addition to the general ward and intensive ward, a sub -intensive ward or a senior monitoring ward is also set up to categorize and apply patients with severity of different diseases.  ""We also promote the referral system between the city -level designated hospitals, district -level designated hospitals, and square cabin hospitals. The hospital expert group screened the potential high -risk groups every day, and transferred to patients who may develop into severe illnesses early. The hospital. ""Tong Zhaohui said that through measures such as"" four episodes "", one person and one strategy, and the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine, the diseased rate of COVID-19 severe patients was significantly reduced.  ""We hope to reduce severe cases through the mechanism of early screening of patients and move forward movement."" Du Bin said that expert experts from the State Council will go to designated hospitals to discuss the treatment of intensive treatment. It may develop patients with severe illnesses and provide treatment suggestions.  Ma Xiaochun said that in the process of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic, my country has always regarded severe medicine as an important discipline and incorporated it into the full management of patient treatment. Before some patients become severe, intensive medicine has been intervened to prevent severe transition from minor; after patients with severe illnesses, they will be treated with designated hospitals and professional severe teams with better hardware. It played a good role.  Always adhere to the people's supremacy, life first  Experts believe that our epidemic prevention and control policies and treatment measures reflect the concept of ""people's supremacy and life first"". Practice has proved that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. In history, our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.  ""The policies and strategies we adhere to the prevention and control of the prevention and control are in order to grasp early, grasp the small, and do our best to protect everyone, including the elderly and basic diseases. There are more serious illness and illness, and promoting economic and social development on the basis of ensuring the safety of people's lives and health. ""Ma Xiaochun said.  Du Bin recalled a severe treatment experience in personally participating. ""In order to cure a patient with severe illnesses, the National Health and Health Commission transferred me to rush to Kunming, Yunnan. This is a farmer who returned to Kunming after working abroad. It was quickly sent to the intensive care unit. In addition to the rescue of local experts, experts from Beijing and Guangdong also came to reinforcement. After comprehensive treatment, the patient finally turned to safety and was discharged from the hospital. ""Du Bin said.  Tong Zhaohui said that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, experts from the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism and medical staff across the country actively cured patients, even if the illness was severe and the treatment was difficult to give up. ""From the newborn babies to the hundreds of years old people, we all strive for each patient, which fully shows that our party represents the fundamental interests of the most vast people in China, and reflects the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.""",Epidemic prevention and control; designated hospitals; joint prevention joint control; policies and policies;

At present, a total of more than 8.44 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed cases, and more than 30,000 death cases. Professor Hamada Taklang, a professor at Tokyo Medical University in Japan, stated that Japan will enter the seventh wave of epidemic peaks without the end of the sixth wave of the epidemic.  In mid-January this year, the Japanese government relaxed COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment standards and prevention and control measures. From March 21, Japan has lifted the control measures of epidemic affairs across the country, and local governments have successively relaxed the restrictions on the number of dinner people and held large -scale activities. Relaxing the prevention and control of the epidemic has led to the continued increase in diagnosis and death cases of home isolation. In mid -April, the average weekly confirmed cases in the weekly average diagnostic cases in the Iwa, Niigata, Kagoshima and other places were innovative. According to Japanese media reports, during the peak of the epidemic, medical institutions generally operated overload, and normal medical demand was affected, and national health was threatened.  According to data recently released by the Ministry of Health and Labor, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and the Ministry of Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Welfare showed that in the first quarter of this year, at least 555 COVID-19 patients in Japan died at home, of which nearly 70 % died during the quarantine after diagnosis. In the case of death, 89%of the elderly over 60 years old. Japan's ""Daily News"" reported that although some of these home isolation death cases were not asymptomatic, they died soon within 24 hours; some people were judged by the attending doctor without hospitalization, but they died within a few days. Many family members of the deceased expressed dissatisfaction with medical institutions in a timely manner.  According to Japan Economic News, the sequelae of the infection of the Omirjon strain are more obvious among the Japanese young age groups. The Pingji Clinic in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan has outpatient clinics that specialize in treating COVID-19 sequelae. After the clinic statistics on patients with the sequelae of Omircor's strain in the first quarter of this year, they found that patients 20 to 49 accounted for 77%of all 258 patients, of which patients aged 20 to 39 showed an upward trend. Patients with sequelae of the strain increased due to headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc., which were forced to suspend work from 40%to 50%before.  Kumana, the president of the Japanese Fuji, said in an interview with the Asahi Shimbun that the sixth wave of epidemic was completely different from the epidemic caused by Delta's strains. Elderly people will have inhaled pneumonia or cannot eat. People who have unhealthy kidneys and hearts will deteriorate the disease due to pneumonia symptoms. Luye Lang believes that this is by no means a simple flu. If measures are not taken to reduce virus transmission, the Japanese medical system will be unsustainable due to overload operation.

At the same time, stabilizing the macroeconomic market, strengthening and stable employment and employment will ensure the consumption capacity of residents. In addition, the promotion of consumption policies and effectiveness, my country's consumption recovery situation is expected to continue.  The monthly industrial growth rate has been increased from increasing, but the trend of industrial upgrading has not changed  In April, industrial production was affected by the epidemic. Due to the blocked traffic logistics, the industrial production declined, and the added value of industrial industries above designated size fell by 2.9%year -on -year. Among them, manufacturing fell 4.6%.  ""The decline in the growth rate of manufacturing is mainly affected by the equipment manufacturing industry such as automobiles.""

In April, the added value of industries above designated size in the central and western regions increased by 4.6%and 5.6%year -on -year.  “当前，工业生产确实面临一定压力，主要表现在市场需求不足、产销衔接水平下降、产业链供应链存在一些堵点、生产循环不畅、生产成本上升、营利能力下降。”付凌晖说， Despite difficulties, the characteristics of my country's industrial system and strong supporting capabilities have not changed. In the next stage, with the control of the epidemic, transportation and logistics gradually opened up, and the production cycle improvement, especially the continuous efforts of tax cuts, and the continuous efforts of helping enterprises' rescue policies will help boost corporate confidence, improve corporate operations, promote industrial production production Continuous recovery.

From January to April, manufacturing investment increased by 12.2%year -on -year, faster than all investment growth.  Consumption is expected to gradually recover, and online consumption and upgrade consumption will still become an important support for consumption. Fu Linghui explained that from the two years of experience in the epidemic, once the epidemic was effectively controlled, the normal life order was restored, and the suppressed consumer demand would be quickly released. ""In the next stage, the efforts to stabilize the job and stabilize the job, and the overall stable employment of employment is conducive to ensuring residents' income and residents' consumption capabilities; some traditional contact consumption will accelerate the transfer to online, and the situation of residents' consumption upgrade will continue increase.""  Although exports are facing some pressure, there are still many favorable conditions for continuous growth. my country's industrial system is complete, the manufacturing capacity has strong supply capacity, can quickly adapt to changes in external demand, and unswervingly expand opening up, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with trade partners, and promote the construction of the free trade zone, which is conducive to expanding exports.

When the COVID-19 death cases in the United States reached one million, all circles in the United States recently expressed their grief in various ways. In the capital Washington Special Economic Zone, the National Cathedral sounded 1,000 bells in the twilight, lasting for 90 minutes. This bell is not only commemorating mourning, but also alert torture. The United States has the richest medical resources and medical care capabilities in the world, but has caused millions of people to die in COVID-19 within 27 months. The failure of the US anti-epidemic policy is enough to make people see the hypocrisy of American human rights.  Facing the century's epidemic, adhering to the people's supremacy, life first, and truly respecting every life is the greatest respect and best protection of human rights. However, American politicians inaction and chaos have led to the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the number of death cases in the world for a long time. The number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States is almost twice as many ass of the United States' deaths in the two World War, which is equivalent to the total population of San Jose, the tenth largest city in the United States. ""Every deceased left a pain for people."" ""Each number represents that we have lost a grandparents, a lover, or a person with their own unique stories."" American media pointed out. The ""national tragedy"" appeared will be ""always recorded in historical books.""  Looking back at the process of being reduced to the ""Failure of Echigraphy"", it can be clearly seen that American politicians adhere to political and private priority. In order to protect the interests of votes, American politicians deliberately dilute the risk of the epidemic. The so-called COVID-19 is a ""large influenza"", the mortality rate is ""very low"", and the epidemic will ""miraculously disappear"" and other remarks. From nucleic acid detection, wearing masks to maintaining social distance, from medical strategic reserves allocation, formulating emergency relief bills to promoting vaccination, the United States has always attacked each other, veto, confrontation. The overall situation of the epidemic was scrambled by the politics of all parties. The so -called human rights in some American politicians are just flowers and water in the mirror for the American people under the epidemic.  This is another important reason for the failure of public health and safety in public health and health and health. According to reports, the White House COVID-19 virus response working group and the National Security Council cooperated in February 2020 to prepare a memorandum memorandum, which is clearly recommended to take a series of strict control measures. However, the US government decision -making level immediately rejected the memorandum after learning that the relevant measures could lead to the collapse of the US stock market. In the eyes of some politicians in the United States, capital interests are much higher than that of the people's life and health, so that ""the elderly should take the initiative to sacrifice for the economy"" and other absurd remarks. The White House COVID-19 virus response working group, the coordinator of the working group, admitted in the new book that the United States could have greatly reduced the number of deaths through better leadership, but the facts were the opposite.  The people's life and health rights are unequal due to the differences in skin tone, age, and wealth. This is the truth of American human rights exposed in the epidemic. Studies in American universities show that the epidemic has led to the average expected life expectancy of African and Latin Americans in the United States and Latin America. The Associated Press reporter analyzed the data and found that among the million COVID-19 deceased, the elderly 65 and over accounted for about 3/4. The U.S. Poor Rights Organization issued a report stating that the overall mortality rate in the poverty -stricken counties in the United States is almost twice that of the rich county, and of the 300 counties with the highest mortality rate, the average 45%of the population lives below the poverty line. When answering the problem of obvious fairness in the prevention and control of the U.S. epidemic situation, then the US leader once said ""this is life"", which deeply reflects the ""social Darwinism"" gene deeply in the United States. Dabra Five -Holden, a epidemiologist in Michigan State University in the United States, bluntly stated that it is easy to accept the loss of the elderly and ethnic groups such as the elderly and ethnic minorities.  Human rights are not slogans, and protection of human rights should be reflected in specific actions. Recently, the number of new cases and the number of inpatient cases in the United States has reappeared for the increase in the number of inpatient cases. Faced with the still severe epidemic situation, if American politicians really care about human rights, they should seriously learn the painful lessons of the death of millions of life and effectively protect the people's life and health rights.",American people; death case; life health; average life expectancy;

However, the choice of ""lying flat"" not only caused the medical resources of these countries to be crowded out, the medical system continued to undergo pressure, and large -scale infections also caused long -term and continuous negative effects on social and economic operations.  Since February this year, some European countries such as Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland have successively lifted the restrictions on the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, the virus is still mutating, the epidemic continues to spread, the cases and death cases of these countries have continued to rise, and some countries have reached the highest value since the epidemic. Many professionals criticized the ""lying"" policy and called on the government to be more patient and be careful to relieve relevant measures.  Relax prevention and control leads to dual climbing in infection and death cases  Britain began to implement the ""Coexistence with COVID-19 virus"" plan in late February, and the epidemic situation deteriorated sharply. The thorough ""lying"" policy led to the heavier British medical system. In April, the national hospital bed occupation rate reached 94%.  According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of the United Kingdom, in early April, the British COVID-19 virus infection rate continued to rise. In April, the number of people infected in the country in April exceeded 4.9 million, which continued to be at the highest level since the epidemic. COVID-19 deaths have increased for eight consecutive weeks. As of April 29, the number of deaths reached 1,247. Data show that as of late April, 90 % of the people in England had infected at least once infected with COVID-19 viruses, of which more than half were infected after the popular Omircodon strain.  Denmark and Sweden announced on February 1st and 9th, respectively, and announced the cancellation of all epidemic restrictions, including taking public transportation and no need to wear masks. After the Norwegian government announced on February 1, it was further canceled and maintained on the 12th. Social distance, self -isolation and other restrictions; on February 25, Iceland announced a comprehensive cancellation of epidemic prevention measures.  However, the lifting of epidemic prevention measures has led to a severe rebound in the Northern European countries, and new hospitalization cases and death cases have quickly set the highest record since the outbreak of the epidemic. At present, it is still significantly higher than the peak of the epidemic caused by the Delta strain last year.  Sweden's cumulative confirmed cases of diagnosis have reached 2%, which is equivalent to one of more than 500 people died of COVID-19, which is much higher than the average level of 1.24%worldwide. Since it was announced on February 9th, an average of 193.5 people died of COVID-19 per week.  In just ten days after Denmark fully liberalized the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of cases and death cases rose straight. On February 13th, 7,970 people were diagnosed with a new high of 7,970 people, exceeding the record of December 2020; 4.92 deaths per day per 1 million people were much higher than the previous record.  Data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health showed that two days before the announcement of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of newly confirmed cases in the country was 26,109 and 25086, respectively, setting the highest record.  After a comprehensive lifting of epidemic prevention measures, Iceland once reached 4,300 cases, setting a new high number of new confirmed cases in a single day. The largest hospital in Iceland has also announced an emergency state to respond to the surge in the admission of COVID-19 viruses and the number of severe persons.  The long -term economic and social consequences cannot be underestimated  After choosing a thorough ""lying"", the rapidly increasing COVID-19 patients poured into the hospital to allow the medical system to operate overload; due to the infection of COVID-19, a large number of absences and related sequelae are caused Not to be underestimated.  COVID-19 patients and medical staff who asked for leave due to infection viruses surged, which led to the difficulty of running the British medical system and frequent crises. The British ""Financial Times"" analyzed that in April, the number of empty beds in Hospital in England fell to the lowest since the epidemic, with only 5.4%of beds. There are 200,000 absence medical staff of the British national health service system every week. At present, 6.2 million patients in the England region alone are on non -emergency treatment lists.  According to statistics, 1.7 million people in Britain have ""COVID-19 long-term symptoms"", of which 2/3 of them are affected by daily life, and 1/5 people have a serious limitation of activity capabilities, which will bring long-term pressure on the British medical system Essence According to statistics, since the announcement of the ""lying"" policy, British hospitals, schools, and enterprises have generally reported that about 1/10 employees are absent from their diligence due to the infection of the COVID-19 virus. Operation.  The British media recently quoted a survey that the 1/4 British company said that the COVID-19 epidemic was the main reason for the shortage of corporate employees. The report from the Tony Blair Global Change of Tony Blair showed that the reduction of labor force and sequelae caused by the infection of the COVID-19 virus will lead to a decline in social productivity, and it is expected that the British economy will shrink by about 1%.  The latest data released by Sweden shows that more than 640,000 Swedish are waiting in line to be treated. Among them, more than 200,000 people waited more than statutory time. Swedish Minister of Health Lina Haren Galen said: ""The epidemic has brought historical pressure to the Swedish medical care system. Many nursing services have to be postponed and the staff can bear great pressure."" Data from the Swedish Bureau of Statistics show that recently, The number of absence employees related to the COVID-19 epidemic reached 140,000, and the number of absences continued to increase, which caused continuous negative impact on the economy and society.  In Denmark, although 62%of residents have vaccinated the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, after choosing to ""lie down"" completely, COVID-19 severe patients have increased significantly. The Danish medical system was forced to postpone all non-emergency surgery in order to treat patients with COVID-19 priority.  Camilla Stoltenberg, director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said: ""In the past week, the number of people infected with COVID-19 has increased by 40%, which has caused tremendous pressure on the intensive care unit.""  Sorcelo Gednerson, the chief epidemiologist of Iceland, recently acknowledged that in the first quarter of this year, the number of deaths related to COVID-19 far exceeded expectations. In 2020 and 2021, due to strict implementation of epidemic prevention measures, the mortality rate for the elderly over the age of 70 in Iceland has remained at a lower level.  Professionals call for caution to relieve epidemic prevention measures  Many professionals have criticized ""lying down"" completely. The British ""Nature"" magazine published a research report in March this year, criticizing the Swedish government to respond to the ""very bad"" response to the epidemic, and the group's immunity was ""unable to achieve"". The report pointed out: ""Sweden's response to the COVID-19 epidemic is unique, and its characteristics are that they are too free in morality, ethics and science.""  Earlier, more than 2,000 people in the British scientific community issued a joint public letter asking the government to restart epidemic prevention measures. British Prime Minister Johnson also said that he does not rule out the possibility of ""sealed the city"" again due to the epidemic.  Frend Furland, an expert at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, believes that it is very dangerous to expect to disseminate virus transmission to achieve group immunity. Elg, a professor at the University of Merio at the University of Merio, said that the epidemic is still a major threat to Swedish society. The government should be more patient and should not be urgent to relieve epidemic prevention measures.  ""British Medical Magazine"" recently commented that lolicizing epidemic prevention measures is to ""restore normal order"", but it is ironic that this policy has triggered a larger chaos. With the complete lifting of the epidemic prevention and control measures, the tracking volume and large-scale free detection volume of close contacts decreased, and the COVID-19 virus infection rate has soared significantly. Increased patient employees have caused serious hindrance to all aspects of social life. ""  Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds University in Britain, believes that, instead of ""coexisting"" with COVID-19 viruses, Britain is ""coexisting"" as COVID-19 viruses. ""Abandoning measures such as large -scale detection and infection isolation, we will never achieve the level of low infection. The antibodies produced by the vaccine continue to weaken with time. Infection, the covid-19 epidemic is still a major challenge for public health. ""  (Our newspaper London, Stockholm Electric)",Public health; epidemic prevention measures;

The current situation of the capital epidemic is severe and complicated. Social screening found that there are still cases of concealment, bringing uncertainty to the prevention and control of the capital epidemic. Beijing further refined the ""four -party responsibility"" and grasped the ""last 100 meters"" in practice.  Return to the time, and the case is covered as soon as possible. Beginning on May 13th, Beijing used the weekend window period to carry out nucleic acid screening on 12 areas for 3 consecutive days. The majority of Beijing citizens actively responded to the call of home office, participating in nucleic acid testing in an orderly manner, and standardized wearing masks and maintaining two meters of line interval. As of now, there are 9694 sampling points and 22,447 sample tables in 12 regions in Beijing, and the testing work is tight and orderly.  The sieve tube is used together to resolutely prevent the leakage of the pipe from control. Today, Haidian District announced that a nucleic acid testing positive personnel are bus flight attendant administrators of bus stations, which has attracted attention. The results of this employee's multiple nucleic acid detection results from April 25th to May 10th were negative, and the test results of nucleic acid detection in social screening on May 11 were positive. According to reports, Haidian District and Bus Group announced relevant information to the society overnight, and quickly arranged the situation of drivers, flight attendants and other personnel who entered the stations since May 5th. So far 14 people. Relevant departments conduct nucleic acid testing on relevant personnel and environment, and conduct multiple rounds of disinfection work on all operating vehicles in the station to ensure that the operation work is safe and orderly.

How to view the current economic situation in China? How to ensure that economic operations remain in a reasonable range? The reporter interviewed Sheng Laiyun, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the National Bureau of Statistics.  Stable expectations, we must ""solidify the root, stabilize policies, relieve difficulties, and activation""  Reporter: The just -released April Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) and non -manufacturing business activities index are declining. What do you think of the expected problem of market players?  Shenglaiyun: Weakness is expected to be a relatively prominent problem in the current economic operation. In April, the manufacturing PMI and non -manufacturing business activities index fell to 47.4%and 41.9%, and the situation of the weakening of enterprises was relatively obvious. Weakening market expectations is the result of the intersection of internal and external factors and the common impact of long -term factors.  From the perspective of external factors, the world economy has shifted to high inflation, high interest rates, high debt, high cost, and low -growth category ""stagflation"" high -risk models, and unstable uncertain factors increase. At the same time, there are many geopolitical incidents such as the Ukraine crisis, and public health incidents have frequently occurred. The policy of turning in major economies has accelerated, which has a great impact on global economic operations and capital flows.  From the perspective of internal factors, the pain of economic transformation is still continuing, the conversion of new and old kinetic energy is not smooth, coupled with the impact of the epidemic, the market demand is insufficient, the production logistics costs are not good, the production costs of enterprises have risen significantly. Increase. These have a significant impact on market confidence and corporate expectations.  Reporter: How to reverse the situation of weakening expectations?  Shenglaiyun: Stable expectations must be multi -pronged, long -term combination, symptomatic medicine, and long -term contribution, especially ""solidifying fundamentals, stabilizing policies, relieving difficulties, and activation.""  ""Fundamental"" is to focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic market. Strengthen macro -control, quickly plan the incremental policy tools, solidly stabilize the economy, and strive to achieve the main expected goals of economic and social development throughout the year. ""Stability policy"" is to maintain the continuity of the policy. The more difficult it is, the more you need to maintain a certain force to pass clear and stable policy signals to the market, which will help market players planning early, early decision -making, and early action. ""Difficulty"" is to increase the assistance of market entities and difficult groups in difficulties, and to implement a package of rescue measures early and implement a package of bailout measures early. ""Activity"" is to unswervingly promote reform and innovation, promote the reform of ""decentralization of management"", create a better development environment for enterprises, and allow enterprises to enjoy more reform dividends.  The economic growth rate has slowed down, but the direction of high -quality development has not changed  Reporter: Recently, the epidemic is more distributed. How do you evaluate the impact of the current epidemic on the Chinese economy?  Shenglaiyun: This round of epidemic really has a huge impact on the Chinese economy. In March, the total retail sales of consumer goods in the country, the production index of the service industry from increasing to decline, the production and logistics were blocked, the volume of freight in the whole society fell by 2.2%, and the number of courier business decreased by 3.1%. The value added of industries above designated size in Shanghai and Jilin decreased by 10.9%and 36.7%year -on -year, and the retail sales of consumer goods above the limit decreased by 18.2%and 69.9%, respectively.  Although the epidemic has a great impact on the production and life of some areas, in general, it is staged, short -term, and external. As the policy effects of high -efficiency overall preparations and economic and social development have gradually emerged, the impact of the epidemic is expected to gradually weaken. Economic activities that are suppressed in the early stage will continue to be released. The economy is expected to usher in the inflection point of recovery. Judging from the situation in May, the epidemic in Jilin, Shanghai and other places has been effectively controlled, the re -production and re -production are promoted in an orderly manner, and some advance indicators such as the power consumption have changed positive changes.  Observing China's economic operation, we must look at and dialectically. We must not only see the ""shape"" of short -term fluctuations, but also the ""potential"" of long -term development. In the short term, some indicators fell more, mainly the result of the impact of the epidemic. From the perspective of the overall situation, the economic stable development and long -term good fundamentals have not changed, especially the general trend of structural adjustment and transformation and upgrading and high -quality development. In March, the value -added value of high -tech manufacturing above designated size increased by 13.8%year -on -year, and the production index of information transmission, software and information technology service industry increased by 12.8%, and new economic momentum was still growing rapidly. This shows that although the economic growth has slowed down, the direction of high -quality development has not changed. It can be said that ""the shape is fluctuating and the momentum is still good."" The giant wheel of the Chinese economy is splitting waves on the right route.  Multiple measures and implementation to ensure that the economic operation is maintained in a reasonable range  Reporter: How to view the economic trend of the year?  Shenglaiyun: From the perspective of the whole year, although many difficulties and challenges may be faced, the basic characteristics of my country's economy are stable and good, and long -term good fundamentals have not changed. Change, stabilize the macroeconomic market, and achieve more favorable conditions for the development of development expectations.  From the perspective of supply support, my country's social productivity level has continued to increase, and the total grain output has stabilized more than 1.3 trillion kg for 7 consecutive years. The value -added of manufacturing has ranked first in the world for 12 consecutive years, and the industrial chain supply chain is strong. From the perspective of demand support, my country has a population of 1.41 billion and has the most growing domestic market in the world. From the perspective of policy support, my country's government has low deficit rates, overall debt is controllable, and has many policy tools. At present, macro policies are continuously increasing. Increasing policy tools are planning to plan, and the stabilization of growth policies is expected to further show its efforts.  More importantly, we have the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the significant advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, a good situation of long -term harmony and stability in society, and rich experience in macro -control and social governance. Therefore, as long as we are all attentive and overcome difficulties, we will unswervingly implement the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, and we will be able to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  Reporter: How can macro policies be used for employment, stabilizing prices, and stabilizing market players?  Shenglaiyun: The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently held a comprehensive deployment of economic work in the next stage. Now the key is to implement and achieve practical results, and to ensure that the economic operation is maintained in a reasonable range.  The first is to insist on adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. We must deeply, complete, and comprehensively understand the policies and policies of the epidemic prevention and control determined by the Party Central Committee, deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of the resistance and struggle, always maintain a sober mind, unwavering to adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-COVID"" general policy, and do a good job of doing it. ""Foreign defense input and internal prevention"", resolutely consolidate the results of the hard -to -control prevention and control of epidemic.  The second is to increase the policy of steady growth. It is necessary to play a key role in effective investment. From historical experience, expanding infrastructure investment is the most useful move to deal with short -term economic difficulties. From the perspective of the reality of our country, there is still a very wide space investment in infrastructure. The existing per capita infrastructure of my country is equivalent to 20%to 30%of developed countries, and the per capita railway business mileage is 30%of the United States. It is even more promising that the number of 5G mobile phone users in my country accounts for only about 20%of the total number of mobile phone users, and the consumption of clean energy consumption such as natural gas and water nuclear landscapes accounts for only about 25%of the total energy consumption.  The third is to effectively stabilize the market subject. Starting from the actual difficulties faced by market entities, especially small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households, use a variety of policy means such as tax refund, tax reduction, social security premiums, special funds for bailout, and inclusive small and micro loans.

Social screening still has cases of concealment, and the current capital epidemic prevention and control is still uncertain. On May 11, the nucleic acid screening of Beijing City was 15.97 million, of which 8 tubes were positive. Beijing insisted on the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. On May 12, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint control joint control coordination mechanism decision: starting from May 13th, continuous continuously, continuously Three days to carry out nucleic acid screening in 12 districts; refined the shortcomings of the vulnerabilities in the prevention and control work, and refined the specific measures to further compact the ""four -party responsibility"". The sieve tube was tightly tightened, and Beijing went all out to cut off the virus spread chain at the fastest speed.  Beijing has recently involved enterprises and construction sites in Beijing. Beijing's refinement has proposed specific measures to further compact the ""Quartet responsibility"". Three requirements are proposed in the responsibility of the main body of the unit: First, master basic information, establish normalized basic information accounts for various personnel information, and ensure that ""the source can be traced and the whereabouts can be chased."" The second is to strengthen personnel management and do a good job of liquidity prevention management of linear engineering personnel, security, cleaning, clock workers, decoration workers, express delivery brothers and other brothers. The supervision and inspection of personnel dense places will reasonably reduce personnel density. The third is to do a good job of emergency response. After the epidemic occurs in this unit, it is necessary to report to the industry authorities and territories as soon as possible, and quickly set up special classes for epidemic disposal to deal with them. Streaming traceability, settlement screening, inspection and control and other work.  In terms of compacting the management responsibilities of the industry, we will effectively strengthen the management and supervision and inspection of the internal and system in the industry, in -depth search for risk vulnerabilities, strengthen the construction of emergency response capabilities, and urge the units of the epidemic to fully cooperate with the epidemic disposal.  In terms of compacking the responsibility of the ground pocket, the districts are required to be responsible for the prevention and control of territorial epidemic situations, comprehensively understand the number of units, enterprises and other institutions and personnel in the jurisdiction, establish a daily contact communication and docking mechanism, and urge the implementation of normalization prevention and control requirements. Immediately after the epidemic occurred, coordinated treatment was carried out, and fixed -point treatment, observation observation, flow traceability, and nucleic acid testing were done.  In terms of compacting the responsibility of personal epidemic prevention, personnel are required to be prompted by the immune -related information, visited the point -related risk point, and the intersection of the short track of the person in the immune -related risk. Report to the unit and community (village) as soon as possible. After receiving the information of the risk personnel such as secret, sub -dense connection, you must not move in place and cooperate with the disposal.

Promoting resumption of work, the city's ""fireworks"" is gradually returning ... After the joint efforts of all parties, the trend of the Shanghai epidemic has stabilized, the epidemic spread has been effectively controlled, and the epidemic prevention and control have achieved phased results. This is a powerful confirmation of the scientific and effectiveness of the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and it is a strong refutation to the ""lying"" theory.  Since the end of February of this year, the strong and contagious Omikon variants have spread rapidly. There are many epidemic points, a wide range of outbreaks, and frequent occurrences. my country's epidemic prevention and control work has faced the most severe test since Wuhan's defense war. Facing the repeated impact of the epidemic, some biased voices are worthy of vigilance, or after thinking that infection of the mutant strain of Omikon, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infection can choose ""let go""; It is better to let it go as it is difficult to prevent; or it is considered that the cost of prevention of epidemic prevention is not necessary. All these are the so -called ""lying flat"" strategies that can coexist with the virus. In this regard, we must be soberly realized that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best solution, and ""lying"" will definitely pay a huge price.  When measuring the harm of a large epidemic disease, the perspective of the group is the most important. At present, my country's COVID-19 vaccination is progressing smoothly, but the vaccination rate of the elderly and children is not high enough. The number of elderly people over 60 years of age has only 81.67%of the elderly population. And the barrier of death. With the total population base of more than 1.4 billion people in my country and the real national conditions of the huge elderly groups, if the epidemic dissemination is disseminated, a large number of severe cases and death cases will be occurred, and the medical resources of the country will eventually cause the unbearable losses of the people's lives and property. Essence At the same time, relaxation prevention and control will greatly increase the risk of virus mutation, and new mutant strains may bring new threats after the emergence of the appearance.  In fact, the reason why some countries choose to let go of prevention and control is because they cannot find the ideal strategy to control the epidemic, and the complex factors such as economic downturn and anti -epidemic fatigue mentality, ""lying flat"" is actually a helpless choice. However, the consequences brought by the number of cases and the high number of cases of death. Some countries have announced the ""coexistence with COVID-19 virus"" plans. After losing all restricted measures in the legal sense, the epidemic has continued to deteriorate, the level of infection has risen to the highest history, which brings heavy pressure on the medical and health system. At present, its medical system is still in State of difficult operation. Some countries have more than 1 million cases of COVID-19 deaths due to the spread of virus, and more than 200,000 children died in the COVID-19 epidemic due to their parents or other guardians, and they were unfortunately reduced to ""COVID-19 orphan"". When the global epidemic has not yet improved the substantive improvement, choosing ""lying flat"" is undoubtedly indifferent to science, the complexity and arduous contempt of the fight against epidemic, and the extreme irresponsibility of the public's life and health rights. This also reveals that ""lying down"" cannot ""lie down"" and will lose the difficult and control results of my country's early period.  From an economic perspective, strict prevention and control measures on the fierce epidemic will inevitably have a temporary impact on economic and social development. However, it must be realized that only when the epidemic is effectively controlled, economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. We should be confidently seen that my country's epidemic prevention and control has a good cost -effective ratio. In 2020, it was because of my country's ""the first to control the epidemic"" and ""the first to resume work and re -production"", and eventually ""the first to achieve economic growth from negative to positive"" in major economies; in 2021, my country's economy increased by 8.1%year -on -year, two years in two years The average increase of 5.1%, the economic development and epidemic prevention and control remained the world's leading position. In the first quarter of this year, my country's GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year, the growth rate was higher than 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The overall economic operation achieved a stable start. This is irrefutable that effective epidemic prevention and control is a powerful guarantee for economic development. Stable epidemic prevention results can create a stable and safe development environment for economic growth. Choosing ""lying flat"" will inevitably have a serious impact on economic and social development, and it will inevitably cause greater losses.  ""Lying flat"" has no way out, and persistence is victory. The British ""Daily Telegraph"" website recently published an article stating: ""If the final death is calculated, China's mortality rate is likely to be lower than most countries, and the price paid for it is much smaller."" Looking around the world, at present, at present, at present There are still a handful of countries with ""discovery and extinguishing together"" conditions. ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is still the best choice based on my country's current epidemic situation at this stage. Practice has proved that our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective. Maintaining strategic determination, firm confidence, grasping the foundation early, discovering and extinguishing together, we must be able to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, minimizing the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development.",epidemic prevention and control; vaccination; prevent and control measures; science and effective;

Li Guoping, director of security director of the Ministry of Transport, introduced the latest situation of logistics insurance and the smooth work at the State Council's policies.  Since March this year, the domestic epidemic has been frequent, and the control measures taken by trucks in some areas have caused obstacles to traffic, vehicle stays, and poor logistics. ""The Ministry of Transport earnestly implements the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, closely coordinated the department and strengthened the provincial linkage to promote the work of logistics insurance and the smooth work."" Li Guoping introduced the relevant progress: from April 21 The closed toll station continued to control the service area within 20 and shut down service areas. On May 4th, the first temporary closed highway toll station ZERO-COVID target was achieved for the first time.  As the toll stations and service areas are fully resumed and the logistics is blocked rapidly, the traffic traffic of the nation's highway, especially trucks, has continued to rise steadily. Li Guoping said that on May 10, a total of 21.8773 million units across the country's highway, an increase of 26.39%over April 10. Among them, the traffic flow was 7.213 million, an increase of 25.65%over April 10. In addition, railway cargo delivery, highway freight volume, and main port cargo throughput on May 10 increased by 5.71%, 6.16%, and 1.12%from April 18; More than 80 % before the epidemic; the cargo and postal throughput of Shanghai Pudong Airport rose to more than 60 % before the epidemic.  In April this year, in order to ensure the rapid and convenient traffic of key supplies and vehicles, my country has launched a unified type of transportation vehicle pass. ""At present, 27 provinces have successively launched a unified type of pass to play a positive role in ensuring the transportation of key materials."" Han Jinghua, the person in charge of the Transport Services Department of the Ministry of Transport, specifically stated at the meeting that the two ends of the transportation of transportation are not at the epidemic situation. Vehicles that prevent and control key areas, or are not carried out of key supplies, do not need to apply, apply, and use the pass. Vehicles in various places should take effective measures to ensure that the vehicle is prioritized and fast. ""  In order to ensure the transportation of agricultural resources and agricultural products, the Ministry of Transport has recently adopted a series of measures to ensure that ordinary highways, especially rural highways, are unblocked. Wang Tai, the person in charge of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, told reporters that after a comprehensive investigation, the ""microcirculation"" of my country's rural highways is generally unblocked and no serious blocking problems have been found. Without approval, the behavior of digging the rural highway without authorization, strictly standardize the setting of rural highway epidemic prevention inspection points, optimize and improve control measures, improve the efficiency of epidemic prevention inspection, and maintain the normal production and living order of the people. ""  Looking forward to the next stage of work, Han Jinghua believes that with the changes in the epidemic situation, the problem of over -control control of trucks may still be repeated. ""We will continue to strengthen the tracking and supervision, guide localities to strictly implement the vehicle traffic guarantee measures, and effectively ensure that the truck is smoother.""  At the same time, the Ministry of Transport will also go all out to do a good job of logistics and protection in key areas such as the Yangtze River Delta and other outbreaks of the Yangtze River Delta. The first is the stable supply of biological capitals. Give full play to the important role of pass permits in the transportation of people's biological supplies, implement ""one certificate registration, one certificate review, and one certificate"", and realize ""fast inspection, fast detection, and fast pass"". The second is to protect the production and operation of key enterprises. For enterprises that include the ""white list"" of key enterprises, take measures such as priority capacity support, priority testing services, priority arrangement of loading and unloading, and preferred distribution. The third is to maintain the normal operation of key hubs. Strengthen the coordinated linkage of the Yangtze River Delta region to ensure the smooth flow of Shanghai Port Settlement, and increase the transportation and transportation volume of Pudong Airport. The fourth is the end logistics distribution of Baocheng City.

Since the beginning of this year, the international situation has become more complicated and severe, and the domestic epidemic has also shown the characteristics of many, wide and frequent, and has increased its impact on the impact of economic operation. In the face of multiple challenges, my country's economy has achieved ""opening the door steadily"". In the first quarter, the GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year. The national economy continued to restore the development trend, and the economic operation was generally stable. The main macro indicators remained in a reasonable range.

It is the growth of the maximum reduction under the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development. It is precious, and firm confidence has increased confidence. Maintaining economic operations in a reasonable range and striving to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development throughout the year. Although we have a lot of challenges and heavy tasks, we are full of confidence and strong confidence.  The difficult road is uphill. Affected by the current epidemic, demand shrinkage, impact on supply, and expected weak triple pressure are more prominent, and new downward pressure has further increased. Facing the risk challenges on the road, we need to look at my country's development with a comprehensive, dialectical and long -term perspective. From the perspective of development, last year, my country's economic scale exceeded 11.0 trillion yuan, and the per capita GDP exceeded 80,000 yuan, exceeding the world average; from the perspective of supply potential, the industrial structure continued to be adjusted and optimized, and the complete advantages of the industrial system continued to show; The oversized market advantages of more than 1.4 billion people and more than 400 million medium -income groups continued to appear; from the perspective of the policy environment, reforms and regulation of ""combination boxing"" have continued to make efforts, and the stable growth co -operating is accelerating the formation.

We have enough confidence to defeat any difficulty challenges.  my country's economic potential, strong vitality, and policy tools, and abundant new movements allow us to climb the slopes and have confidence and confidence. In the first quarter, the national economy's ""three -driving troiders"" was steadily advanced. The total retail sales of social consumer goods increased by 3.3%year -on -year. The investment in fixed assets increased by 9.3%year -on -year. %. Since entering the second quarter, the policy has been properly advanced.

We have the ability and ability to keep up with downward pressure and stabilize the macro market; to maximize the impact of epidemic situation on the development of the epidemic on economic and social development, and promote high -quality development. We have confidence and conditions.  As the world's most potential market, China has the most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and comprehensive supporting capabilities. Great ... Although the COVID-19 epidemic and Ukraine crisis have led to an increase in risk challenges, the international community is still optimistic about China's economic growth prospects. The International Monetary Fund has lowered the expected global economic growth expectations this year, while still investing in China's economic investment ""trust votes"", and believes that ""China plays an important role in the global economic recovery."" Reports recently released by the German Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China show that 71%of German -funded enterprises and US -funded companies in 2/3 hopes to increase investment in China. The affirmation and expectations of the international community reflect the affirmation of the past achievements of the Chinese economy, and it is also an recognition of a stable trend and profound advantage in the Chinese economy. Facing the Centennial Change Bureau and the Century Epidemium, macro stability has become a scarce resource under the condition of uncertainty of the global economy. Facing the future, we have ""full preparation of tough battles"", and we have the determination and courage to overwhelm all difficulties and not overwhelming the difficulties.

At this time, we need to maintain a sober mind, deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of the struggle against epidemic, overcome the mentality of paralysis, the mood of war, the fluent psychology, and the mental attitude, and insist on adhering to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" general policy. Never let the hard -won epidemic prevention and control results be east.  Fighting with the epidemic is the wrestling of material and the spiritual counterpart; it is a contest of strength and a competition of will. Since the COVID-19 epidemic, my country has taken the lead in controlling the epidemic, the first to resume work, and the first to achieve economic growth in the world's major economies. my country maintains economic development and epidemic prevention and control global leading position, and a stable epidemic prevention and control situation provides a favorable environment. Barry is only half of 90. At present, my country's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage of popularization of Omikon virus variants. We must endure the prevention and control of the epidemic, and always tighten the string of the epidemic prevention and control.  my country is a large country with a population of more than 1.4 billion. It has great benefits and difficulties in the prevention and control of the epidemic. On the one hand, my country is large in depth. When the epidemic occurs in one place, we can mobilize resource support from various parties, so that we have conditions and capabilities to defeat the epidemic. On the other hand, my country's population is huge, the elderly population base is large, and the region is vast. There are differences in medical and health conditions in various places. The vaccination has imbalance between different people. Once the virus spreads across the country, the scale has rebounded. Medical and health resources will face severe risk of crowding. A large number of patients with basic diseases, elderly people, children, and pregnant women will be seriously threatened. The stable economic and social development will be seriously affected. And even abandoned before. If you go against the water, you will retreat if you do not enter. Faced with the dissemination of the mighty Omiroko mutant strains, we must attach great importance to it, deeply understand its potential harmfulness, make great determination, and control the epidemic as soon as possible to avoid causing sustainable social communication.  From the perspective of the virus itself, the Omikon variants not only have the characteristics of strong contagiousness, fast transmission speed, and high hiddenness, but also are constantly mutating. The direction of mutation still has high uncertainty. At the same time, the wider the virus is popular in the crowd, the more copying, the greater the possibility of mutation. At present, many countries have detected BA.4 and BA.5 of Omikon subtypes, and some countries have also found a new subtype BA.1.22 of Omikon strains. The reorganized strains of the subtype BA.1.1 and BA.2. Some virusists issued a warning: In addition to the common mutations, the COVID-19 virus will also evolve rapidly through reorganization. If one Omikon mutant strain is reorganized with another COVID-19 mutant plant Poison that can lead to more serious diseases. In the context of the COVID-19 virus's mutation rules, if relaxing prevention and control will accelerate the spread of the virus and provide a ""hotbed"" for its mutation. In this regard, insisting on dynamic Zero-Covid is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control that we must keep in my country before.  Persistence is victory, unity is strength. The Omikon mutant plant does add a lot of difficulty and severe challenges to the current prevention and control of the epidemic, but it does not mean that it is not possible to do the ""four early"" -the early discovery, early report, isolation, and early treatment. Tianjin, from the epidemic raid on January 8 to announced on January 21, announced the society Zero-Covid, the first large-scale in China faced Omikon to obtain a staged fruit; Shenzhen, from pressing the ""slow line keys"" to social production and life The order began to recover in an orderly manner, and it took less than 10 days ... Practice fully proves that the overall policy of adopting ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" in my country is scientific and effective. We have a completely foundation, conditional, and capable dynamic Zero-Covid. Adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" without hesitation, firm confidence, facing difficulties, and stubbornly fighting, we will be able to maintain and consolidate the results of the hard-controlled epidemic prevention and control, which will effectively and effectively protect the health of the people's lives and economic and social development.

At present, the complexity, severeness, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment have risen. How can the China Banking Regulatory Commission further guide the bank industry insurance industry to increase and improve financial supply, and increase support for the real economy? How to effectively prevent and resolve financial risks and keep the financial system safe and stable? The reporter interviewed Liang Tao, a member of the Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission.  Increase and improve financial supply, and continue to increase support for the real economy  Reporter: Since this year, what measures have the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission guided the banking insurance industry to serve the real economy and how effective? In what aspects will bank insurance institutions increase their support for the real economy?  Liang Tao: The CBRC guides the banking insurance industry to further increase financial support for the real economy, continue to increase the total amount of credit investment, optimize the credit structure, reduce financing costs, and continue to continue the principal and interest policy. In the first quarter of this year, manufacturing loans increased 1.8 trillion yuan, which was 1.7 times the increase in the same period last year. The loan balance of inclusive small and micro enterprises was 2.06 trillion yuan, an increase of 22.6%year -on -year. The balance of high -tech industry loans exceeds 7 trillion yuan. In the first quarter, newly issued corporate loans and inclusive small and micro -enterprise loan interest rates decreased by more than 0.2 percentage points from the beginning of the year.  The current downward pressure on the economy has increased, and the banking insurance industry also encountered some difficulties in the process of supporting the real economy. For example, enterprises with severe impact on the epidemic have unstable operating income and difficult to repay bank loans as scheduled. The pressure of non -performing loans of bank institutions is greater; some enterprises' financing is mainly to maintain existing liquidity. Effective financing demand is relatively atrophic.  Faced with new difficulties and challenges, the next step of the CBRC will guide the bank industry insurance industry to increase and improve financial supply, and encourage large banks and other high -quality listed banks to release more credit resources. Establish and improve the long -term assessment mechanism of insurance funds, enrich the channels for insurance funds to participate in the capital market investment, encourage insurance asset management companies to increase the issuance of portfolio insurance asset management products, guide more funds to allocate equity assets, and continue to increase the pair of rights. The support of the real economy has the following measures:  Effectively increase support for weak links. Guide banks to increase the first loan and credit loan ratio in small and micro -enterprise loans, and continue to reduce loan interest rates. Ensure the steady growth of agricultural credit, and actively develop the first loan and credit loan of new agricultural business entities. Continue to standardize the development of the third pillar pension insurance to promote the improvement of health insurance services.  Promote the reduction of comprehensive financing costs of enterprises. Continuously standardize the charging behavior of banking institutional credit, loan assistance, credit increase and assessment links, and standardize the management of the bank service market to regulate the price management. Do a good job of credit evaluation and review of continuous financing in advance, and effectively reduce the cost of corporate funds.  Improve the level of financial services for new citizens. Guide bank insurance institutions to increase credit support and insurance guarantee for new citizens' entrepreneurial employment, house purchase, education and training, etc.  Implement the policy of helping enterprises' rescue policies and support market entities to relieve liquidity difficulties  Reporter: The state has issued a package of bailout assistance policies for industries and enterprises that have been seriously impacted by the epidemic.  Liang Tao: Since the beginning of this year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission has guided the banking insurance industry to increase the financial support of industries, small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households that have been seriously impacted by the epidemic. Focus on supporting market players to relieve liquidity difficulties.  The first is to continue to increase loan support for small and micro enterprises and rural revitalization. Give full play to the regulatory anti -cyclical regulation, continue to clarify the goal of ""two increases"" of inclusive small and micro -enterprise loans, and the number of households. Among them, the newly added inclusive small and micro enterprise loans this year will reach 1.6 trillion yuan, and urban business Banks have significantly increased the proportion of loans for inclusive small and micro enterprises. The bank is required to help the county's inclined credit resources to the key counties of rural rejuvenation in grain production counties and 160 countries.  The second is to help difficulties in difficult industries through difficulties. Guide to urge bank insurance institutions to take the initiative to do a good job in loan credit and insurance claims, such as catering accommodation, retail, tourism culture, transportation, etc., and increase the tilt of financial resources in difficult industries. Guidance insurance institutions provide insurance to provide insurance protection for the property loss caused by the suspension of production due to the suspension of production and the business interruption. It is required that bank insurance institutions provide strong support for freight logistics and preservation, and provide flexible and convenient ""green channels"" services for transportation companies that undertake epidemic prevention and control and emergency transportation tasks, and reasonably adjust truck drivers, car loans, personal housing mortgage mortgages Wait for repayment arrangements.  The third is to strengthen financial services for regions where the epidemic is seriously affected by the epidemic. Combining the local epidemic prevention and control requirements and changes in the situation of the epidemic situation, guide the local Banking Supervision Bureau to introduce more targeted measures to help enterprises in accordance with local conditions, and coordinate and solve outstanding problems reflected by local industries, enterprises and the masses. For example, the Shanghai Banking Regulatory Bureau has increased the promotion of renewal, improves the efficiency of renewal loans, supports the seamless connection of the financing turnover of small and micro enterprises operating normally, and relieves the pressure of mobile funds.  The banking insurance industry maintains a stable operation, and the risk is generally controllable  Reporter: What impact will the current international and domestic risk challenges increase on the safe and stable operation of my country's banking insurance industry? What measures will be taken to effectively prevent possible risks in the next step?  Liang Tao: The current international situation is full of uncertainty. The tightening policy of developed economies in Europe and the United States may put a certain pressure on my country's cross -border capital flow and RMB exchange rate. At the same time, the price of imported raw materials may also rise, bringing pressure on the production and operation of small and medium -sized enterprises. Therefore, the secure and stable operation of the financial system is essential to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  my country's economy is stable and good, and the fundamental fundamentals have not changed for a long time. The banking insurance industry continues to maintain stable operation, and the risks are generally controllable. In the first quarter, the non -performing loan rate of the banking industry was 1.79%, maintaining a reasonable level; banking institutions continued to increase the handling of non -performing assets, and in the first quarter, it disposed of nearly 600 billion yuan. Insurance companies have maintained a high level of comprehensive settlement capacity and core solvency adequacy ratio, and the overall risk resistance capacity is strong.  At the same time, the risks in key areas are controllable. The real estate credit investment is generally stable, and the development of loans for real estate companies has grown forward for three consecutive months. It orderly meets the reasonable demand for real estate financing. The adverse rate of real estate loans is significantly lower than all loans, and the risk is controlled as a whole. The loans of inclusive small and micro enterprises continue to increase, expand, and reduce prices, and the risks in related fields are also better controlled.  In the next step, the China Banking Regulatory Commission will coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic development, the regulatory policies are advancing, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  The first is to increase financial support for the real economy. Continue to strengthen the credit support and insurance protection of industries and small and medium -sized enterprises, which have a greater influence of the epidemic, support the secure and stable supply chain of the industry chain supply chain. Optimize financial support in key consumer areas, improve the level of financial services for new citizens, support highway transportation construction, play a key role in effective investment, and fully support expanding domestic demand. Improve the financial support innovation system, increase the medium and long -term loans of the manufacturing industry, and better serve the key core technologies of the key core technology and the ""specialized new"" small and medium -sized enterprises.  The second is to resolutely and effectively prevent financial risks. Urges bank insurance institutions to do a good job of risk research, strengthen risk management, and effectively respond to changes in the international economic and financial situation. Further enrich the financial stabilization security fund, give play to the positive role of insurance security funds and trust industry security funds in risk disposal, and build a weaving financial security network.  The third is to actively promote the long -term healthy and stable development of the capital market. Give full play to the advantages of insurance funds for a long time, and guide insurance institutions to allocate more funds in equity assets.

It is necessary to take the fundamental interests of all the people as the fundamental starting point and end of our work. Since the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always adhered to the concept of ""people first, life first"", and the general strategy of ""external prevention input, internal prevention rebound"" After the round of epidemic impact, it has protected people's life safety and health to the greatest extent. Especially since March of this year, after fighting and fighting side by side in the country, we have adopted the most severe epidemic prevention and control test since Wuhan's defense war, and achieved staged results. Practice has once again proved that adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not only a powerful manifestation of respect for science and law, but also an inevitable requirement for the people's supremacy and life first. In the face of protecting the safety of the people, we must at all costs, and we can also do all the costs! Human life is the most valuable. Life is only once.

To curb the epidemic as soon as possible is the true respect for every life, and insisting that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is essentially adhering to the people's supremacy and life supremacy. From the perspective of public sanitation, the entire population is the susceptible crowd of the Omikon mutant strains. Without any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. Omikon variants are by no means a ""large influenza"". The average mortality rate is 7 to 8 times that of ordinary flu. The disease mortality rate of the elderly over 80 years old, especially over 80, is nearly a hundred times more common influenza. From the perspective of the spread of global epidemic, the virus is constantly mutating, and the ultimate direction of the epidemic is still greatly uncertain. International public health experts have pointed out that the epidemic has not yet ended and still needs to be vigilant. Some ""lying"" countries have already paid a heavy price. Judging from the actual situation in my country, the number of elderly population is huge, coupled with a considerable number of children and people who cannot vaccinate the vaccine in contraindications. The vaccination rate has not yet formed a barrier that is sufficient to resist severe and dying. Once the epidemic is relaxed, and the rapid spread of viruses will inevitably cause large -scale people infection, a large number of severe illnesses and diseases, and the consequences are unimaginable. Adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", this is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control of more than 1.4 billion people who must be kept before 1.4 billion.  For a period of time, in all parts of the country, various fronts have adhered to their posts and continuous battles. It has made important contributions. At present, the overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe. There is a risk of rebound in the epidemic. It is necessary to speed up the treatment of local aggregate epidemic, timely improve prevention and control measures, and prepare for epidemic conditions. Persistence can victory. When this critical period and vigorous stage, we particularly cannot relax and need to continue to work hard. Instead of adhering to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", not paralyzed, not tired of fighting, not lucky, not loose, from the inspection to the inspection, the intervals of the intervals, the acceptance of the acceptance, the treatment should be treated, and the treatment should be treated. Do a good job in the supply of basic living security and living materials for the masses, and then to implement the normalization of the normalized epidemic prevention and control measures, you must always carry forward the spirit of hard work and continuous operations.

At present, due to various factors, the difficulties and challenges facing the survival and development of the market entities in my country are increasing. How to stabilize market entities and create a good market environment for them? How to stabilize market order and ensure the production and life of the people? The reporter interviewed Pu Chun, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the State Administration of Market Supervision and Management.  The number of new market subjects remains basically smooth, reflecting the strong toughness and potential of my country's economy  Reporter: Since this year, what is the situation of new market entities in my country? What measures will the next step stimulate the development of the market subject?  Pu Chun: From the perspective of the registration of market entities, the number of new market entities remains basically stable. This is a concentrated manifestation of China's strong toughness and potential in my country.  From January to April this year, my country's new market entities still achieve positive growth on the basis of larger bases. A total of 8.987 million households were set up, a year -on -year increase of 0.7%. Among them, 22,600 new enterprises are set up daily, which is at a high level of history.

""  Grow better in training  Our reporter Cheng Yizheng  ""My youth spent in the construction of the China -Pakistan Economic Corridor. This is a time that makes me proud and unforgettable."" In early 2022, Sun Zhen, a Chinese operating manager of Pakistan Sahivar Coal Power Station, said goodbye Start a new journey of life.  The Sahewal Power Station is about 120 kilometers southwest of the capital of Punjab's capital next to Punish. Larar is one of the economic centers of Pakistan, which has a dense population and a concentration of industries. Frequent power outage has always been a big bottleneck to restrict Lorrier's development. Not only not only in the summer is hot and difficult to live, but many factory companies cannot operate at all. In 2015, the completion of the Sahewal Power Station filled 1/4 of Pakistan's power gap, which greatly guaranteed the power supply in Laler and surrounding areas.  ""Power stations provide electrical protection for 10 million people in the surrounding areas."" Sun Zhen said that the stable operation of this power station is very important for the economic and industrial development of Punjab's Punjab province in Pakistan, and everyone has paid a lot of effort to achieve this goal.  In order to assist Pakistan to solve the problem of technical talents, the power station recruited Pakistani employees from the beginning of operation to help them cultivate their ability in actual work and gradually take over the operation of the power station.  As a Chinese operating manager, half of the team led by Sun Zhen was Pakistani employees, and Hassan was one of them. He has just graduated from college and has a good theoretical foundation, but his actual operation experience is insufficient. In order to ensure the long -term stable operation of the power plant, Sun Zhen taught his experience to Pakistan employees without reservation. ""Cultivate them well is responsible for the future of the power station.""  At the beginning, language was a problem for the exchange of China -Pakistan employees. To this end, Sun Zhen worked hard to learn professional terms, while actively looking for a daily spoken expression of Hazan who was similar to age. Soon, Sun Zhen and Hassan found a common hobby -football. After get off work, they organized the employees of China and Pakistan to watch and play the ball, and everyone became more and more familiar outside the work.  ""Due to a lot of communication, Sun Zhen's English level has improved rapidly, which surprised us. We also actively ask him to ask him about work."" Hassan said. Inadvertently, the problems of poor communication between China -Pakistan employees in the early days of operation were solved.  During the prevention and control of the epidemic, Sun Zhen was appointed as the person in charge of the epidemic prevention work of the power station. He knows that the epidemic prevention work is to ensure that 10 million people can use electricity normally. He said that it is not difficult to formulate epidemic prevention, and it is difficult to ensure that everyone is carefully executed. They seize all opportunities and promote the importance of epidemic prevention to the operation of power stations and the use of electricity guarantee for the surrounding people. There is such a sense of responsibility in my heart, and both employees of China and Pakistan can make meticulous requirements for implementing epidemic prevention.

Fighting the epidemic, firm confidence is important. At present, the global epidemic is still at a high level, the virus is constantly mutating. The ultimate direction of the epidemic is still great uncertainty. The overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe, and there is a risk of rebound. The method is always more difficult than the difficulty, and the determination is always more challenging. From the defense war in Wuhan, to the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, to the full chain of the full chain of the full chain of the battle, we always adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and the first time it will be coordinated with the testing, the tone of the tone, the flow tone The power of transfer, isolation, and treatment, and found, and extinguishing together, it effectively curb the spread of the extensive area of the epidemic and effectively reversed the dangerous momentum of virus spread. More than two years of epidemic prevention and control has proved that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" has maximized the protection of the lives of the people and health of the people, minimizing the impact of the epidemic on the overall economic and social development of the country. OK Re -unify the ideological actions, the prevention and control requirements are implemented, the epidemic defense line is reinforced, the level of capacity is improved, and the confrontation is tightened. Over the shortest time to extinguish the epidemic and achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is a overall battle, and a nation's chess must be adhered to. Only when the epidemic is controlled in an orderly manner can we provide a solid guarantee for the people's life and health, and create favorable conditions for normal production and life. It is necessary to see that since the epidemic occurs, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has accurately grasped the changes in the situation of the epidemic, based on the overall situation, focusing on the overall situation, and comprehensively strengthened the centralized and unified leadership of the epidemic prevention and control. A strategic layout of unified command, comprehensive deployment, and three -dimensional prevention and control, gathered a strong combination of fighting against the disease. When this is the critical period and period of ""going against the water and not entering"", we must unify our thoughts and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, and consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political action with the Party Central Committee. , Group perspective, dynamic perspective to look at the problem, deal with short -term and long -term relationships, local and overall relationships, individuals and groups of relationships, both consider the prevention and control needs of the area in the area, but also consider prevention and control of key areas, prevention and control of the whole country, and the nation's national prevention and control. The influence, firm and powerful, do not slack down, cut off the source of infection at the fastest and most efficient efficiency, do its best to control the scope of the epidemic situation, and strive to win the comprehensive victory of the national epidemic prevention and control.  General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: ""Unity is iron, unity is steel, unity is power. Unity is an important guarantee for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to defeat the road of defeating the advanced road. Among them, party organizations at all levels and the majority of party members and cadres are responsible for keeping the land and abiding by the land.

"""" "".  We must fully realize that we are facing a century-old infectious disease epidemic. The COVID-19 virus is very cunning, and the strains are still mutating. Among the risks and threats brought by the epidemic still exist. Compared with other strains, the pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strain itself has indeed weakened, but it has the characteristics of strong propagation, concealment, asymptomatic infection, etc., which is more likely to cause large -scale spread. Compared with the flu, the spread of the mutant plant of Omikon is much higher than the flu, and the pathogenic rate, especially the mortality of the disease, has also reached 7 to 8 times that of the flu. Threats are by no means ""influenza"" that some people think. The WHO COVID-19 The Big Epidemic Emergency Committee has once again rang the alarm clock again, determining that the COVID-19 virus still brings major dangers to the public health field, and countries must not relax their vigilance. Because of this, we must not look at the harm of Omikon's mutant strains to human communication. We must resolutely abandon the ""Omikon influenza theory"" and break the fantasy of ""no intervention, virus transmission will become slower.""  Seeing rabbits and dogs and dying sheep are for the sake of strategies; From the perspective of public health and the actual situation of our country, the whole population is the susceptible crowd of Omikon's mutant strains. my country is a large country with more than 1.4 billion people. In addition, the regional development is unbalanced, the total amount of medical resources is insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Faced with the repeated impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, if there is an indifferent attitude and adopt the so-called ""lying flat"" strategy coexisting with the virus, medical resources will face the risk of serious crowding. The physical health of the crowd will be threatened, and it will also have a serious impact on economic and social development. If you choose to let go of prevention and control, you will definitely miss the best time to resist the resistance. The final price will be higher, the loss will be greater, and the consequences will be more unimaginable. We must establish a bottom-line thinking, fully recognize the potential harmfulness of the virus, and always keep a high degree of vigilance in the risk of the spread of epidemic, and resolutely abandon the ""COVID-19 virus coexistence theory"".  The normalization of the epidemic is not an isolated policy, but a complex operating system. After experiencing an emergency surrounding stage, the normalization prevention and control exploration stage, and the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" stage of accurate prevention and control of the full chain, at present, my country's epidemic prevention and control entered a comprehensive comprehensive prevention and control. The fourth stage of Zero-Covid "". At this stage, in addition to rapid and accurate, we must pay more attention to comprehensiveness, take some comprehensive prevention and control measures, perform effective combinations and superimposed, implement the stringent, most thorough, and resolute measures to prevent the epidemic from the epidemic. Social spread. In terms of prevention and control measures, you need to find the direction of the main attack, distinguish the priority of preventing and control measures, and control the risk people within the scope of control; Examination, flow, isolation, transfer, and community management and control coordinate and link with various types of information. At the same time, we must deeply realize that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not an absolute ""zero infection"". In practice, it is necessary to continue to optimize and upgrade the prevention and control measures according to the new changes of the virus and the new situation of the epidemic. We must not have a self -righteous mentality, not only prevent the formation of ""air gear"" prevention and control, but also eliminating the practice of simplifying simplification and one -size -fits -all, in order to minimize the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is a very specific job.

At present, the complexity, severe, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment has risen, and it is facing new challenges to stabilize growth, employment, and stabilizing prices.

Chen Yulu: Since the beginning of this year, the People's Bank of China has deployed and deployed in accordance with the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.  The first is the forward -looking reduction, maintaining a reasonable and abundant liquidity in terms of total, maintaining sufficient support for the real economy, increasing the long -term sources of funds for financial institutions, and increasing liquidity investment. The second is to continue the interest rate of the loan market to improve the efficiency of monetary policy conduction. The third is to actively make good use of structural monetary policies, focusing on supporting the service industry and small and micro enterprises that are affected by the influence of manufacturing and epidemic. A few days ago, we have converted two direct monetary policy tools to market -oriented policy tools that support small and micro enterprises. Recently, we have launched three major special re -loans, including 200 billion yuan of scientific and technological innovation and re -loan, 40 billion yuan of inclusive pension special re -loan, increasing 100 billion yuan of re -loan quota to support coal development and enhancement of energy storage, increase energy storage, increase Support for key areas and weak links. The fourth is to maintain the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level. In particular, it is necessary to point out that this year the People's Bank of China paid over 1 trillion yuan in deposit profit in accordance with law, which directly enhanced the financial available financial resources and effectively guaranteed the strength of fiscal expenditure. After the central bank paid profit after fiscal expenditure, it will sink the grassroots and direct market entities. It is expected that the growth rate of the broad currency (M2) of 2022 will be about 0.5 percentage points.  In the next stage, the People's Bank of China will put stable growth in a more prominent position in accordance with the requirements of the epidemic, the economy must be stabilized, and the development of security. Stabilize market expectations, stabilize market entities, stabilize prices, stabilize employment, strive to achieve the annual economic and social development goals, and maintain economic operation in a reasonable range.  The first is to launch 100 billion yuan of re -loans to support corporate financing such as logistics and warehouses, strengthen assistance to freight operators, and provide more powerful financial support for the prevention and control of epidemics and economic and social development.  The second is to increase the support for banks, especially small and medium -sized banks to issue permanent debt, support to increase bank capital levels, and enhance bank credit investment capacity.  The third is to promote financial institutions to continue to reduce charges, benefit enterprises and the people, better play the role of government financing guarantee, and use market -oriented legalization measures to promote the reasonable profit of financial institutions to the real economy.  Actively plan the incremental policy tools, and go all out to support the development of the market entities  Reporter: Affected by the epidemic, it is difficult for small, medium and micro enterprises, individual industrial and commercial households to increase, and the pressure is increased. In the next step, how will the People's Bank of China support the development of market entities?  Chen Yulu: The People's Bank of China has resolutely implemented the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, conscientiously implemented various financial policies, adhered to ""two unshakables"", and supported the support of small and medium -sized enterprises, individual industrial and commercial households as the rearrassment of high -quality development of the real economy. Integrate, research and planning to continue to launch new financial support measures.  Recently, the People's Bank of China and the Foreign Exchange Bureau have issued 23 measures to help enterprises' rescue. These are all targeted policies in accordance with the general concern of market entities. Generally speaking, as financial support continues to increase, policy results are gradually emerging.  In the next step, the People's Bank of China will urge financial institutions to make good use of various financial policies to take the initiative to serve the real economy. The point is to accelerate the implementation of the determined policies and measures, actively plan the incremental policy tools, go all out to support the development of the market entities, and help small, medium and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households through difficulties.  For example, for enterprises such as catering and cultural tourism, accelerate the development of pledge and credit loan products in real estate; for groups that have seriously affected the epidemic, they will be flexibly delayed to repay the repayment time, extend the loan period, delay repayment and other methods to support methods. ; For enterprises such as highway logistics transportation and warehousing, accelerate the implementation of 100 billion yuan of re -loan policy, and reasonably support car loan exhibition or renewal; for scientific and technological enterprises such as ""specialized new"" SMEs, accelerate 200 billion yuan of scientific and technological innovation and re -loan landing to land Implement. At the same time, we must continue to promote the construction of long -term mechanisms for small and micro enterprises ""dare to loan, wish loan, loan, loan, and loan"", optimize the allocation of credit resources, strengthen the empowerment of fintech technology, and strive to improve the financing of small and micro enterprises And convenience.  Chinese financial markets still have a very strong long -term attraction to international investors  Reporter: Since the beginning of this year, the monetary policy of developed economies has shifted to accelerate, and the spillover effect of emerging markets has attracted widespread attention. How to look at the impact of this spillover effect on China's economic and financial?  Chen Yulu: Since the beginning of this year, the turning of the monetary policy of developed economies has been accelerating, and it will inevitably have an overflowing effect on other economies, especially emerging markets. The basic aspect of China's economy is stable and tough, and has the ability to cope with this overflow effect. The first is the steady economic recovery. In 2021, China GDP increased by 8.1%year -on -year and an average increase of 5.1%in two years. It ranked among the top in major global economies. In the first quarter of this year, China GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year. Essence The second is that consumer prices rose moderately. In 2021, China's consumer prices rose by 0.9%year -on -year, and March this year was 1.5%, and inflation pressure was generally controllable. Third, the economic structure is continuously optimized, and the role of domestic demand has improved. The contribution rate of economic growth in the first quarter was 96.3%, which was higher than 79.1%in 2021; the effectiveness of innovation -driven results was significant. %, The growth rate is 7.7 percentage points higher than the industrial added value above the size.  China's financial markets still have a very strong long -term attraction to international investors. On the one hand, compared with developed economies, the actual return rate of China's assets is still high. This is determined by China's potential economic growth and natural interest rates. High investment returns are still an important attraction of China's financial market. On the other hand, China's financial market is an important target for diversified asset allocation. Thanks to the good epidemic prevention and control, the Chinese economy has been resumed earlier, and the domestic economic and policy cycle is not the same as that of other major economies. Essence  In recent years, China's financial industry has made great progress in opening up, and the two -way opening of the financial market has continued to expand. It has created a better environment for foreign capital to enter the Chinese market. International investors' recognition of RMB assets has also continued to increase.

The action is highly consistent with the Party Central Committee, overcoming paralysis thoughts, mood of war, fluke, and elasticity, comprehensively mobilize and comprehensively deploy. With the spirit of the spirit that does not wait at time, the actions that must be in every second must grasp the work of the epidemic.  Since mid -April, my country's epidemic situation has continued to fluctuate as a whole. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, after working together, we have adopted the most severe epidemic prevention and control test since the Wuhan defense war. One of the most important reasons why my country's epidemic prevention and control achieved staged results is that we insist on the fast word, and we must effectively and effectively build the epidemic situation from the strictness, the rapid, and the real prevention and control measures. Prevention and control barrier. Practice fully shows that adherence to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is not hesitant, the attitude is resolute and decisive, the actions are quickly and powerful, and the party's central government decision-making is implemented, and we will be able to win the big battle of the epidemic prevention and control.  At present, the overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe. There is a risk of rebound. It is necessary to resolutely build an epidemic prevention and control barrier and resolutely consolidate the results of the hard -to -control prevention and control of epidemic. ""If you go against the water, you will retreat if you do not enter."" When this critical period and vigorous stage, we need to maintain a sober mind. Sometimes we must not wait for the spirit, and have the sense of responsibility of ""constantly rest assured"". It is necessary to deeply realize that the global epidemic is still at a high level, the virus is constantly mutating, and there is still great uncertainty in the end of the epidemic. my country is a large population, there are many elderly population, the regional development is unbalanced, the total amount of medical resources is insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Once relaxed and prevent and control, the medical resources will face serious risk The physical health of pregnant women and other people will be threatened, and it will also have a serious impact on economic and social development. The people's supremacy and life first, curbing the epidemic as soon as possible is the truly respect for every life. Only when the epidemic is effectively controlled, the economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. It is necessary to accelerate the disposal of local aggregate epidemics, improve prevention and control measures in a timely manner, make every effort to prepare for the epidemic situation, and earnestly be responsible for defending the soil.  In the past two years, we have accumulated experience in the struggle with the COVID-19 virus. The emergency system, treatment system, public participation, and joint defense and joint control mechanism have formed a basic experience, to quickly improve. Although Omikon's mutant plant has a strong propagation, as long as it is discovered early, early reports, early isolation, early treatment, cutting off the transmission path, protecting the sensible people, and can still control the epidemic in time. Generally speaking, the earlier the epidemic discovered, the more clear the chain was spreading. If it is found late, especially when the scope of the source of the infected source and the infected person is affected and the crowds, it is necessary to appropriately expand the scope of management and control, strengthen the detection of nucleic acid, and strengthen the corresponding control measures. Now, my country's epidemic prevention and control has entered the fourth stage of comprehensive comprehensive prevention and control ""scientific and precise, dynamic ZERO-COVID"". At this stage, in addition to fast and accurate, we must also pay attention to comprehensiveness. It is necessary to take some comprehensive prevention and control measures, including the rapid blocking of the source of infectious sources, the rapid blocking of the transmission pathway, and the protection of susceptible people. The most resolute and decisive measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic society.  Racing with the virus is to race with time. The faster you run, the more you can grasp the initiative of war. Practice has proven that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. Our prevention and control policy can stand the test of historical testing. Our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.

The provincial epidemic is still in the tail sweeping stage, and the risks other than the isolation point and the seal control area have been basically controlled; the Beijing epidemic through regional nucleic acid screening and close inspection and control, the spread risk has been reduced ... It proves that the policies and policies determined by the Party Central Committee are completely correct, and the various prevention and control measures taken by the Party Central Committee are scientific and effective.  The normalization epidemic prevention and control is a difficult and heavy work that needs to be persisted for a long time. It must deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of resistance and struggle. From the outside, the global epidemic is still at high, and the virus is still mutating. The ultimate direction of the epidemic has great uncertainty, far before it can be relieved and rest. From the inside, China continues to face a large pressure input pressure, and the risk of local epidemic is still high.

It is an inevitable requirement for our party to put people's life safety and health first. The virus fighting with Omikon mutation strains is not advisable to ""lying flat"", and ""lying to win"" is impossible.

How to get out of this difficult period to test the wisdom of governing the country and governing politics in various countries requires cooperation in the international community to respond. However, in the world's largest economy in the United States, many strange talks have emerged. The problem of high inflation is becoming increasingly serious. Ordinary people complained that some people in the United States did not reflect on their responsibilities, but attempted to prevent and control the Chinese epidemic. While ""shaking the pot"" China, these people have not forgotten to sing the Chinese economy, and make noise to decompose to China. Everyone with a clear eye can clearly see that these errors are incredible, not only cannot solve the US economic problems, but also to help the international community work together to spend difficulties.  In March of this year, the inflation rate in the United States reached more than 40 years. The main source of this problem is that the United States has implemented an unprecedented multi -round large -scale loose fiscal and monetary policy. The policy of large and water -filled policies has led to surge in fiscal deficit and superb currency. Under the stimulus of multiple rounds of radical fiscal and monetary policy, the total demand of American society has rebounded, but the effective supply is insufficient, and the overall price level is raised. The U.S. government once held the ""temporary theory of inflation"", which was insufficient to predict the severity of the problem, which led to a fault. After the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the United States attracted allies on the implementation of Russia's implementation of restrictions, causing a huge impact on global energy, food, and industrial chain, which further exacerbated the pressure of American inflation. For political reasons, the current US government has continued the mistakes of the previous government to China, and continued to levy high tariffs on a large number of Chinese -American commodities, significantly pushing the cost of imported goods, but American consumers had to pay for the government's wrong policy. The United States has a high inflation and is not determined for a long time. It originated from its own policies. Where is the ""throwing pot"" China and the politicalization of economic issues can be solved?  China insists on dynamic Zero-Covid's unwavering. It is a scientific decision-making based on national conditions and reflects the concept of people's supremacy and life first. In fact, the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. China adheres to the dynamic Zero-Covid, efficiently coordinates the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development. It not only prevents the epidemic, but also stabilizes the economy. It is truly responsible for the world economy. Some politicians in the United States frequently attack the prevention and control measures of China's epidemic, trying to impose the so -called ""disrupting the global supply chain"" to China, which is upside down black and white, and once again exposed the distorted mentality of being treated in China.  Affected by multiple factors, the downward pressure on the Chinese economy has recently increased, but the international economic community generally believes that China's economic toughness, sufficient potential, wide range of rooms, and long -term good fundamentals have not changed. China is fully capable of defeating difficulties and challenges, realizing sustainable and healthy development, providing strong kinetic energy for the stabilization of the world economy, and providing broader market opportunities for countries. Georkiya, president of the International Monetary Fund, has recently emphasized that the Chinese government has sufficient policy space to deal with the downward pressure on the economy and be able to boost the Chinese economy. In the first quarter of this year, the total imports and exports of Chinese goods increased by 10.7%year -on -year, and the actual use of foreign capital increased by 25.6%year -on -year, showing China's positive contribution to the stable global industrial chain supply chain, and also reflecting the confidence of enterprises in various countries in China's economic development prospects. Some people in the United States sing down the Chinese economy, which cannot change the confidence of the international community's long -term development of the Chinese economy, and it cannot stop the general trend of strengthening opening up cooperation with China.  Against the background of difficult recovery of the world economy, the urgency of major global economies to strengthen macro policy coordination is more prominent. The United States is the largest economy in the world, and its monetary policy ""rapid turn"" will undoubtedly bring serious challenges to the stability of the world economy and financial stability. The majority of developing countries will be the first. The International Monetary Fund warned at the beginning of this year that the Fed's faster tightening monetary policy may cause capital outflow and currency depreciation of emerging economies, and the prospects of economic growth are even more uncertain. As the Fed recently announced its interest rate hikes and will reduce the balance sheet of nearly 9 trillion US dollars from June 1, international public opinion is concerned that ""this may bring another impact on the world economy and financial markets."" Facing the concerns and concerns of all parties, the United States should strengthen communication and coordination with all parties to reduce the negative spilling effect of its economic policies, rather than passing the contradiction, finding scapegoats, and adding new risks to the world economy.  The era of our lives is an era of deep integration of the interests of various countries. Any approach to neighbors and extreme favors will eventually fail. The great powers should show their responsibilities and effectively promote the recovery of the world economy and the global sustainable development. China maintains its strategic determination, insists on doing its own, insist on expanding its high levels of opening up, working together to build an open world economy, and maintaining the stable supply chain of the global industrial chain.

In today's world, who still regards the United States as a ""lighthouse of human rights"" and an example of imitation?  The US media reported recently that the COVID-19 outbreak has led to more than 200,000 American children who lost their parents or main caregivers and became the ""orphan"". These orphans are also facing risks such as drug abuse, school loss, and poverty. However, the US media pointed out that the disadvantaged group that most needed help has not been ""treated as a urgent issue."" The facts once again show that the United States, which often uses human rights as an excuse, is in the United States, which is pointed at other countries, and is owed more debt in respect and guarantee the human rights of the country.  The huge number of ""epidemic orphan"" is the result of the US government's test of ""failure"" in the face of the epidemic test. So far, the COVID-19 death case in the United States has approached 1 million cases, and many families are fragmented. According to statistics, every 12 orphans under the age of 18 in the United States have one ""epidemic orphan"" among the 12 orphans. The ""New York City"" electronic report survey shows that every 200 children in New York City have a ""epidemic orphan"". However, in the face of these sad numbers, the US government and federal judges are still in the ""mask order"", and new epidemic prevention measures are also unable to be in place due to the disputes between the parliamentary party. US government health officials pointed out that if funds are not in place, it will be difficult for the United States to keep up with the speed of virus evolution, and people's health, economy and mentality will be greatly threatened.  The miserable situation of ""orphan"" reflects the US government's indifference to the basic human rights of vulnerable groups. The American ""Atlantic Monthly"" reported that a report entitled ""The Forgotten Epidemic Orphan"" recently pointed out that losing their parents at an early age may be the darkest time in life experience. Related reports show that some medical staff are unattended after their deaths, and some single mothers are forced to flow on the street after their illness. The US government lacks targeted assistance measures and has caused widespread criticism. Lecite Kidman, a social epidemiologist in the State University of New York, pointed out that the US government has a slow action when facing the largest orphan incident of the century. And raising arrangement. Susan Hillis, the head of the Children's Research Team, is affected by COVID-19, believes that the psychological problem of ""epidemic orphan"" may be accompanied by life, and a large number of public resources are needed to treat psychological trauma. However, it is difficult for the US government to even have the minimum material guarantee, let alone take care of its psychological problems.  The ""epidemic orphan"" shows obvious racial differences, which has enlarged the problem of systemic racial discrimination in American society. American scholars have found that the population of ethnic minorities accounts for 39%of the total US population, but the ethnic minority ""epidemic orphan"" accounts for 65%. On average, every 753 white children have one to become ""epidemic orphan"", and this corresponds to the average of Latin American descent every 412 children have become ""epidemic orphans"", 310 African descent and 168 indigenous Indians. Laocann Lei, a senior researcher at the Brucks Society in the United States, pointed out that when systemic racism was not past in the United States, it continued to spread in society and penetrate all aspects of daily life.  Focusing on the suffering of the people, giving special care for disadvantaged groups is the responsibility of a country's government. However, just when the U.S. ""epidemic orphan"" caused widespread public attention from public opinion, the US government did not think about taking remedial measures to solve the problem of concern to the people of the country. The human rights situation in the country and region says that it is three, but it only missed the United States. The German ""Youth World Daily"" pointed out that the United States issued a report to judge the human rights status of other countries each year, but its own human rights situation has continued to deteriorate, and the ""dual moral standards run through the beginning and end of the report.""  Politizing human rights and dual standards, trying to transfer the dissatisfaction of the country's dissatisfaction with the government is a completely poor performance, which can not hide the fact that the human rights situation of the United States has deteriorated. The phenomenon of ""orphan"" is just a microcosm of the increasing US government's increasing human rights debt.

Everyone rolled up their sleeves, and they built a biological safety standard here without losing the traditional laboratory's gas film laboratory.  ""We named it the 'Great Wall' nucleic acid detection laboratory, that is, I want to be a city to win the battle against this epidemic."" Xia Xiaokai said.  From March 20th, ambulances and trains from various places have continued to send nucleic acid samples. Hundreds of employees and volunteers scrambled against time and tested for 24 hours. Although the air conditioner was installed, the temperature in the laboratory was still close to 30 degrees Celsius. In this environment, wearing a tight protective clothing was very sultry.  ""You must not make an error!"" Li Wei said that the test results were accurate and directly related to the overall situation of the health of the masses and the prevention and control of the epidemic, so they strictly reviewed each test result. The laboratory can detect 50,000 samples every day, and the cumulative detection volume has exceeded 10 million. Every day, you have to compare a lot of data on your computer every day. When you look at the flowers, you can wash your face with cold water. If you are too tired, go to the nearby simple shed to lie down for a while.

The Central Political Bureau meeting held on April 29 requested that ""efficient coordination of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development"" ""solidly stabilize the economy, strive to achieve the goal of economic and social development throughout the year, and maintain economic operation in a reasonable range."" In the next step, what measures will the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology promote the steady growth of the industrial economy? The reporter interviewed Xin Guobin, deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  Multi -strategies can open up the industrial chain supply chain, and the pace of re -production and re -production in key areas in key areas accelerates the pace  Reporter: What new challenges are facing the current industrial economy? In terms of ensuring the smooth and stable supply chain of the industrial chain, what are the work and information of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and what is the current progress?  Xin Guobin: In the first quarter, the added value of industrial industries above designated size increased by 6.5%year -on -year, which was 2.6 percentage points accelerated from the fourth quarter of 2021 to maintain the momentum of continuing to recover. However, since mid -late March, some new situations and problems have experienced the industrial economy, and new downward pressure has been faced. According to the analysis of the situation reflected in various places, the most prominent difficulty is that the external environment is severe and complicated, the unstable uncertainty increases, and the overlapping epidemic is more distributed, resulting in increasing the suspension of enterprises' suspension of production and poor logistics transportation. In addition, the price of large raw materials continued to fluctuate at a high level, increasing the cost of middle and lower reaches, and the pressure on the turnover of small and medium -sized enterprises' funds, which affected the stable operation of the industrial chain supply chain.  In the face of these difficulties, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology regarded the unblocked industrial chain supply chain as the primary task of the current work, and immediately established a ""whitelist"" system for the key industry chain supply chain supply chain enterprise, and quickly adopted a series of measures with relevant departments to make preservation and stability. Chain rejuvenation ""combination boxing"".  Strengthen multi -party collaboration. Print the work plan and send a front work group to key areas to do a good job of medical material guarantee and the promotion of corporate resumption of work.  Determine the focus of protection. Focusing on the four areas of anti -epidemic prevention and medical supplies, essential materials for residents, important materials for agricultural production, and key supplies of strategic emerging industries, establish a ""white list"" system for key enterprises. It has determined 1624 key enterprises in four batches and guided 17 provinces Establish a ""white list"" of key enterprises at the local level, coordinate and solve specific difficulties and problems reflected by key enterprises in a timely coordination, and ensure factor service guarantee.  Grasp the key industry chain to keep it well. A coordination platform for the supply chain coordination platform of key industrial chain supply chain of automobiles, integrated circuits, and medical supplies has been established, focusing on key areas such as the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, etc., one by one to promote the return of employees' return, logistics and transportation such as employees reflected by the industrial chain enterprises, and strive to ensure upstream and downstream enterprises. Coordinated production, with some chains and chain -with surfaces to ensure that the key industry chain is running smoothly.  Through the joint efforts of various regions and departments, preliminary results have been achieved, and the pace of re -production and recovery in key areas and key industries has accelerated. As of April 28, among Shanghai's first batch of 666 ""whiters"" enterprises, the re -work rate reached 86.8%, of which the re -work rate of the vehicle and parts of the component of the automobile manufacturing industry reached 77%. Integrated circuit design, manufacturing, and testing The re -work rate of related enterprises reached 91%. The 50 backbone enterprises monitored by Jilin Province reached 98%.  In the next step, we will work in three aspects: First, to ensure stable production of key enterprises. Promote the ""white list"" area of key enterprises in various places, and coordinate and refine the work guarantee work. The second is to ensure the stable operation of key industries. Give full play to the role of the industrial chain supply chain coordination platform, open up the card points, and concentrate the resource priority to ensure that integrated circuits, automobiles, equipment manufacturing, biomedical and other key industries and other industries have been resumed. The third is to ensure the smooth cycle of industries in key areas. Focus on key industrial agglomeration areas such as the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, strengthen cross -regional and cross -provincial coordination, adopt point -to -point, one -to -one, short and fast way, effectively solve practical problems, and promote regional coordinated work and re -production.  The industrial economy shows signs of stability, and the long -term good fundamentals will not change  Reporter: How do you think of the new situation and problems of the current industrial economy, and what measures will the next step to promote the steady growth of the industrial economy?  Xin Guobin: The epidemic should be defended, the economy must be stabilized, and the development is safe. With the joint efforts of all parties, since mid -April, the industrial economy has gradually shown signs of stability. Beginning the second week of April, industrial electricity consumption has narrowed for two consecutive weeks; the industrial agglomeration index of mobile phone signaling monitoring has also risen stable. In general, the current difficulties encountered by the industrial economy are short -term and temporary. We have a complete industrial category, a complete supporting system, a broad market space, and a strong leadership of the Party Central Committee. The long -term fundamentals of my country's industrial economy will not change.  In the next step, we will conscientiously implement the spirit of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, efficiently coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, strengthen confidence, and overcome difficulties, and focus on four aspects:  The first is to go all out to keep and keep the industry and stabilize the industrial chain. Implement the ""whitelist"" system for the key industry chain supply chain enterprises, on the basis of doing a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic, ensure stable production of key enterprises, strengthen cross -regional coordination, and strive to open up the blocking point of the industrial chain supply chain in some places Card point, accelerate the re -production and re -production of enterprises.  The second is to go all out to help the enterprise to relieve the rescue and help enterprises through difficulties. Promote the implementation of policies to help enterprises and enterprises, provide accurate services, and carry out special rectification of the ""three chaos"" issues involving enterprises. The three -pronged approach of policies, services, and the environment, coordinated efforts to help small and medium -sized enterprises stable and safe development.  The third is to go all out to expand domestic demand and deeply stimulate growth potential. Persist in grasping both ends and grab the investment. Accelerate the implementation of major projects and projects of the ""Fourteenth Five -Year Plan"" planning industry, support the implementation of major technological transformation of energy conservation and carbon reduction in key areas, and guide basic telecommunications companies to moderately deploy 5G base stations construction in advance. Grasp the expansion of consumption. Fully excavate car consumption, information consumption, green consumption potential, organize a new round of new energy vehicles to go to the countryside, start a pilot of comprehensive electricized cities in the public domain, cultivate information consumption demonstration cities and demonstration projects, accelerate 5G technology and energy, education, etc. Vertical industry integration application.  The fourth is to go all out to stabilize expectations and boost the confidence of market players. On the one hand, strengthening coordination and coordination, promoting the promotion of policies to better implement, and make the majority of enterprises a sense of gain. On the other hand, do a good job of policy reserves, formulate and improve the plan for response plans for new challenges that may occur, and promptly introduce strong measures in a timely manner.  Persist in policies and services in both hands to further help small and medium -sized enterprises to relieve difficulties  Reporter: What are the work and information of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Hui Enterprise's bailout and how to continue to help SMEs in the next step?  Xin Guobin: We adhere to policies to benefit enterprises, serve enterprises, and environmental enterprises, and implement a package of measures to help small and medium -sized enterprises. The first is to grasp policy supply. Since the beginning of this year, the national level has introduced various types of policies such as tax cuts, tanks and expansion, financing promotion, and unblocking logistics. The second is to grasp service to help companies. Improve the service system of SMEs, gather and drive various high -quality resource services SMEs, and guide financial institutions to increase their support for SMEs. The third is to grasp the business environment. Organize the special rectification of the ""three chaos"" issues involved in enterprises, conduct in -depth work to prevent and resolve the accounts for minor and medium -sized enterprises, and strive to reduce the burden on small and medium -sized enterprises.  All localities have also taken strong measures in accordance with their own reality. For example, in terms of unblocked logistics, guide the establishment of material transportation connection areas in the industrial park and the establishment of a ""whitelist"" system for truck drivers; in terms of supporting enterprises to resume work, set up special classes to solve the problem of production factor protection of enterprises and carry out ""big visits"" In -depth first -line helping enterprises to relieve difficulties; in terms of reducing the operating costs of the enterprise, relevant enterprise employees are incorporated into the free nucleic acid testing population and the cost of electricity for enterprises is reduced. A series of innovative measures will effectively alleviate the impact of the epidemic on SMEs.  In the next step, we will actively work together with various regions and relevant departments to continue to grasp policies and services to further help SMEs to relieve difficulties.  On the one hand, the implementation of policies has been implemented. Improve policy services digital platforms, organize public service platforms at all levels to enter enterprises, parks, and clusters, and carry out policy interpretation and publicity work. Organize the implementation of special inspections to reduce the burden on enterprises and promote the development of SMEs, solve the problem of blocking points, and ensure that the implementation of various “reduction, exemption, and relief” to help enterprises and enterprises have been implemented.  On the other hand, focus on providing precise services. Organize the service month activities of SMEs, focus on short -board weaknesses in the entrepreneurial innovation, digital transformation, management improvement, and market development of small and medium -sized enterprises to help small and medium -sized enterprises solve the specific difficulties and problems encountered in production and operation and development. Quality, strive to provide small and medium -sized enterprises with services that can be found, affordable, and secure, and further enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises.",industrial chain; white list; key industry; supply chain; epidemic prevention and control; medical supplies; logistics transportation; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; Combination Boxing;

The main macro indicators remained in a reasonable range, and the national economy continued to resume the development trend. Under the multiple tests of the international environment more complicated and severe and the frequent domestic epidemic conditions, the Chinese economy achieved ""opening the door stable"" in the first quarter. It can be said that it is extremely difficult and valuable. The superb wisdom of the giant wheel breaking waves fully shows the strong toughness and vitality of my country's economy, with the distinctive characteristics of ""stability"" and ""entering"".

Under the condition of uncertainty of the global economy, macro stability has become scarce resources. The wind knows the grass, and the fire seeks the real gold. Practice fully shows that despite profound and complicated changes in the international and domestic situation, my country's economy is stable and good, and the fundamental fundamentals have not changed for a long time. The basic characteristics have not changed, and the advantages and conditions of my country's development have not changed. Shi and Shi are on our side. This is where we are for power and confidence, and our determination and confidence.  Those who inspect the potential, and those who control the potential win.

At the press conference of the National New Office held on April 29, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, said Essence  Since the end of February this year, in the face of the popularity of Omikon's mutation, my country's epidemic has a large, wide -faced, and frequent characteristics, and severe tests for preventing and controlling work. The conference introduced the relevant situation of the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" to do a good job in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and answered questions from reporters on hot questions.  National COVID-19 outbreaks are fluctuating and declined  ""At present, Jilin and other gathered epidemics have been effectively controlled. Shanghai Zero-Covid's tackling battle has been effective, and the national epidemic is in volatility."" Li Bin said that my country has always adhered to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". In the first time, the forces such as tuning, flow, transfer, transfer, isolation, and treatment are used to maximize the spread of the epidemic spread.  Li Bin said that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not an absolute ""zero infection"". my country has accumulated a set of effective prevention and control measures in the rich prevention and control practice. The potential prevention and control measures are continuously optimized and upgraded.  In response to whether the coexistence strategy can be implemented in some places, and implementing the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" problem in other places, Li Bin responded that the prevention and control of the epidemic is a overall battle. We must strengthen the awareness of the overall situation and adhere to a game of chess across the country. Ground control can provide a solid guarantee for the lives and health of the people, and create favorable conditions for normal production and life.  Li Bin said that on the premise of adhering to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", encouraging places to explore and summarize some good experiences and practices in accordance with the local epidemic situation and characteristics, further improve the scientific and precise level of epidemic prevention and control, and work hard to use it. The minimum cost achieves the maximum prevention and control effect.  To fight against Omikon, we must really achieve the ""four morning""  ""Although the Omikon variants have the characteristics of strong communication, strong hiddenness, asymptomatic infection, etc., it does not mean that it cannot be done 'four early' -early discovery, early report, early isolation and early treatment."" Liang Wannian, the leader of the Expert Group of the State Health and Health Commission's epidemic response work leading group, said that the joint detection strategy of nucleic acid+antigen self -testing is now advocated. Generally speaking, the sooner the epidemic discovered, the more clear the chain was spread.  Liang Wannian said that the ""four morning"" must be guaranteed by a series of concepts, abilities and mechanisms. When dealing with the epidemic, all localities must be prepared accordingly, including monitoring capabilities, discovery reports, and rapid response capabilities. If it is found late, especially when the scope of the source of the infected source and the infected person is affected and the crowds, it is necessary to appropriately expand the scope of management and control, strengthen the detection of nucleic acid, and strengthen the corresponding control measures.  Liang Wannian believes that my country has the technology and means of ""four early"", such as nucleic acid detection technology and antigen self -testing technology that has been widely promoted. In addition, there is a complete monitoring system, and the monitoring capabilities are further strengthening. For more than two years, he has accumulated experience in the struggle with the COVID-19 virus. The emergency system, treatment system, public participation, and joint defense and joint control mechanism have formed a basic experience, which is to quickly improve. As long as we use these well, we can definitely implement the ""four morning"" and defeat the COVID-19 epidemic at the minimum cost.  Liang Wannian said that my country is a large population, the regional development is unbalanced, the medical resources are generally insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Adopting the so -called ""lying"" strategy coexisting with the virus, medical resources will face the risk of serious crowding. The physical health of a large number of patients with basic diseases, elderly people, children, pregnant women and other people will be threatened, and economic and social development will also be. It will cause serious impact. In this case, we must adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy.  Establish a ""yellow code"" hospital to ensure normal medical services  Liang Wannian said that when calculating the cost and income of the COVID-19 epidemic, the overall account, overall account, and dynamic account settlement should be calculated. The ultimate goal of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to maximize the protection of people's lives and health, and to maximize the protection of economic and social development and normal production and life.  ""The"" dynamic Zero-Covid 'general policy and a series of anti-epidemic measures adopted by our country are equivalent to purchasing an insurance for more than 1.4 billion people to respond to uncertain factors such as epidemic changes. . ""Liang Wannian said.  In terms of guaranteeing normal medical services, Li Bin said that the National Health and Health Commission deployment requires the establishment of a ""yellow code"" hospital in various places to open a ""cloud clinic"". The emergency, rescue room, operating room, and ward buffer area, medical staff strictly implemented the first consultation system and emergency and severe severe rescue system, do a good job in personal protection, and timely and effective treatment, do not refuse for any reason, delay treatment. At the same time, it is necessary to meet the needs of special groups, improve medical security in the epidemic area, and coordinate the prevention and control of epidemic situations within the medical institution.  During the full effort to ensure the medical needs of the people's normal treatment during the epidemic situation, to ensure the supply of people's living materials during the epidemic, Lei Zhenglong, the head of the National Health and Health Commission's CDC, said that according to the changes in the situation of the epidemic situation and prevention and control work The actual needs, the prevention and control policies and measures are also constantly adjusted and improved to better coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development.  Greater cities brought inspiration to the covid-19 epidemic  Li Bin said that the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in my country is divided into four stages: the first stage, the emergency surrounding stage of the emergency epidemic. It took about three months to achieve the decisive results of the Wuhan Defense War and the Battle of Hubei. In the second stage, the exploration stage of normalization prevention and control. The centered on nucleic acid testing is used to expand prevention, and the epidemic is controlled with 2-3 incubation periods. In the third stage, the full chain is precisely prevent and control, and the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" stage. Based on the foundation of grasping the small and grasping early, make full use of the ""golden 24 hours"" after the epidemic, and strive to control the epidemic around a period of incubation. At present, my country has entered the fourth stage of comprehensive comprehensive prevention and control ""scientific and precise, dynamic Zero-Covid"".  What are the inspirations for the prevention and control of large cities? Liang Wannian said that Beijing and Shanghai are both large cities. The rapid spread of Omikon's mutant strains is a test of urban governance system and governance capabilities.  The first is to optimize and improve the past to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The general one is to rush quickly and run with the virus in time.  The second is to establish confidence. The practice of some cities proves that taking effective strategies and players can control the spread of the epidemic and realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  Third, in front of Omikon's mutant strains, the most vulnerable crowd is the elderly and basic diseases. The most effective way to protect is vaccination. The proportion of elderly population in Beijing and Shanghai is higher than the national average, strengthen the vaccination of the elderly, and effectively enhance the vaccination rate of vaccination, including strengthening needles, which is an effective means to protect the safety of the elderly and physical health.  The fourth is that the anti -attack epidemic is a systematic engineering, and a strong joint force needs to be formed. The anti -epidemic in Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities should be mobilized by the whole society, and the concept of system engineering should be implemented with the responsibility of the Quartet.",Epidemic prevention and control; total policy; nucleic acid test;

This slightly staggered but firm step, had drumped countless people.  From the president of Wuhan Jinyin Tan Hospital to the deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Health and Health Committee, his identity changed. What is unchanged is Zhang Dingyu's busy figure and dedicated spirit. In the past two years, he has conducted in -depth investigations to promote the construction of medical institutions' service capabilities, the development of traditional Chinese medicine, and the prevention and control of the epidemic, and work hard to protect the lives of the people.  After graduating from Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1986, Zhang Dingyu worked in clinical first -line clinical first -line in Wuhan Fourth Hospital and Wuhan Pu'ai Hospital. For more than 30 years, he has repeatedly asked the ""battlefield"" many times -leading the third medical team in Hubei Province to the Wenchuan disaster area to rescue the wounded, and to the Chinese medical team to Algeria, Pakistan and other countries to carry out international medical assistance, save the disaster area and warfire. s life.  In 2013, Zhang Dingyu was transferred to the president of Jin Yintan Hospital in Wuhan. He took the lead in introducing advanced equipment such as high -flow oxygen absorption devices, ECMO (artificial membrane lung), etc., and also led the hospital to successfully identify the eligibility of the drug clinical trial institution and conduct drug clinical trials. In 2018, it also established a post -doctoral mobile station with the Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to carry out clinical and scientific research cooperation, laying a solid foundation for the hospital's future emergencies.  More than two years ago, near the Lunar New Year, Wuhan Jinshan Tan Hospital, located in the northwest of Wuhan City, has successively treated some unknown causes of pneumonia. Zhang Dingyu, then the dean of Jin Yintan Hospital, Wuhan City, immediately arranged for patients with alveolar irrigation and samples to win the time for later locking the COVID-19 virus.  Faced with the aggressive epidemic, Zhang Dingyu urgently arranged for the hospital to purchase ventilator, guardians, infusion pumps and other equipment, continuously retired from new ward and ward, and reserved beds for continuous increased patients. On the eve of the Spring Festival, all 21 ward areas of Jinyantan Hospital were renovated, disinfected, and arranged, and they were put into use.  ""I am a doctor, a member of the party, and the dean of the medical treatment of public health in Hubei Province and Wuhan City. At a critical moment, I can't shrink back."" Zhang Dingyu said. In the face of more and more patients and the increasingly stretched medical staff, Zhang Dingyu was sleepy, taking the hospital as the home, from the ward reconstruction, the management of the hospital, to the specific medication and treatment of patients, he had a detailed arrangement and participation.  Just when Zhang Dingyu went all out to race with the virus, the bad news came: his wife, a nurse at the fourth hospital of Wuhan City, was unfortunately infected. Although the husband and wife were only more than 10 kilometers apart, Zhang Dingyu, who was lacking in the avatar, did not squeeze out the time until late at night on the third day, and then returned to work. After learning that his wife had improved, the stone in his heart fell to the ground.  One night, Zhang Dingyu went to the intensive ward. A 60 -year -old blind patient, grabbed his arm and asked, ""Are you Dean Zhang?""  ""How do you know it is me?"" Zhang Dingyu was surprised.  ""Your footsteps are different from everyone,"" the old man said.  After the epidemic, Zhang Dingyu continued to work at a high load, and walking more and more strenuous. In order to dispel everyone’s doubts, at a meeting of the hospital, he disclosed the fact that he suffered from gradient: ""I don't have much time, I must run faster to get back with you, grab it from the virus's hand to grab it back from the virus. More patients! Please everyone! ""  Driven by Zhang Dingyu, who was the first soldier, the cadres and staff of the hospital rushed to the front line of resistance.

US media reports pointed out that behind this amazing number is the tragedy of countless families, and the ""epidemic orphan"" of about 200,000 to lose their parents or the main caregivers, the U.S. government helps these orphans.  In July last year, a black couple Martin and Trina, a black couple in Savana, Georgia, died of COVID-19 in a few hours, leaving two children in their ten-year-old. ""No one knows how to accept the pain of losing parents. Lost two relatives on the same day, which is too heavy."" According to the two children's cousin Kolnelis, in the school where the two children are located, they also Dozens of students' parents died of COVID-19. Corinelis said: ""The government must realize that many children are in this situation. They have lost their parents in the epidemic, and they need to be economically supported by economic and mental health.""  This is not a case. According to the US ""Atlantic Monthly"" recently reported, about 200,000 American children lived in the pain of losing their parents due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The article pointed out that even after two years of the epidemic, the number of people who became orphans became so amazing. Among the orphans under the age of 18, every 12 people loses the guardian because of the epidemic; in the United States, there are two children in each public school who lose one guardian due to the epidemic.

Researchers have also found that the ""epidemic orphan"" problem in vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities is even more serious. These orphans are incompetent come from low -income and non -white families. They have faced many difficulties in their lives, and they have worsened the caregivers. Studies from the US Centers for Disease Control have pointed out that there are obvious racial differences in the COVID-19 epidemic death case, and minority children account for 65%of the ""orphan"".  ""The U.S. Epidemic Orphan"" is being ignored. ""The article"" Atlantic Monthly ""pointed out that losing parents at a young age may be the darkest time in life experience. The risk of orphan abuse of drugs, dropping out and falling into poverty has increased. The possibility of dying from suicide is almost twice orphans, and they may suffer from all kinds of problems.  Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Harvard University, said that the epidemic caused many children to suddenly lose dependence, which has become a potential serious social problem. Losing parents or caregivers in childhood is a major trauma. Susan Hillis, a senior technical consultant at the US Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Childhood, may have a profound long -term impact on children's health and well -being.

Faced with the neglected group of ""orphan"", the government's inadequate assistance continued to trigger criticism from American society. Many experts point out that although there are some assistance measures in various places, they lack a strong national strategy. The U.S. government recently issued a memorandum of memo including helping people and other contents in the epidemic, but the relevant person in charge, Mary Wall, said that there will be no dedicated teams in related actions. funds. Wall said that if new funds are required to encounter problems, because the US Congress is difficult to reach an agreement in the most basic anti -epidemic measures such as treatment, testing, vaccine, etc.  The article ""Atlantic Monthly"" quoted experts from the expert: ""'Opone orphan' needs to be helped in time.

At present -Covid has achieved important stages of results, and some positive changes are emerging. This is a full confirmation of the scientific and effectiveness of dynamic Zero-Covid, and it is also a full confirmation of our conditions and capable of achieving dynamic Zero-Covid.  To measure the severity of virus popularity, we must comprehensively consider the communication power and the severe illness and death. From the perspective of propagation, Omikon's spread is much greater than the flu and the previous COVID-19 virus strains. In the absence of any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. From the perspective of disease mortality, the average mortality rate of the global influenza is 0.1%, and the average disease mortality rate of Omikon's mutant strains is about 0.75%, which is 7 to 8 times the flu. More than 10%is nearly a hundred times the normal flu. This warns us that Omikon is by no means the so -called ""large flu"", and its harm must not be underestimated.  To curb the epidemic as soon as possible is the true respect for every life, and insisting that the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is essentially adhering to the people's supremacy and life supremacy. Judging from the actual situation in my country, the number of elderly population in my country is huge, coupled with a considerable number of children and people who cannot vaccine with contraindications, the vaccination rate has not yet formed a barrier to resist to severe and death. Once relaxed the epidemic prevention and control and letting the virus spread, it is bound to cause a large number of people to be infected in the short term, and there will be a large number of severe cases and death cases, causing medical resources to be crowded, so that normal medical service needs will not be resolved. Large -scale infection. Once such a vicious circle is formed, it will be a huge disaster. In this regard, adhering to the dynamic Zero-Covid, is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control of more than 1.4 billion people who must be more than 1.4 billion.  To deal with infectious diseases, we need to consider the severity of the virus, the handling capacity of the medical system, and the social public health intervention measures. Some of the infectious diseases we have encountered in the past, such as tuberculosis, are also very harmful, but through strengthening the construction of the medical system, we can effectively block its spread. In comparison, the COVID-19 virus, especially Omikon, has a fast transmission, strong hidden, short incubation period, and a large number of infections. In addition, the virus is still mutating. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the social public health intervention measures, and to make efforts for the three links: the source of infection, the transmission pathway, and the susceptible population. Only in this way can we cut off the way of spreading the epidemic as soon as possible, so that the epidemic is not allowed to cause continuous community transmission and a scale rebound. It can be said that adhering to the dynamic Zero-Covid is not only an inevitable requirement of adhering to the people's supremacy and life first, but also a powerful manifestation of respect for science and respect.  Anti -fighting epidemic is a systematic project. It is necessary to consider three aspects at the same time: one is to control the epidemic situation, the other is to ensure the normal life of the people, and the third is to ensure that the economic and social operations are necessary. The three are indispensable. The prevention and control of the epidemic and normal production and life, and the development of economic and social development are by no means a ""single -choice question"". It is by no means opposite, but a complementary, dialectical and unified relationship. Tompassing the guarantee of the supply, opening the ""last 100 meters"" to the distribution of materials, and solving specific problems for the masses. This is also the internal requirements of the people's supreme and life first. There should be a meaning in China.  The first consideration of determining the best plan for anti -fighting epidemic is to maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health to the greatest extent. In the dynamic Zero-Covid, ""dynamic"" is to discover and extinguish together, and keep the bottom line that does not have the scale of the epidemic. COVID, ""Epidemic"" Zero-Covid, ""Zero-Covid"" at this stage is for ""epidemic"". Practice has repeatedly proved that dynamic Zero-Covid is the best choice based on my country's current epidemic situation. It is the best choice to adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, and it is the key to curbing the spread of epidemic spread as soon as possible. Adhere to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"" general policy of not hesitation and shake, holding confidence in winning, and effectively implementing various measures in place. Guard the lives of the people's lives and health.",The people's supremacy; epidemic prevention and control;

In this round of epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai adheres to the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine and uses Chinese and Western medicines, and gives full play to the unique advantages of Chinese medicine in fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic.  What is the effect of traditional Chinese medicine? How to better treat elderly infection and improve the ability of patients with severe and critical illnesses? The reporter interviewed Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.  The effect is good for non -symptoms and mild infections after the intervention of traditional Chinese medicine  ""From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, the core disease of Omikon's mutant strain and the pathogenesis have not changed significantly compared with the previous strains, and still belong to the category of the disease of Chinese medicine."" The cause of the plant is to feel the epidemic. The number of asymptomatic infections and the high proportion are the obvious characteristics of the Shanghai this round of epidemic. On the one hand, it is related to the characteristics of Omikon's mutant strains. Its toxicity is relatively weakened and the clinical symptoms are relatively mild; on the other hand, it is related to timely screening in my country and early infected with infected people and extensive vaccination COVID-19 virus vaccines. Essence  ""For asymptomatic infections, Western medicine believes that there is no symptoms, and Chinese medicine believes that there is evidence."" Zhang Boli analyzed, such as some asymptomatic infected people, may have the symptoms of burnout, greasy tongue coating, and abdominal bloating. According to the ""New Coronatte Pneumonic Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Trial Ninth Edition)"", use ""three -party and three medicines"", plus Shanghai's proposed protocol medicine for treatment. From the perspective of the preliminary use, after using traditional Chinese medicine intervention in the asymptomatic and mild infection, it shows good effects in preventing the progress of the disease and the acceleration of the test results of nucleic acid testing.  Try to block the development of the elderly infected.  ""At present, 30 % of the elderly over 60 years old in hospitalization cases. Most elderly people have basic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, advanced tumors, etc."" Zhang Boli said, basic diseases and COVID-19 plus plus Together, it will lead to serious illness, and it is easy to turn into severe and critical illnesses. It needs to pay special attention.  ""The primary principle of treating elderly infected people is 'new and old diseases'."" Zhang Boli believes that it is not difficult to simply treat COVID-19, but it is mixed with unstable basic diseases, which is more difficult to treat. Therefore, while treating COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the treatment of basic diseases.  ""The second principle is to‘ righteousness and dispel evil ’.” Zhang Boli analyzed that the elderly often had basic disease evidence such as insufficient qi, viscera deficiency, and poor qi and blood. After infection with the COVID-19 virus, it was easy to increase quickly, and it was necessary to focus on treatment. During treatment, we must pay attention to ""righteousness"", protect ""righteous qi"", and use methods such as qi and promoting blood, nourishing qi and nourishing yin; focusing on ""clearing"" and ""passing"". Waiting for prescriptions.  ""The third principle is to treat the passport forward, symptoms, and cut off the disease."" Zhang Boli believes that the infected person is a process from non -symptoms to symptoms, and it is necessary to intervene early. For example, in clinical practice, although some elderly infected people seem to be ordinary, when the fever continues, unclear consciousness, phlegm sticky cough, and lungs without absorption, time must be treated.  Improve the ability of patients with critical illness and critical illness  At present, the number of cases of severe and critical illnesses in Shanghai has begun to increase, and the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine has also increased.  Zhang Boli introduced that Shanghai Organization has rich experience in infectious diseases. Shanghai famous Chinese medicine medicine and Qihuang scholars, etc., together with the national traditional Chinese medicine expert group to form a multi -disciplinary Chinese medicine expert group. , Comprehensively participate in the municipal -level Chinese and western medical experts joint inspection and consultation.  ""The treatment of patients with severe illnesses and critical illness is to emphasize multi -disciplinary cooperation."" Zhang Boli believes that the disciplines of severe medical sciences, respiratory, nutrition support, care, and traditional Chinese medicine must play their own advantages and collective efforts. Traditional Chinese and Western medicine combined, Chinese medicine, China Western medicines are used together to control the disease, reverse the disease, and reduce the disease.  Zhang Boli analyzes that according to factors such as basic diseases, the most dangerous factors for each case adopt the method of dialectical and targeted treatment strategies for each case. Specifically is a ""early"", a ""quasi"". Early discovery, early warning, early research, early judgment, early intervention; targeted precision treatment, ""one person, one policy, one person, one side, one party one party"". In terms of specific treatment, it is necessary to ""fast"", sometimes ""stable"", patiently observe the changes in symptoms, and stability is not worse. Sometimes it must be ""supported"".

How to look at the current epidemic prevention strategy? How to do precision prevention and control? The reporter interviewed Liang Wannian, the leader of the Expert Group of the State Health and Health Commission's epidemic response work.  Adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" and maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health  Since March, my country's epidemic has increased significantly, and the number of infections has increased rapidly. Some people have proposed that after the infection of Omircong strains, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infection is very high. Is the current epidemic prevention of ""big movement""?  ""It can be said certain that the current epidemic prevention and control is not a 'great movement."" Liang Wannian said that the severity of a virus must be comprehensively considered and the severe illness and death caused by the dissemination. Omikon's spread is much greater than the flu and the previous COVID-19 virus strains. In the absence of any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. From the perspective of disease mortality, the average mortality rate of the global influenza is 0.1%. Real world data shows that the average disease mortality rate of Omikon's mutant strains is about 0.75%, which is 7 to 8 times the flu. The mortality rate of the elderly people is more than 10%, which is nearly a hundred times that of ordinary flu.  Liang Wannian said that from the actual situation in China, the population of the elderly is huge, and the fragile and easy sense of children such as children. Once the epidemic is relaxed, a large number of people will be infected in the short term. People are panicked, causing medical resources to be crowded, and normal medical service needs cannot be resolved, forming a vicious circle.  Liang Wannian said that my country has always adhered to the concept of ""people's supremacy, life first"", and has conditions and ability to adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". The connotation of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is to effectively identify and manage the source of infection, effectively cut off the transmission channels, and find that together and extinguish it together, prevent the epidemic from disadvantaging the spread of community and a scale. healthy.  Epidemic prevention is a systematic project.  The essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast and accurate. ""Faced with the characteristics of fast transmission, concealment, and short latent period of Omir Rong's mutant strains. The key to preventing and controlling epidemic is to be fast."" Liang Wannian said, how to do it faster? In fact, we are required to maintain a high degree of vigilance and strengthen the ability to respond to the public health system.  Once the epidemic is found, the enclosure should be quickly implemented and the epidemic dissemination should be controlled to the minimum range. To do this, not only should you quickly discover cases and transfer to treatment, but also preparations for beds, manpower, guarantee supplies, etc. are also fast, and running at faster speeds and viruses. Secondly, it is necessary to achieve precision, through nucleic acid detection and antigen self -test, effectively and quickly lock the infection, and implement accurate management.  During the prevention and control of the epidemic, some people's production and life was affected, and problems such as insufficient living materials were in place and poor daily medical channels. In this regard, Liang Wannian said that it is necessary to take measures to correct them in a timely manner, and to establish reforms. For example, it is necessary to effectively protect the needs of the masses to see a doctor for medical treatment, and epidemic prevention measures must also be more humane and temperature.  ""Epidemic prevention is a systematic project."" Liang Wannian said that the prevention and control of the epidemic is not only a matter for the government, but also a matter of the whole society and individuals. It involves all aspects. The relationship between.  Further make good preparations in all aspects  ""It has not yet reached the stage of preventing and controlling prevention and control."" Liang Wannian emphasized that the prevention and control measures of the epidemic are based on the scientific understanding of the virus, the characteristics of the epidemic, the scope of the epidemic situation, and the resistance we have.  Liang Wannian said that practice has proved that vaccination is very effective for preventing severe illnesses and death. At present, the vaccination rate of the elderly and children is not high enough, and it is necessary to further increase the vaccination rate of fragile people such as the elderly. Secondly, Omikon's mutant strains are not the last mutant strains, which is the consensus of the international scientific community. It is necessary to continue to pay attention to and study the spread of mutation plants, the pathogenesis, etc. in order to effectively adjust the epidemic prevention measures.  At present, Omikon may still be the main popular strains we are facing. In response to the characteristics of Omikon, local governments must be prepared, including medical resources such as nucleic acid detection capabilities, beds such as beds, human resources, emergency management mechanisms, as well as living materials supply and community management under the prevention and control of the epidemic.  ""Unified thoughts, firm confidence, and fully prepared, we must be able to defeat the covid-19 epidemic."" Liang Wannian said.",Epidemic prevention and control;

On April 21, President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the Boao Asia Forum in the 2022 Annual Meeting in a video. Based on the moment and in the long run, President Xi Jinping puts forward four claims for the changes of the world, the changes of the times, and the changes of history for all human beings. Among them, ""we must jointly protect human life and health together"" to deepen cooperation between countries and cooperate with each other, improve global public health governance, and jointly promote the direction of the guidance of the construction of human health and health community.  Strengthen mutual support  Formation of anti -epidemic  At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is still repeatedly delayed globally, and the uneven distribution of vaccines, and the continuous mutation of the virus, which greatly hinders the pace of the global epidemic prevention and control, and shadow the world economic recovery. Human beings have completely defeated the Covid-19 epidemic.  This is a century test and a world test. Faced with the test of this fate of human beings, where should countries go?  In the general trend of the pulse era, President Xi Jinping clarified China's claim- ""Rushing out of the fog towards light, the most powerful force is the same force, the most effective way is to help with sincerity."" Governance and form a strong international joint force to cope with the epidemic. ""  The epidemic reminds us that there are still shortcomings and loopholes in the global health governance system, and it is imminent to strengthen the construction of global public health governance capabilities. It is necessary to strengthen and play the role of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, improve the global disease prevention and control system, and better prevent and cope with the future epidemic. We must adhere to the co -discussion and sharing, fully listen to the opinions of developing countries, and better reflect the reasonable demands of developing countries. It is necessary to improve monitoring and early warning and emergency response capabilities, major epidemic treatment capabilities, emergency material reserves and guarantee capabilities, cracking down on false information capabilities, and support capabilities to developing countries.  The epidemic reminds us that in the rough waves of the global crisis, countries ride on a large ship of fate and Communist Party. President Xi Jinping pointed out many times that the emergencies similar to the COVID-19 epidemic will never be the last time. If you want to solve the difficulties, you must carry out global actions, global response, and global cooperation. The international community adheres to the concept of the community of human destiny, and adheres to the road of multilateralism and the combination of groups in order to deal with various global issues and build a beautiful earth home.  ""Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping's vision and strong and powerful, China is accelerating the development of all aspects and conveying a signal of lasting peace and stability and common prosperity to the world."" At the annual meeting of the Boao Asia Forum, Nepal President Bandari China actively provides anti -epidemic support to all parties. ""In today's era, countries must unite and cooperate and support each other in order to properly cope with global challenges and solve global problems.""  ""At the moment when the global economy and security facing multiple challenges, President Xi Jinping pointed out the direction for the rushing out of the fog towards all countries."" Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the American Institute of International Institute of International Institute of International Issues, believes that China has explained again through the platform of the Boao Forum for Asia. The relationship between resistance and development, ""Only by strengthening cooperation, forming consensus, and cohesion can we obtain a powerful momentum that supports the recovery of Asia and the global economic recovery.""  Fairly allocated vaccine  Slow  Vaccine is a powerful weapon to defeat the epidemic and restore the economy. President Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to adhere to the attributes of vaccines as a global public product and ensure the accessability and burden of vaccine in developing countries.  At the annual meeting of this forum, the relevant parties further summarized global anti -epidemic experience, promoted vaccine cooperation, and built a global ""immune barrier"". On the sub -forum with the theme of ""Reducing 'Immune Glutology"" and sharing health and well -being, international organization representatives and public health experts generally expressed concerns about the current global vaccine distribution. People have not been vaccinated, and the data in Africa is as high as 83%; among the low-income countries, only less than half of the population vaccines, and more than 80%of the developed countries have vaccinated ... COVID-19 vaccine countries are prepared Ted Chai Ban, the global chief coordinator of the delivery work, emphasized that countries should be committed to strengthening cooperation and allowing more people to vaccinate. ""China has played a very important role in vaccine delivery and fundraising Information and technical support "".  The fairness of global vaccines is the common expectations of the people of the world, and it is also an important issue for China to actively promote international anti -epidemic cooperation. In response to the increasingly prominent problem of unbalanced vaccination in the world, President Xi Jinping has clearly stated that it is necessary to abandon the ""vaccine nationalism"" and solve the problem of vaccine capacity and distribution.  Adhering to the concept of the community of human health and health, China advocates and actively practiced the global vaccine cooperation operation. The earliest promised to use the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public product. The earliest support for vaccine intellectual property exemption, and the earliest vaccine production cooperation with developing countries. At present, China has successively transferred technologies to more than 20 countries and cooperated with vaccines, and a 1 billion dose of COVID-19 vaccine has been formed overseas. These actions are real, strongly leading international anti -epidemic cooperation, and contributing Chinese power to any country ""falling behind"" and to crack ""distribution of deficit"".  In February this year, relying on Chinese vaccines in localized production projects in Egypt, China -Egypt jointly assisted 500,000 doses of vaccines to Gaza. Mohammed Hassonny, deputy minister of Health of the Egyptian Ministry of Health, proudly stated that Egypt China ""created an example of anti -epidemic cooperation"" and ""China actively provides vaccine assistance to other countries. The rate can reach 70%. ""  ""We need to promote the equality of vaccination and protect the most vulnerable crowd under the epidemic. This is an important issue facing the world. In this regard, China has given a lot of support and made great contributions."" The Red Cross and Red New The Secretary -General of the Month of the Monthly Confederation, Jobaguki, emphasized.  Persist in life first  Demonstrate China's responsibility  ""Thank you very much for China for help"", ""China is a friendly neighborhood"", ""Thank you sincerely for China"" ... At this annual meeting of this forum, ""thanks"" became a high -frequency word for the representatives of the meeting. During his speech, the leaders of many countries and the heads of international organizations personally promoted President Xi Jinping to express their respect for international cooperation against immunity, and appreciated China's great efforts to promote the construction of human health community.  The safety of people's lives and health is the prerequisite for human development and progress. From adhering to the concept of people's supremacy and life first, to global development initiative to include resistance and vaccines in the eight key cooperation areas, the pace of united parties in unity in cooperation with against the disease and overwhelming time has never stopped. In the complicated international situation, China is responsible and provides comprehensive support for developing countries.  President Xi Jinping pointed out that China has provided more than 2.1 billion vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Regardless of whether it is vaccine or overseas vaccine, China must believe in and act. China will continue to assist 600 million doses and 150 million doses of vaccines in Africa and ASEAN, respectively, and make positive efforts to bridge the ""immune gap"".  At present, more than 60 countries around the world have mainly used Chinese vaccines to deal with epidemic conditions. Among the top 10 countries with the total global vaccination and the top 10 per capita vaccination volume, half of the Chinese vaccine is the main force. Developing countries are the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese vaccines. The first batch of vaccines received by many developing countries are from China, and most of the vaccines obtained so far are also from China. At the same time, China and more than 10 countries and international and regional organizations sharing epidemic prevention and control and diagnosis and treatment plans, submitted to the World Health Organization for the ""Research Report on the COVID-19 Evidence-based Evolution Evaluation Research"" to the World Health Organization; Expert group; provided about 372 billion masks, more than 4.2 billion protective clothing, 8.4 billion test agents ...  Chen Fengfuzhen, Director of Honor of the World Health Organization and Chairman of the Global Health Forum of the Boao Forum, said that China is doing everything they can do, not only protecting its own citizens, but also as much as possible to contribute to the world.  In the coordinate system of human development, China has always closely connected its own destiny with the fate of the people of the world, and always combines the interests of the Chinese people with the interests of the people of all countries.

The more at this time, the more you must be soberly realized that the dynamic Zero-Covid is the anti-epidemic strategy of the lowest social cost. It is the best choice based on the current situation in China. huge loss.  It should be seen that the dynamic Zero-Covid does not require ""zero infection"", but to quickly and accurately cut the transmission chain to the occurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic. From a scientific perspective, the dissemination scene of the COVID-19 virus is very extensive and the transmission pathway is very complicated. As the virus continues to mutate, the propagation is high. The disease is easy to identify and diagnose. The pursuit of less infection, rather than ""zero infection"" means that once an epidemic occurs, early discovery, quickly enclosure, and cut off spread, which reflects respect for science and respect, and can minimize the impact of epidemic on economic and social development.  If you prepare everything from disadvantages, and strive to strive for the best results, you can be prepared to be unpareural, not panic, and firmly grasp the initiative. Omikon's mutant strains are aggressive, and we must never estimate the consequences caused by its popularity. From the characteristics of the virus itself, the mutant strain of Omikon is not a ""large flu"". It has strong infectiousness, fast transmission speed, high hiddenness, and large number of infections. Serious threats cannot be underestimated. From the perspective of the realistic national conditions of our country, on the one hand, my country has more than 1.4 billion people, and the population of 60 and above is 267 million. The population base is large and the number of elderly groups is large. There are imbalances between vaccine vaccination between different people. If you choose ""lying flat"", let the virus popular and spread a large -scale spread, regardless of ""defense"", only ""govern"", it will inevitably increase the risk of infection of susceptible people. , Serious losses in property, the final price will be huge. Persist in dynamic Zero-Covid, based on the early grasping, small, and grasping the foundation, and find out together to extinguish it together in order to control the epidemic at the lowest social cost and in the shortest time, and firmly grasp the initiative of the war ""epidemic"".  The ""tube"" for a while is to better ""put"". In the short term, strict prevention and control measures for the fierce epidemic will inevitably affect the economic and social development and the mass production and life of the people. Management is to promote healthier and lasting development. It must be soberly realized that only if the epidemic is effectively controlled, economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. On the other hand, some countries have continued to deteriorate after the announcement of the implementation of the ""Coexistence with COVID-19"", which eventually impacted all aspects of economic and social life: people who did not work or are looking for jobs due to poor long-term health conditions increased by 20 Wan; 1/4 company in the country said that the COVID-19 epidemic is a major reason for the shortage of corporate employees. This also shows that in the face of Omikon's mutation, ""lying flat"" is not advisable, and ""lying to win"" is impossible. If you do not control the epidemic in a timely manner, the impact on the economy and society will only be greater; insisting on dynamic Zero-Covid can ensure the sustainable and stable development of the economy and society with good prevention and control results.  Fighting with the epidemic is the wrestling of material and the spiritual confrontation; it is a contest of strength and a context. Adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation, Zero-Covid's tackling operation in Shanghai has achieved important stages of results; Jilin Province announced that cities and states have achieved the goal of Zero-Covid, and the scene of spring plowing on the black soil. Returning to succession; after 7 days of ""slow life"" in Shenzhen, the social dynamic Zero-Covid was realized. The city's industrial chain supply chain is steadily ""returning"" ... COVID is in line with national conditions, science, and effective. Maintain strategic determination, grasp the ""epidemic"" in one hand, grasp the development of one hand, take effective measures, and accumulate the victory as a big victory, we will be able to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, realize the prevention and control of epidemic, and economic and social development at the minimum cost, and to achieve the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development.

The two ""fire eyes"" laboratory, a Chinese -built ""Fire Eye"" laboratory, played an important role in achieving fast detection of samples and epidemic prevention and control.  At the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, Serbia had encountered difficulties due to medical conditions. At the critical moment, China extended a helping hand. In addition to providing anti -epidemic supplies and sending anti -epidemic medical expert groups, it also provided advanced anti -epidemic equipment as technical support.  On April 8, 2020, the Serbian government signed an online contract with China Huada Group to decide to build two ""fire -eye"" laboratories.

Beligvich, director of Serbian National Molecular Genesis and Gene Engineering Research Institute, who has witnessed the full process of the China ""Fire Eye"" laboratory, said that, thanks to China ’s help, Serbia has the most advanced laboratory in the region. A automated nucleic acid extract from China, equivalent to 10 skilled laboratory technicians, can greatly improve the detection efficiency while saving manual and avoiding mistakes, and protecting the safety of detection personnel to the greatest extent. It has greatly helped the epidemic disease that may occur since then.  In the early days of the laboratory's completion, six Chinese personnel fought side by side with more than 40 Pharma testers, working for 16 hours a day in the form of a rotation class.

After the ""Fire Eye"" laboratory was enabled, the two laboratory's total detection capacity reached 3,000 samples per day, which played a huge role in the Serbian anti -epidemic. As the construction team of the laboratory is about to return to China, Serbian President Wugci personally met the team members and praised China to give Serbia's confidence and courage to fight against the epidemic.

In recent years, from adhering to finance to the real economy to the real economy to promote the integration of the digital economy and the real economy, to the advancement of industrial foundation and the modernization of the industrial chain, a series of policies and measures have enhanced the innovative vitality and development of my country's real economy.

One by one, one by one, one anti -epidemic operation, all sectors of Hong Kong are in their eyes and remember them. Many citizens said in an interview that the central government fully supported the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to prevent epidemic prevention and resistance, so that the majority of Hong Kong compatriots felt the warmth of the motherland.  In recent times, the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong is gradually being controlled, and the number of new diagnosis cases has continued to fall. The stability control of the epidemic does not happen ""naturally"", nor is it brought by the so -called ""lying"" of the virus, but the central government's full support, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's main responsibility, the unity of all sectors of Hong Kong society, and work together, and common together The result of the prevention and control of the epidemic.

The results showed that 67.9%of the citizens of the interviewed believed that they insisted on ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" more in line with the overall interests of Hong Kong society. It is inevitable that the lives of more than 7 million Hong Kong citizens will face serious threats. The results of the prevention and control of the epidemic are not easy. To this day, we must consolidate and maintain it, and strengthen the determination and confidence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" to prevent rebound and never relax.  For Hong Kong, adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a necessary condition for its customs clearance with the Mainland. The prevention and control of the epidemic in Hong Kong is also an integral part of the national epidemic prevention and control. This determines that Hong Kong's anti -epidemic is not a matter of one city. At present, the epidemic is still in a period of great global epidemic, and the virus is constantly mutating. Omikon's strains have spread fast and have many people infected. When this situation, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government must fulfill the main responsibility of the main body to ensure that the material distribution, the use of facilities in place, and the implementation of epidemic prevention measures are in place to participate in the actual actions and results of resistance to resistance. The ardent expectations of all Hong Kong citizens.  At the entrance of the COVID-19 therapy center in Hong Kong, it is full of flowers and cards from the mainland citizens to thank the Hong Kong medical team. Here, the mainland and the Hong Kong medical team cooperate tacitly. In addition to being grateful to Hong Kong doctors, they are also called, saying that if one day in the Mainland, they are also responsible for themselves, and they are willing to dedicate a mind. Mainland doctors said that in the face of diseases, medical staff in the Mainland and Hong Kong are all trenches of comrades -in -arms, and their common wish is to control the epidemic. Two words, one sincerity, is equally sincere, equally moving. The results of the prevention and control of the medical team condensed the hard work of the medical team, compared the mind and mind, and cherished themselves.  The central aid of Hong Kong's resistance to Hong Kong fully reflects the flesh and blood of the Mainland and Hong Kong, fully reflects the care of the central government, and fully shows the institutional advantage of the ""one country, two systems"". No matter what difficulties are encountered, the central government is concerned, the support of the Mainland, and the joint efforts of all Hong Kong people, they will definitely go through the difficulties.

At present, we must keep an eye on the key growth of wheat plucking, dumping, grouting, etc., and implement technical measures such as stabilized production and increase in production such as water and fertilizer regulation and ""one spray and three defenses"". It's a pound. The agricultural and rural departments should continue to play the role of the sinking first -line contracting work group and the technology team, and strengthen classification management, accurate guidance, and fine services. The northwest and northeast areas should seize the final window period, try their best to expand the sowing area of spring wheat, and implement the area of intention to the field.  It is necessary to grasp the difficulties and circulate, continue to take multiple measures and ensure the supply of agricultural resources. Affected by the external environment, the continued rise in agricultural capital prices has increased the cost of spring farming production, which has become a prominent contradiction in the current spring farming production. It is difficult to ensure the harvest of food in agricultural supply. After the Central Finance subsidized the 2 billion yuan of food and agriculture last fall, this spring this spring subsidized 20 billion yuan, which effectively hedged the pressure on the rise in agricultural capital. At the same time, the country has released the food acquisition price this year, which has stabilized the expectations of grain and agricultural planting. At present, relevant departments should strengthen the monitoring of agricultural capital varieties and division prices, and master the situation of purchase, storage and transportation at any time. Focus on ensuring the supply of fertilizer pesticide production enterprises, organize the orderly production of enterprises, implement preferential transportation policies, put in time to put on national reserve fertilizer, and increase the supply of domestic market. Promote farmers' capital to households, guide farmers to use fertilizer scientific, and continue to carry out special actions of agricultural funds to fake counterfeiting, so that farmers are assured of fertilizer.  Hoving the harvest of summer food is the first tough battle to achieve a bumper harvest in the whole year, which is of great significance for opening a new game, adaptation bureau, and stabilizing the overall situation. With the ""big of the country"", maintain strategic determination and patience, coordinate the prevention and control of epidemic and spring plowing, and strive to capture the harvest of summer food.

""Really reflect the protection of life, people -oriented""  ""People's first, life first"" is the fundamental starting point and foothold of China's epidemic prevention and control. China's anti-epidemic practice shows that adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is an inevitable choice to adhere to the concept of people's supremacy and life first, and it is also the best practice of this idea.  ""The most important criterion for evaluating epidemic prevention policies is the effectiveness of life-saving.

Lucia Peranda, a professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Health Sciences, Brazil Rongxia is aggressive, and the general harm to a country has not been alleviated. Considering the huge base of China's population, only by adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" can we effectively curb the epidemic, maximize the health of the people's lives, and ensure the normal order of production and life.  Mark Fan Lance, a well-known Belgian virus, believes that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is a valuable experience that China has explored on the basis of respecting science and extensive practice. From successfully curbing the epidemic caused by the deera mutation strain to the strict prevention and control of the Omircor's epidemic, China has continuously improved the level of science and precision prevention and control, and timely curbing the spread of the epidemic. In the process of responding to this global public health crisis, China's epidemic prevention policy has been tested. Based on the current situation of China's epidemic, ""‘ dynamic Zero-Covid ’is the best choice for science and effectiveness.”  Ahmed Mandari, the head of the East China Sea Regional Office of the World Health Organization, believes that epidemic prevention and control is always a scientific issue. China's current anti -epidemic measures are scientific decisions made by repeated research and demonstration, studying the situation of the epidemic, and summarizing the experience of anti -epidemic. Actively carry out monitoring, quickly tracking and isolation of close contact with close contact, and partitional prevention and control. Effective measures in China have provided useful reference for other countries to better respond to the epidemic.

Since the epidemic in Shanghai this round, various districts and departments in Shanghai and departments have been in a sense of urgency and the execution of the battle. , Make efficiency, make up for shortcomings, and strong weaknesses, and promote various epidemic prevention and control measures to play a role. At present, the prevention and control of the Shanghai epidemic is at a critical stage. Only by unswervingly implementing the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy and taking resolute and powerful measures can we promote the inflection point as soon as possible and allow the social epidemic to realize Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  Racing with the virus is to race with time. The faster you run, the more you can grasp the initiative of war ""epidemic"". The strains that are popular in Shanghai's epidemic are mainly Omikon BA.2, and the transmission speed is very fast. Studies have shown that compared to Delta strains, the transmission speed of BA.1 of BA.1 is 77%faster than that of the BA.2 strain. Without any intervention measures, an Omikon infection will infected 9.5 people. In addition, Omikon's mutant strains are particularly hidden, asymptomatic infected and mild cases account for very high proportion, while asymptomatic infections and mild patients are also contagious. From a scientific perspective, leaving some opportunities for Omikon's mutant strains will quickly infection. Only by fast words, to strengthen risk management and control, to find out the source of infection by screening, and timely transport and isolation can it avoid large -scale transmission.  The people's supremacy and life first, curbing the epidemic as soon as possible is the truly respect for every life. From the perspective of public health, the entire crowd is the susceptible crowd of Omikon's mutant strains. At the same time, from the perspective of pathogenicity, the mutant strain of Omikon is by no means a ""large influenza"", and its harm must not be underestimated. Those countries and regions that are ""lying flat"" are much higher than that of the elderly and other fragile people than they are expected. Such as newborns with allergic asthma, or elderly people with basic diseases, once the virus infection is superimposed, it will cause the danger of severe illness. According to the report of the Shanghai Health and Health Commission, as of 24:00 on April 17, 16 patients with heavy patients received treatment at designated medical institutions were treated; on April 17, 3 cases of death were added, all of which were older, and at the same time, a serious foundation was merged. Diseases have not been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. This also fully illustrates that the harm of the popularity of Omiko's poisonous strains is still serious. In order to discover the epidemic, quickly deal with the epidemic, and strictly implement the prevention and control measures, we can control the source of infection, cut off the channels of propagation, and protect the sensible people.  To fast and fast, testing the efficiency of execution, but also the synergy efficiency. For example, in the treatment of infected people, if the positive infection and the densely connected person are not transferred in time, the epidemic will continue to spread in the community. Decisively promote the ""four response and four"", so that the infected person is treated, and the close personnel areolate the person in place; in the treatment and management of the square cabin hospital, due to the high number of infected infected by Shanghai COVID-19 virus Isolation treatment, it is necessary to further accelerate the construction of the square cabin hospital, strengthen the overall planning of resources, dig deep potential in each district, and unblock the discharge process, and achieve the positive cycle of the number of discharge as soon as possible. When it comes to energy, the more meticulous people's livelihood protection, the more meticulous. It must be arranged for the lives of the masses with deep feelings, paying more attention to the difficulties of the masses, and effectively ensuring the supply of medical medicines and food. The epidemic prevention and control took care of it. Grabbing the prevention and control measures of the epidemic, so as to achieve fast and orderly and efficient synergy in order to achieve the goal of Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  Fast is one of the essence of dynamic Zero-Covid. If you find that early and disposal are fast, you can timely cut off the epidemic transmission chain, and make social production and life return to the right track as soon as possible. Shandong Province announced on March 29 that this wave of epidemic since the end of February achieves social dynamic Zero-Covid, and the production and re-production has entered the ""fast track""; Shenzhen has pressed the ""slow key"" to implement a scientific and precise anti-epidemic strategy strategy By April 8th, it will be promoted in an orderly manner to return to schools at all levels to return classes; Jilin Province announced on April 14 that cities and states have realized the realization of society Zero-Covid, and the order of social production and life has gradually recovered ...

All aspects of various departments must have sufficient ideological preparation and work preparation. Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during his inspection in Hainan that it is necessary to ""improve various emergency plans, strictly implement normalization prevention and control measures, and minimize the impact of epidemic on economic and social development"", which is a good way to prevent and control the normalization epidemic. Work, better coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development have a significant guiding role.  The current epidemic prevention and control is facing a severe situation of complexity, arduousness, and repetition. From the perspective of virus characteristics, the characteristics of Omikon's mutant strains have the characteristics of fast transmission speed, hidden infections, and high proportion of mild cases, which are more likely to cause large -scale transmission. If it is not strictly controlled and controlled in a timely manner, the risk of susceptible people will increase the risk of infection, and eventually a large -scale rebound will be formed. Practice for more than two years has proven that the general strategy and principles of normalized epidemic prevention and control are correct and effective. Although Omikon's mutant plant has a strong propagation, as long as it can be discovered, early control, early treatment, early treatment, cut off the transmission pathway, and protect the people who are susceptible, they can still control the epidemic in a timely manner. This requires us to adhere to the overall strategy of ""external defense input, internal defense rebound"" and the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not shaking or relaxing. Early, faster, more stricter, and more realistic prevention and control measures to block the spread of epidemic conditions, and effectively and effectively protect the health of the people's lives and economic and social development.  In the face of the repeated impact of the epidemic, some people believe that the symptoms of Omikon's mutant strains are mild, and they are easy to relax and paralyzed. They have relaxed requirements for the prevention and control of normal epidemic and emergency treatment. It must be deeply realized that if no matter whether it is ""defense"" or ""governing"", my country's medical system will face the risk of breakdown. We must adhere to the organic combination of normalization and precise prevention and control and local emergency disposal. While doing a good job of preventing and controlling the prevention and control of the normalized epidemic, emergency preparations and effective disposal of the possible local epidemic conditions will be estimated to be more difficult. Think more seriously, preparation without any, and never fight without preparation. It is necessary to strictly prevent and control the port and border areas, adhere to the same prevention of people, things, and the environment, highlight the closed -loop management of personnel, compact the responsibility of preventing and control, enrich the prevention and control force, improve the normalized prevention and control mechanism, make up for the shortcomings of the shortcomings, build a firm outside, and build a firm outside. Anti -input defense. It is necessary to strengthen the normalized prevention and control of key places, urge schools, nursing homes, airports, railway stations and other dense places and units to compact responsibilities, strengthen daily monitoring and prevention and control requirements, and implement detailed prevention and control measures and emergency plans. It is necessary to expand the coverage of key population monitoring, strengthen the health monitoring of service personnel such as pharmacies, clinics, education institutions, and farmers' markets, give play to the role of ""whistle"" such as medical institutions, improve multi -channel monitoring and early warning mechanisms, and promote ""antigen screening, nucleic acid diagnosis"" monitoring ""monitoring Models, comprehensively improve the ability of epidemic monitoring and early warning and emergency response. It is necessary to coordinate the deployment and use of regional nucleic acid testing forces, prepare a full quarantine point and establish a reserve list and ladder opening mechanism, do a good job of planning and preparation of square -cabin hospital construction, and improve emergency response capabilities. It is necessary to strictly prevent and control the experimental code, temperature measurement, wearing masks, and maintaining social distances, continue to promote the elderly to strengthen immunization in order to strengthen the vaccine of the elderly, and build a group defense line control line.  Do a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic, which is directly related to the stability of the overall economic and social situation; to maintain the stable economic operation and the harmonious and stable social and stable in order to provide a solid support for adhering to the normalized epidemic prevention and control. It must be deeply realized that the normalized epidemic prevention and control is not an isolated policy, but a complex operating system. It can not adopt a ""one -size -fits -all"" approach to different regions, hinders normal economic and social order, and can not relax and prevent control. As a result, the predecessor was abandoned. Party committees and governments at all levels must unify their ideas and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, further sharpen the courage of responsibility, the wisdom of scientific prevention and control, the conspiracy of taking into account, and the ability to organize the implementation. Strong, resolutely keep the bottom line of no epidemic. We must continue to do a good job of ""six stability"" and ""six guarantees"", continue to improve people's livelihood, strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market, maintain economic operation in a reasonable range, and maintain the overall social stability. It is necessary to fully ensure that freight logistics, especially medical prevention and control supplies, necessities, government reserve materials, postal express delivery and other people's biological materials and agriculture, energy, raw materials and other important production materials, and effectively maintain the normal production and living order of the people. The more severe the epidemic situation, the more we must maintain the strategic determination, grasp the ""epidemic"" in one hand, and develop it with one hand. Coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, take more effective measures, and strive to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost.  Practice has proven that we have a completely foundation, condition, and capable of achieving ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Currently, it is the key period of the most vigorous prevention and control of the epidemic. In particular, we need to strengthen confidence and face difficulties. Strictly implement the measures of normalized epidemic prevention and control. Essence Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, condense our hearts, overcome difficulties, improve the normalized epidemic prevention and control and emergency emergency response mechanism, curb the spread of the epidemic spread as soon as possible, and resolutely win the winner. The normalized epidemic prevention and control of this tackling battle is a long -lasting battle, and the dual victory of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development.",epidemic prevention and control; emergency response; economic and social development; normalization; prevention and control measures;
567,Persevere in the 20 years of responsibility and mind,沈靖然;,11,4/18/22,9,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruXxYU7GZUdhm7HuumE9rkE2UyKgHEgNXB8BFZwG1wZ1TSCrBHRr3A3m3Ni90YdwrK2txF0rCF_8qH01phWqAZTr7-IhYvuV1v6F0oDCsqZ7oA==&uniplatform=NZKPT,"""After listening to your class, I am deeply touched, and we all learn from you."" Earlier this year, after the meeting meeting of the party members and cadres of the Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Honghe, Yunnan Province, a party member who came to the conference excitedly said.  The lecturer was Dai Honghui, the secretary of the party committee secretary of Kaiyuan City, Honghe Prefecture. Twenty years ago, Dai Honghui relied on a list of only names. He found the lost party members who closed the company like a needle.  From the party branch, which had only 15 people in the beginning, it has developed into a joint party committee covering 297 non -public economic organizations and 348 party members with 348 party members. Over the years, Dai Honghui has led everyone to strengthen the team members, set up a school aid, and support the epidemic. Prevention and control has given full play to the role of the pioneer of party members.  ""We really found home""  In 2002, 6 enterprises under the Kaiyuan Township and Township Enterprise Bureau have closed down and suspended production. Employees of enterprises have made their own way. Some of them are difficult for some party members to participate in organizational life normally. That year, the superior party committee appointed 49 -year -old Dai Honghui as the secretary of the comprehensive party branch of the Township Enterprise Bureau, and then the relevant person in charge gave her an important task: to organize the lost party members according to the list.  At that time, Dai Honghui, who was not familiar with party affairs at the time, was stunned at the list. The total list of 15 people had no other information except the name. No address, no contact information, where should I find? On behalf of Honghui, he frowned. After a while, she agreed with her teeth. ""Since the party organization gave me the task, I have the responsibility to complete this work.""  With the list, Dai Honghui came to the Local Public Security Bureau's Household Registration Division. After investigation, she got a list of 68 people and the corresponding address. ""There are too many surnames of the same name, there are 3‘ Liu Shouchun ’, 5‘ Bai Dingyou ’...” Dai Honghui said.  From the urban area to the village, from Xishan to Dongshan, the foam on behalf of Honghui's feet, and then found it after a short break. One evening, Dai Honghui came to No. 21 Chongwen Street, Kaiyuan City. This is the last ""Liu Shouchun"" home on the list. No one responded to the door, Dai Honghui tried to stuff a note from the door gap: ""Comrade Liu Shouchun, I am the current secretary of your party branch, please contact me, my passing machine number is ... ""  After getting home from get off work and seeing the note on the ground, Liu Shouchun immediately found a seat machine to fight. After a while, the two finally said in a passage and established a connection.  With the help of Liu Shouchun, Dai Honghui took 48 days and walked more than 300 kilometers. Other party members on the list were found one by one. During the first concentration meeting, the party members said, ""We really find home.""  ""If you want to give a glass of water, you have to have a bucket of water yourself.""  After the party members recovered, Dai Honghui applied for learning materials to the superior party committee, and tied it in and started to learn. From the knowledge of the party history to the latest documents of the central government, she must first study it by herself, and then tell the comrades of the branch.  ""If you want to give a glass of water, you have to have a bucket of water."" Dai Honghui said. Through explanations and discussions, most comrades have improved quickly. However, many people questioned: ""It's hard to go to work during the day. Is it necessary to grasp so tight at night?"" Every time he heard such a voice, Dai Honghui changed his ordinary good temper and persuaded him seriously.  After a long time, more and more people have found Dai Honghui and submitted an application for joining the party to the party organization. With the number of party members, in 2011, with the approval of higher -level party organizations, the comprehensive party branch of the Kaiyuan City Enterprise Bureau was changed to the general party branch; in 2015, Kaiyuan City established a joint party committee of non -public economic organizations, and the number of party members reached 177.  Most party members of the non -public economic organization and the party committee are entrepreneurs and individual households. At first, individual party members often asked for leave on the grounds of asking for business. In order to improve everyone's enthusiasm, Dai Honghui explores the use of learning points: Study once a month without participating in a deduction of 1 point; the deduction score is more than 3 points.  In addition to deducting points, you can add points to participating in social welfare activities. Party member Zhang Yuanli has been doing car accessories for more than 20 years. He frankly said: ""In the past, he only considered himself. Since knowing the acting secretary and affected by her, I will take the initiative to participate in some public welfare activities and make more contributions to society."" He deliberately bought tables and chairs, water dispensers, snacks, etc. at the door of the store, so that the cleaners and courier in the city could have a rest. ""The quantitative score is not to fight for high and low, but I hope that the party members can have a scale in their hearts, and always remember their responsibilities and obligations."" Dai Honghui said.  ""I don't have enough to do it, I need to double hard in the future""  Dai Honghui is 69 years old, and he is still motivated to do party affairs. On one occasion, Dai Honghui went to the party to give a party lesson. She accidentally fell before class. She insisted on talking for two hours. Dai Honghui said, ""So so many people come to listen to the party lessons, I will come here, so I have to finish the class.""  Dai Honghui's hard work, everyone looks in the eyes. Liu Shouchun often said to Dai Honghui: ""Your current physical condition is too bad, and you must check your body immediately."" The crowd repeatedly persuaded, and Dai Honghui went to the hospital for a detailed examination.  After many years of hard work, Shi Honghui's knee fell into a half -moon plate. During the prevention and control of the epidemic, Dai Honghui was posted on a plaster to keep the card on the front line with the party members. On the streets of Kaiyuan, a limping figure ran around in the community, streets and hospitals.  At the same time, the companies and merchants where the party members are located also organize donation activities to donate protective supplies, food and caring for the Red Cross of Kaiyuan City nearly one million yuan. In order to make more people feel the warmth of the party organization, since 2006, Dai Honghui and the party members of the branch at that time will donate to help students difficult. In 2012, the ""Golden Autumn Dream"" was established, and the total donation amount of more than 3 million yuan in many years was established.  Kong Tao, who graduated from the China Criminal Police Academy, is now a trainee police officer of the Honghe Prefecture's Lvchun Border Management Brigade. After he applied for the ""Golden Autumn Dream"" to help, Dai Honghui was worried that Shenyang was cold in winter and bought him a thick sweater. She often said to Kong Tao: ""Don't worry about the situation in the family, study hard, I will take care of you at home.""  In 2018, Kong Tao submitted an application for admission to the party's party organization. After writing the application, he told Dai Honghui for the first time, and Dai Honghui was very happy. Today, Kong Tao set a plan to regularly donate some of his salary to the ""Golden Autumn Dream"" student. Kong Tao said: ""At first, Auntie helped me dream, and I also wanted to pass on my dream.""  Last year, Dai Honghui was rated as ""National Outstanding Party Worker"". Looking back at the past 20 years, she said, ""I don't have enough to do it, and I have to work hard in the future.""",Non -public economy; township enterprises; party branch secretary; application for admission to the party; Kaiyuan City; 20 years; epidemic prevention and control; student assistance;

During the inspection of General Secretary Xi Jinping in Hainan, he emphasized that ""the new features of virus mutations and improved scientific and precise prevention and control skills."" In the face of the ups and downs of the epidemic spread of the century, we must be courageous to carry out suffering, difficulties, heavy responsibility, and danger, adhere to scientific prevention and treatment, accurate policies, and show the mission of excessive prevention and control skills and not humiliation.  Grasp the characteristics of recent epidemic dissemination with a wide range of points, wide -faced, and frequent epidemic dissemination, consolidate the hard -won anti -epidemic results, and maximize the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development, and urgently require us to improve scientific and precise prevention and control skills. In the prevention and control of the epidemic, from party members, cadres to medical workers, disease control staff, people's PLA, commanders, officers and soldiers of the Armed Police Force, scientific and technological workers, community workers, public security police, emergency rescue workers, volunteers, strictly carried out prevention Controlling the work of the round of epidemics, which to the greatest extent to protect the safety of people's lives and health. At present, the prevention and control of the epidemic at home and abroad has the characteristics of complexity, arduousness, and repetitiveness. The main popular Omikon variants in this round of epidemic are particularly fast, extremely hidden, asymptomatic and mild cases. The proportion is very high, which has potential serious threats to special groups such as elderly patients and patients with severe basic diseases, which has brought new challenges to the prevention and control of the epidemic. The more at this time, the more you have to keep your mind sober, the epidemic discovery should be earlier, the treatment of the epidemic is faster, the prevention and control measures must be more realistic, and the serving the masses must be more in place. Only by adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation, more resolute and decisive attitude, and more rapidly and more powerful, can we win this big battle as soon as possible.  The struggle with the epidemic is the wrestling of material and the spiritual counterpart. In the face of the repeated impact of the epidemic, some people have the idea of ""eloquent, rest, and so on."" alert. Battle with the virus of Omikon's mutant plant must be resolutely taken to resolutely take decisive measures to take the lead in the first and quick way in order to curb the spread of the outbreak as soon as possible. Otherwise Prevention and control results. It must be realized that ""people first and life first"" is the fundamental starting point and end point of my country's epidemic prevention and control. After multiple deaths with mutated plants with strong communication power, we must strengthen the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. Essence The current epidemic situation is still severe and complicated. It must be cautious. At all times, the string of the epidemic prevention and control is always maintained, always maintaining a fixed force and a fighting spirit. The vigilance of the epidemic spread cannot be reduced. Resolutely overcome paralysis thoughts, mood of war, luck, and relaxed mentality, and to create a strong spiritual defense line that unite and become the city.  To improve the skills of scientific and precise prevention and control, we must take the initiative to take the initiative and actively act, and grasp the measures to prevent and control the prevention and control of the epidemic. At present, all cities and prefectures in Jilin Province have achieved the target of Zero-Covid in the epidemic prevention and control of the epidemic. It turns out that we not only have the experience of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", but also have the ability to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". All aspects of various regions and departments must resolutely unify their thoughts and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee. It is necessary to speed up nucleic acid testing, the construction of squares, and the treatment of infection, and block the spread of social epidemic as soon as possible. It is necessary to strengthen risk control, quickly screen, find out the potential source of infection, and transfer and isolation in a timely manner. For places where the epidemic is more serious, the main leaders of the party and government and leading cadres at all levels must put the epidemic prevention work first, play sharply, and decisively win. It is necessary to put the original intention on action, the mission on the shoulders, and to build a solid barrier to prevent control from strictness, from early, from the morning, from the morning, and from the details, and from the details, from the morning, and from the details.  Grassroots are the first lines of joint defense joint control and group defense and group control, and are the key to ensuring the implementation of various measures. For a period of time, various fronts have adhered to their posts and continuous operations. It is very hard and difficult to make important contributions to curbing the spread of epidemic. Party committees and governments at all levels should pay more attention to care and help them solve actual difficulties and problems they encounter in time. We must resolutely correct formalism and bureaucracy, adhere to everything from reality, and reduce the burden on the grassroots. It is necessary to promote the sinking of the prevention and control resources and strength, and always pay attention to what the community prevention and control work lacks and difficulties. It is difficult to solve problems, provide more support, and guarantee work, life, and safety. It is necessary to fully mobilize the initiative of all aspects, work support, treatment, and psychological care, and further stimulate motivation and fighting spirit, let everyone put more energy into the front line of the epidemic prevention and control, and use more time to grasp the work. Implementation.  Coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, adhere to the scientific and precise, dynamic Zero-Covid, and the task is very heavy.

As early as 11 pm on March 7, Yu Linhui received a notice from the Zhaoxiang Town prevention and control office. Seven groups in Honghu Village found that a symptom -free infection needed to be closed and controlled 7 groups immediately. He quickly informed his colleagues to return to work and stayed on the bayonet for many consecutive nights. Everyone advised him to take a break. He resolutely refused to leave the post. ""The most critical moment, I am an old party member and should take the lead."" After all the nucleic acid testing of all employees was negative, he was slightly relieved.

At the nucleic acid sample scene, Yu Linhui took a small horn to maintain order with volunteers. Heavy rain was noticed, and it was more difficult to guide the work.

Racing with the virus, the correct direction and the faster you run, the more you can grasp the initiative of war ""epidemic"". The essence of the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast, the other is precise, based on the early grasping, small, and grasping the foundation, and found together to extinguish the bottom line that does not occur in the scale of the epidemic. Since the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, it is precisely because it has always adhered to the concept of ""people first, life first"", and adhered to the general strategy of ""external defense input, internal defense rebound"" and the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. The impact of a round of epidemic, quickly and effective disposal of dozens of local regions clustered epidemic, maximize the protection of people's lives safety and health, and effectively protects my country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control in the world's leading position. Facts have fully proved that the fast and accurate ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the effective magic weapon for controlling the epidemic in my country; the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" reflects respect for science and the law.  ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is determined by my country's basic national conditions. It is an inevitable requirement for our party to put people's life safety and health first. After the COVID-19 epidemic, although some Western countries are the world's leading medical technology, they have taken the so-called ""group immune"" and ""natural immunity"" to the high number of infections and diseases. Since some countries have announced the ""coexistence with the COVID-19 virus"" plan, the number of hospitalizations and death cases has increased, and the number of infections has continued to maintain a high level. my country has a special population and national conditions, which determines that it is necessary to actively respond to the epidemic and realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". It is necessary to soberly realize that the Omi Rong mutant strain is by no means a ""large influenza"", and its harm must never be underestimated. There are many regions in my country and a large population. There are differences in medical and hygiene conditions in various places. There are imbalances between vaccines between different people. In addition, the base of the elderly is large. In the end, a large -scale rebound will be formed, and the consequences will be unimaginable!  The key to determining the best solution of the anti -attack epidemic is how to control the epidemic situation at a smaller cost in a shorter time, reduce the adverse effects of the epidemic, and ensure the continuous and stable development of the economy and society with good prevention and control effects. my country adheres to the ""dynamic ZERO-COVID"", so as to do everything to maintain the safety and health of the people's lives, and do everything possible to effectively balance the prevention and control of the epidemic, normal production, life, and economic and social development. In order to achieve the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" and take measures such as seal control, control, control and control in places where the epidemic is serious, it will inevitably bring inconvenience to people's production and life. Life and a larger range of normal production life. It can be said that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best choice based on the current situation of my country's current epidemic. It is resolutely adopted to take strong prevention and control measures and strive to achieve ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" in a short time. It is still the most economical and most economical and most. Effective epidemic prevention and control strategy.  At present, the number of new local infections in my country is still high, and the spread of community epidemics in some regions has not been blocked. The scope of affecting the impact is still very large, and the prevention and control is in a critical period. The more severe the epidemic situation, the more we must maintain the strategic determination. It is necessary to see that Omikon's mutant strains have the characteristics of fast transmission, high -hidden infections, and high proportion of mild cases, and are more likely to cause large -scale spread. If the best time to resist resistance will lead to the expansion of the epidemic spread, the cost will be higher, and the loss of economic and social and people's health will be greater. Only ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" can eliminate hidden dangers of the epidemic, avoid the possibilities of medical resources caused by large-scale people infection, and prevent the death of the elderly and those who have basic diseases. Only fast words should be used as fast, so as to step up, step up the inspection of inspection, acceptance of acceptance, depends on, and cure, implement early discovery, early reporting, early isolation, early treatment requirements, can the local area be quickly controlled by the local area Gathering epidemic, maintaining the normal operation of the economy and society, and achieving the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost.  When the key period and state of the prevention and control of this epidemic, especially the spirit of firm confidence, carry forward the spirit of hard work and continuous operations, and more resolute and decisive measures to win the initiative in running with the virus.

Affected by this, Chinese descent began to encounter more and more discriminatory treatment in the United States. The most typical is the review and persecution of Chinese intellectuals. After the COVID-19 epidemic spread in the United States, the Trump administration continued to use racist speech to attack China in order to cover up the epidemic. While further deteriorating Sino -US relations, the entire Asian group, including Chinese, faces more serious racial discrimination. After the Biden government came to power, China used China as its main strategic competitors. This is also one of the causes of anti -Asian emotions in the United States at the moment. Based on this, even if the post -epidemic era may have faded even if American society's racial discrimination against Asian as Asianship, racial attacks against Chinese groups may be intensified.

Essence Since the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, my country has adhered to the concept of people's supremacy and life first, and adhered to the general strategy of ""external prevention input, internal defense rebound"" Quickly and effective disposal dozens of aggregate epidemics in local areas, to maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health. my country's epidemic prevention and control achieved the maximum results at a minimum cost. Economic development and epidemic prevention and control have remained global leading positions. my country's anti-epidemic practice fully proves that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with national conditions, science, and effective, and is the best practice of the concept of people's supreme and life first.  Recently, many provinces in my country have faced the situation of preventing and control of Omikon's mutation in many places at the same time, and the situation of preventing and controlling the situation is severe and complicated. The more at this time, the more you must adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy. From the perspective of the characteristics of Omikon's mutant strain, although its own pathogenicity is not as strong as other strains, it has the characteristics of strong contagious, fast transmission, and high hiddenness. It is easy to cause large -scale spread. If it is not strictly controlled and controlled in time, the risk of infection of susceptible people will increase, causing the squeeze of medical resources, and the consequences are unimaginable. From the perspective of the realistic national conditions of my country, the population of 60 and over has 267 million, and more than 50 million elderly people have not completed the COVID-19 vaccination. With the huge population base of our country and the large population size of the elderly group, if ""lying down"", regardless of ""defense"", only ""treat"", not only will it not only allow special groups such as elderly patients and serious basic diseases to face a serious threat of the virus. It may also form a scale rebound, which has greatly reduced the results of the impossible epidemic prevention and control, and even the east flow. It can be said that adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is an inevitable choice to adhere to the concept of people's supremacy and life first. It is the epidemic defense line that must be kept before 1.4 billion people.  Each person's life is safe and healthy, no one is a bystander, and everyone is the responsible person. It should be seen that the prevention and control of a normalized epidemic is a difficult and heavy work that requires a long time and persistence. Persistence means very difficult efforts, extremely tired persistence, and holding your teeth. Especially for places with severe epidemic situation, we can take measures such as seal control, control, and control. This is the last resort of the virus to force us to make, and it is also the effective response of practice to prove the effective response. In the long run, the inconvenience of a moment is for longer and convenient; the local persistence is for the larger and wider range of people's normal production and life. Supporting and cooperating with the prevention and control of the epidemic in accordance with the law, it is not only protecting themselves, but also to protect others, which can reduce the risk of cross -infection, but also contribute to the overall situation of epidemic prevention and control.  At present, the epidemic is still running at a high level, the scope of the affected is further expanded, and prevention and control are in a critical period. All aspects of various regions and departments must continue to adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation, firm confidence, more resolute and decisive, and implement various prevention and control measures to every link. The essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast, and the other is precise. It is necessary to run faster than the virus, in order to quickly improve, and truly put the prevention and control measures in detail, small, and implementation. Aiming at the new characteristics of virus mutation, improve scientific and precise prevention and control skills, improve various emergency plans, and strictly implement normalized prevention and control measures. It is necessary to maintain the smooth and orderly production and life of the masses, do a good job of production and supply of necessities of life, and ensure the needs of the masses. All aspects of various regions and departments must resolutely unify their thoughts and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee. For places where the epidemic is more serious, the main leaders of the party and government and leading cadres at all levels must insist on putting the epidemic prevention work first, fighting hard, and decisive victory. Party organizations at all levels and the majority of party members and cadres should continue to actively play a role, adhere to the front line of in -depth prevention and control, deeply root the masses, and help the masses to solve their problems with their hearts.  Persistence is victory, persistence will win, and persistence can win. After 45 days of hardships, all cities and states of Jilin Province have achieved the target of Zero-Covid, the social face prevention and control of the epidemic. This once again proves that we have a completely foundation, conditional, and capable ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, maintain a strategic determination, and use the toughness of ""the more difficult and danger, the more difficult the more difficult"", and continue to overcome difficulties and stubbornly fight.

As the US federal government and states have canceled anti -epidemic measures one after another, US public health experts expressed concern about the epidemic in the United States again in the United States, emphasizing that negative resistance will only cause greater harm to the health of the people.  Recently, the number of confirmed cases in the United States COVID-19 has reappeared. U.S. epidemiologists said that due to the reduction of COVID-19 virus testing and related subsidies, the incompleteness of epidemic data can be severely underestimated, which may be severely undervalued, and the severity of the epidemic is ""masked for"" covering up """" "".  COVID-19 in many places in the United States increased in the number of infection cases  The latest statistics from the COVID-19 epidemic released by Johns Hopkins University on April 14 showed that as of the 14th Eastern Time, there were more than 80 million COVID-19 confirmed cases in the United States. Essence The United States is the country with the largest number of confirmed cases and the largest number of deaths in the world.  According to US media statistics, since the end of March, the Capital Washington Columbia Special Economic Zone has doubled, and the number of cases in New York City has surged more than 60%. According to a report on the US Pediatric Society on April 4, as of the week of March 31, there were 27,521 new cases of children in the United States, and more than 12.84 million children had been diagnosed by more than 12.84 million children. In the past 4 weeks, more than 130,000 new children's diagnosis cases were added across the United States.  According to statistics quoted by the Broadcasting Corporation of the United States, in the past two weeks, COVID-19 confirmed cases of Nebraska have increased by nearly 80%, Arizona has increased by 75%, and Massachusetts has increased by 55%. In addition, the monitoring data of Waste Water COVID-19 virus concentrations show that the infection rate in Colorado, Ohio and Washington is also increasing.  Data show that the relevant cases of the infection of Omikon poison BA.2 account for 86%of the new cases in the United States, of which more than 90%of the infected people are in New York State, Massachusetts and other places. US media analysis believes that the urgency of government epidemic prevention funds has led to the weakening of COVID-19 virus testing. In addition, many states to cancel the prevention and control of epidemic conditions are the main reasons for the current surge in the US epidemic.  The United States ""Times Weekly"" reported that the United States may now be in a surge in cases and people do not know. A number of US health experts criticize the US government for ""self -deceiving epidemic prevention measures"".  The US ""News and World Report"" website says that the US public health experts, Fuqi, said that due to the continuous spread of Omikon's mutant strains with stronger communication, and the relaxation of epidemic prevention measures The rising trend is worrying.  The reduction of epidemic prevention expenditure will bring pressure on the epidemic response  In the context of the surge in the number of infections in the United States and huge pressure on medical institutions, relevant US agencies plan to significantly reduce the capital investment in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.  Recently, the US Parliament Senate announced a $ 10 billion COVID-19 epidemic. A package assistance plan, which is significantly reduced compared to the previously proposed $ 22.5 billion plan, and canceled the original plan of US $ 5 billion in international anti-epidemic assistance funds. Essence Criticism of domestic public opinion says that if the planned funds are reduced sharply, it will cause the United States to be unable to deal with multiple pressures caused by the epidemic and hinder the global anti -epidemic process.  The United States ""Politicians"" News Network reported that the Senate decided to delay the voting of the plan until the two -week break of the parliament in April. It is reported that the size of the aid plan has been greatly reduced because the Democratic and Republican Party is deadlocked in the border policy. Colombia Broadcasting Corporation pointed out that the COVID-19 rescue bill fell into the party's struggle trap.  ""The capital to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic"", the New York Times pointed out that the funds for providing COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatment to those who do not have medical insurance are exhausted. It is reported that if there is no capital investment, more Americans may infect the COVID-19 virus, which will not only lead to a avaruable loss of life, but also make the hospital overwhelmed. As the tools for saving life are getting more and more away from disadvantaged groups and colored race communities, the gap between medical care may worsen, ""the move in the United States will eventually harm the health of the people.""  Tadin Ritzvi, the research director of the ""Public Citizen"" of consumer rights protection organizations, criticized that the United States plans to reduce global anti -epidemic assistance and will have a ""devastating consequences"" on global vaccine vaccination and reducing the risk of virus mutation. Abandoning the responsibility of assisting the global anti -epidemic will cause the health of Americans to be in danger, ""the United States has abandoned the world.""  The politicalization of anti -epidemic leads to multiple evils  Bloomberg reported that as the US government stopped subsidies for the COVID-19 virus testing project, the scale of large-scale virus detection was significantly weakened, and people rely more on fast detection methods, which made it difficult for public health officials scope. ""The United States is in a new round of epidemic increase without knowing it.""  The U.S. Forbes magazine website reports that 21 states in the United States ""can't wait"" to cancel passengers' regulations on wearing masks when taking public transport. The article commented that prematurely canceling the ""mask order"" may lead to surge in COVID-19 cases, and one of the biggest tragedies in this epidemic is the politicalization of the American epidemic response measures.  American medical expert Peter Holtz wrote that the wave of anti -science in the United States has risen, and some political forces are difficult to blame. ""Political Magazine"" special writer Derek Robertson said that in the United States, the debate about the COVID-19 epidemic prevention measures and vaccine compulsory orders has long been separated from the scientific category and has become a chart of cultural differences in the year.  The American people have paid a huge price because of the government's chaotic resistance. The US ""Atlantic Monthly"" website reported on April 12 that nearly 1 million people in the United States died in the COVID-19 virus, which meant that millions of people lost their loved ones. They take months or even years to deal with sadness and the pain of losing their loved ones. However, most of the COVID-19 deceased are disadvantaged groups such as poor people and colored races. Such families lack psychological and health care.  (Our newspaper Washington, Beijing, April 14th)",Confirmation cases; health of life;

Both communities have established temporary party branches to screen out 13 party members to set up party members' assault teams, and various tasks can work quickly and efficiently.  Faced with the complicated and severe epidemic situation, Jilin Province fully implemented the provincial, municipal, district, streets, and community five -level secretary to prevent control and control.

As a large city, Shanghai has a large population density, frequent flow of people and logistics, and realizes the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" task. How to further prevent the epidemic prevention and control and realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" of society as soon as possible? How to do a good job of treatment of confirmed cases and asymptomatic infections? At the expert symposium held in Shanghai on April 11, some medical and health experts made suggestions.  Improve the screening measures, do a good job of preventing and controlling key areas and key populations  ""Omikon's mutant strain spreads very fast, and at the same time is very hidden. Once infected, it is often presenting family gathering, unit gathering, and rapid spread."" Chen Xin, deputy leader of the Disease Control Group of the Shanghai Prevention and Control Office, Chen Xin It is believed that ""screening, clearing, and control"" is the key to preventing and controlling the current epidemic. In conjunction with the level of epidemics, regional geography, population characteristics and other factors, we should dynamically optimize the ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combined screening strategy to improve the timeliness of the infected person.  Improve the efficiency of nucleic acid detection and screening. Lu Shan, a researcher at the Infectious Diseases Infectious Diseases Infectious Diseases of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, further highlights the key points on the basis of adopting existing nucleic acid testing and screening strategies. For example, the elite power of local medical institutions, illness and control departments, and third -party testing agencies focuses on protecting the heavier areas of the epidemic. For the large -scale points of clustering epidemic in the villages, large enterprises and construction sites, the ""two antigen+1 nucleic acid detection"" strategy is adopted to carry out rapid screening.  ""For old communities, rural rental houses, etc., all streets, towns and villages should classify and refine their responsibilities, implement responsibilities, and increase management and control."" Dean Wu Fan said that for communities and enterprises that continue to be high or still rising daily infected people, the reason for organizing professional forces has further analyzed the reasons for the continuous increase of daily infections since the sealing and control, including the characteristics of the infected person's gathering characteristics, possible, possible The implementation of transmission channels, implementation of prevention and control measures, etc. After the implementation of the three -level classification management, the area where the epidemic has declined, appropriately reduce the frequency of screening and save the screening force; the epidemic is still in high -level areas, increase the screening force, and increase the speed of the discovery and transportation of positive personnel.  Strengthen the prevention and control management of the epidemic in the concentrated employment unit and the suburban administrative village. Yuan Zhengan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, believes that at present, there is a trend of increasing the increase in the increase in the increase in the aggregate epidemic of centralized employment units and suburban administrative villages. It is necessary to compact the main responsibility of centralized employment units and strengthen the management of sealing and controlling the city's administrative village.  Effectively improve the vaccination rate of the elderly COVID-19 virus vaccine. At present, the overall vaccination rate of Shanghai vaccination is very high, but the two -pin vaccination rate between the aged 60 to 69 is 78%, the age of 70 to 79 is 61%, and the age of 80 is only 15%. Liu Yan, a researcher at the School of Public Health of Peking University, believes that the elderly are high -risk people with severe and death in the elderly. The vaccination work of the elderly should also be accelerated, and the treatment of elderly infection should be coordinated. It should give priority to all aspects of discovery, transfer, isolation, treatment, and health monitoring, and establish a specialized working mechanism to reduce as much as possible and death.  Activate the resource of a designated hospital and categorize the categorian infected  Ning Guang, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Dean of the Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, analyzed the low pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strains, low proportion of severe and hazardous severe types, but the proportion of patients with positive and basic diseases of virus There may be aggravation or even death. He suggested that asymptomatic infections, cases of milder cases, basic diseases infected, basic severe infections, and severe cases were classified. For fixed -point hospitals, recovery should be discharged as soon as possible and at the community for home health observation. Some cases without basic diseases can be transferred to the square -cabin hospital to revitalize the designated hospital resources.  Make full use of high -quality medical resources of designated hospitals. Ning Guang introduced that the expert treatment team and expert consultation group of the northern hospital of Ruijin Hospital established a regular consultation system for daily consultation. At the same time, the high -aged and high -level medical forces are sent to the front line to set up a specialized group to better treat the basic diseases of the infected person. It is recommended that all designated hospitals make full use of their own high -quality medical resources to open a specialized ward to enhance the ability to collect. The platform disciplines of designated hospitals must also be fully opened, such as anesthesia, blood banks, laboratory, pharmacy, etc. In addition, the treatment of special demand -infected infected with special needs such as ICU intensiveness, hemodialysis, and pregnancy as soon as possible.  Improve the ability to treat patients with severe illnesses. Ning Guang believes that in the future, more patients with severe illnesses may need to stay in the intensive care unit. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the number of beds in the intensive care unit of the designated hospital and properly open the instrument of the severe illness of non -fixed -point hospitals. At the same time, the number of doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit, strengthen training and guidance. In addition, the screening system for patients with severe illnesses is established to monitor the risks early. Once they turn heavy, they will immediately transfer to the intensive care unit for professional evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.  Strengthen the treatment of the isolation ward and the square hospital. Ning Guang suggested that experts should go deep into the clinical line and enter the isolation ward to conduct inspection and consultation on difficult and complicated cases. The isolation ward and square cabin hospital shall be equipped with psychologists, clinical pharmacists and Chinese medicine practitioners to establish medical, nursing, hospital sense, guarantee and administrative daily joint delivery system, formulate the daily list system, and improve the efficiency of treatment.  ""Medical institutions should maintain the lowest and necessary masses to see a doctor, but they should avoid intra -hospital infections caused by infected people."" Ning Guang said that medical institutions must strictly implement partition management, separate outpatients, emergency, and hospitalizations.

The high infection rate also has a huge impact on many industries such as education and aviation. More than 2,000 people in the British scientific community have recently issued joint letters and public letters, criticizing the ""coexistence with the COVID-19 virus"" plan to make fragile groups in danger.  In late February of this year, the British government announced the implementation of the ""Covalentrate with COVID-19 virus"" plans, canceled the COVID-19 diagnosis patients who need to beolate themselves, and no longer provide free testing services to the public, and ""transferred government prevention and control to personal responsibilities"". Essence The cancellation of a series of epidemic prevention measures caused a violent rebound in the epidemic, and the number of hospitalizations and deaths surged, and many hospitals announced that they had entered a ""serious crisis state."" At the same time, the number of ""COVID-19 long-term symptoms"" reached 1.7 million.  ""A large number of inpatient cases will continue, and death cases will continue to increase.""  According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics of the United Kingdom, in the week of April 2nd, nearly 4.9 million people in the UK had infected with the COVID-19 virus, and the number of infections continued to maintain a high level. Among them, one of the 13 people in England was infected with the COVID-19 virus, which was the highest level since the record.  According to statistics, during the week from March 21 to 27, the average daily residents caused by COVID-19 in the UK were 2115, which was more than doubled a month ago. In the same week, 988 COVID-19 death cases reported by the country, an increase of 36%over the previous week. According to the latest statistics of the Global Change Data Laboratory of third-party agencies, according to the population scale, the British COVID-19 mortality rate is 5.4%higher than the average mortality rate of EU countries.  John Edmondz, a member of the British Government Emergency Science Consulting Group and a professor at the University of London's Health and Tropical Medicine School, said in an interview with the Guardian that the situation in the British outbreak has deteriorated. In addition to faster the sub -type communication, it is important factor to cancel self -isolation and other prevention and control measures, increase in social activities, and reduce self -protection measures such as wearing masks. The number of infections is expected to continue to rise in the next few months, ""a large number of hospitalization cases will continue, and death cases will continue to increase.""  Kara Steel, a senior statistician of the National Bureau of Statistics, pointed out that the epidemic is still in the high level in the UK. The infection rate in England and Wales is innovative, and the infection rate of elderly groups has increased significantly.  The number of infections continues to rise, causing people to worry about virus mutation. The monitoring data of the British Health and Security Agency showed that as of April 5, the United Kingdom had reported 1125 cases of COVID-19 virus XE strains. The strain is the reorganized strain of Omikon BA.1 and BA.2 subtypes, and the transmission speed increases by 21%compared to the BA.2 subtype.  Patrick Varance, chief scientific adviser to the British government, said that the epidemic is far from over, and the evolution of the COVID-19 virus has ""a lot of space"". Sex will be reduced. ""  Danny Altman, a well-known British infectious disease immunologist and a professor at the Empire Institute of Technology, believes that at this stage, the COVID-19 virus is still an unbearable ""rampant"" virus, which can lead to repeated infections, leading to people Unable to go to school or work, leading to a large number of deaths.  Harris, head of the British Health and Security Agency, said that from the next 18 months to two years, the COVID-19 epidemic situation is still difficult to predict, which is a broad consensus.  ""The long-term symptoms that may occur in COVID-19 virus continues to put pressure on the medical system""  The ""coexistence with COVID-19 virus"" plans to make British medical systems under tremendous pressure. Inpatient patients surged, medical staff had a serious shortage, and medical institutions were overwhelmed. At present, the national hospital bed occupation rate is 94%. Medical staff who were absent from the COVID-19 virus increased significantly, and averaged 28,500 daily absence.  The British ""Daily Telegraph"" reported that many British hospitals have announced that they have entered a ""serious crisis state."" 6 medical institutions in England said that the emergency waiting time is generally up to 12 hours. ""Unless a serious accident or life is dying"", patients are not recommended to come to the doctor.  The new wave of epidemic has exacerbated the crowding of medical resources, and the number of waiting surgerys of the British National Health Service System (NHS) set a new record, and medical staff continued to be short -short. There are 6 million patients waiting for treatment. According to predictions, the number will increase to 14 million by 2024. A latest survey shows that the British people have only 36%of the satisfaction with NHS medical services, down to the lowest point in 25 years, a decrease of 30 percentage points from 2019.  McDmotmot, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of London, said: ""The long-term symptoms that the COVID-19 virus may occur in the infection of the COVID-19 virus continues to put pressure on the medical system. Medical and fiscal expenditure further affects the economy. ""The Financial Times quoted a study of the British National Bureau of Statistics that the number of"" COVID-19 long-term symptoms ""in Britain reached 1.7 million. Among them, the daily life of 2/3 people is affected, and the daily activities of 1/5 people are seriously limited.  A study published by the British Medical Magazine recently pointed out that the risk of patients infected with COVID-19 viruses increased by 33 times within 30 days, and the risk of deep vein thrombosis increased by 5 times, and the risk of bleeding increased. Studies have pointed out that even patients with COVID-19 milder patients, the risk of deep venous thrombus and pulmonary embolism will increase slightly.  ""Weaken Britain's ability to deal with a new wave of epidemic in the future""  The high infection rate has a serious impact on the economic and social operations of the UK. According to the latest data from the British Ministry of Education, on March 31, the number of absences of the British public primary and secondary schools reached 179,000, which was 1.7 times a month ago. On the same day, about one of each of the 11 teachers was absent from COVID-19, and 20%of public primary and secondary school teachers were absent from 15%. The Secretary -General of the British School and Academy Leadership Association, Barton, said that the number of teachers and students in the school will continue to increase, teaching activities will continue to be affected, and the government education department's response measures will be ""chaotic.""  According to the British Small Enterprise Federation, 1/7 companies are currently unable to operate properly due to the epidemic. According to the Times, many British airlines have canceled flights due to increased employee infection. On April 7, Yijie Airlines canceled 72 flights and British Airlines canceled 50 flights. Yijie Airlines said that the lack of commissioning is twice as much as possible.  The criticism of the criticism of the ""Coexistence of the Covid-19 virus"" in the United Kingdom has continued to rise. A few days ago, more than 2,000 people in the British scientific community urgently issued a joint letter saying: ""We do not believe that this policy is based on a solid scientific basis, which will make it difficult for new mutant strains to be discovered."" De Nag Paul believes: ""The British government's policy has caused fragile groups to be in danger."" Chief Medical Counselor of the British government warned that the current British epidemic was not optimistic and prematurely unpopularly unreasonable.

583,The life expectancy of the United States has decreased for two consecutive years,李志伟;,17,4/14/22,71,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWa18T3lV7BSVIom52w4Zlnz67QEKDo8ic8qBCm03ntraGF-e_8JP_lZGfiwbflcbnhOm-B3zLewsqiGTuX7cuWKDjIh9CSiBKAhVlVcAwNa62OYYl1SCIx&uniplatform=NZKPT,"Recently, a research report in the United States pointed out that due to the raging epidemic of COVID-19, the life expectancy of the United States has continued to decline in the past two years. The first author of the research report and the University of Colorado's sociologist Ryan Mastus believes that social factors such as inequality, systemic racism, and unsuitable economy have led to a sharp decline in the expectations of the United States per capita life span.  The research report was written by public health experts in Colorado, Virginia and Washington. The report shows that the per capita life expectancy of the United States in 2019 was 78.86 years old. In 2020, the data dropped sharply to 76.99 years old, and in 2021 continued to decline to 76.6 years. ""These are rare declines in history.""  The report found through horizontal comparisons that among the 20 wealthy countries that have been statistics, the per capita life expectancy of the United States has declined in the past two years. The per capita expectations of the other 19 wealthy countries have declined slightly in 2020, and they have increased in 2021. The United States is the only country that has declined for two consecutive years. Laodan Allen, one of the reporters of the report, said: ""The expected life gap between the United States and other countries in the same income is now more than 5 years old, which is incredible.""  The analysis pointed out that this research highlights many problems in the United States' response. The ""Time"" Weekly website reports that during the epidemic period, the problem of not obtaining medical treatment is common in American medical institutions: emergency rooms are full; ambulances can not find the intensive care unit that can be performed by first aid; -19 Patients' surge was forced to postpone other non -emergency surgery. The American Cable Television News Network quoted experts as saying that this was the consequence of the poor response of the United States.  Due to racial inequality in the medical and health system, the US minority ethnic groups were most affected in the early stage of the epidemic. The report shows that the expectations of African and Latin Americans in the United States in 2020 fell 3.22 and 3.7 years, respectively, while white expectations fell by 1.38 years. The Washington Post pointed out that in 2020, the U.S. -American and African -American people's expectations have declined more than the historic decline during World War II. The life expectancy of ethnic minorities is much significant than white people, reflecting the ""impact of the non-proportional impact on the race"" of the COVID-19 virus.  The report also shows that the decline in life expectancy in 2021 is mainly reflected in the white American group. The author of the report analyzed that in some states with high population proportion, people's rejection attitudes and anti -epidemic prevention measures may be a reason for this situation.  The Washington Post pointed out that the life expectancy of the United States is the result of the common effects of social, economic, medical, and politics. Over the past 10 years, an obvious factor is the crisis of drug excessive amounts, which is mainly caused by the flood of opioid drugs, which affects the expectations of Americans.  At present, the phenomenon of domestic political polarization in the United States has become increasingly serious, leading to politicization of epidemic prevention. Some politicians have repeatedly published anti -scientific and abnormal speeches, and a large number of people have been misleaded by false information. Graig Gunsarvis, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health, Yale University in the United States, said that the United States wanted to leave the epidemic in disregarding, ""this prompted us All are in danger. "" Norin Goldman, a population statistical at the University of Princeton, said that data with a decreased life expectancy of the United States made her ""incredible and the United States performed very badly in this epidemic.""

All aspects of various regions and departments must deeply understand the complexity, arduousness, and repetition of the current domestic and foreign epidemic prevention and control, further mobilize, unify their minds, firm confidence, persistently, and grasp various epidemic prevention work. We must always adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, adhere to the scientific and precise, dynamic Zero-Covid, and curb the spread of the epidemic spread as soon as possible.  Recently, my country's newly added local diagnosis cases and asymptomatic infections have grown rapidly, showing the characteristics of many, wide, and frequent occurrences, and the epidemic situation in individual regions is still running high. In order to curb the spread of the epidemic spread as soon as possible, all sectors of society unified their thoughts and condensed consensus, and adhered to the ""dynamic Zero-COVID"" general policy of not hesitating, and all walks of life personnel adhered to their posts, diligently work, and carried out various epidemic prevention and control measures. Essence  Adhering to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best solution for Shanghai resistance  At present, the prevention and control of the Shanghai epidemic is at the most important stage. Adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is the best choice and the best solution.  ""Shanghai is a very aging city. Once you lie flat, you are likely to cause the elderly and other fragile people to be severely ill and death, and to bear it."" Wu Huanyu, deputy director of the Shanghai Disease Prevention and Control Center, said that Shanghai's current round The epidemic strains are mainly Omikon BA.2. The propagation speed is very fast and the hidden nature is particularly strong, that is, the proportion of asymptomatic infections and mild cases is very high, which greatly increases the difficulty of prevention and control of epidemic. Omikon variants are by no means a ""large influenza"", and the harm cannot be underestimated. Looking at the ""lying flat"" countries and regions, the disease rate of the elderly and other fragile people is much higher than expected.  ""My jurisdiction belongs to the old town, there are many elderly people, many foreigners, and high degree of dense personnel."" Wu Chunhui, director of the Nanjing East Road Police Station of the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, introduced that there are a large number of old -fashioned residential buildings in the jurisdiction, many gas gas, many gas gas It is shared with sanitary facilities, and there is a risk of cross -infection. In addition, the resistance of the elderly group is weaker. Only by quickly curbing the spread of the epidemic can it better protect them. Facing the complicated and severe epidemic situation, all the police officers of the Nanjing East Road Police Station were dispatched. Under the conditions of closed and centralized management, they should be met in accordance with the community to take control measures to maintain order.  Shanghai citizens are actively actively achieving the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" as soon as possible. ""As a resident, we must do what we can do and actively participate in the prevention and control of the community epidemic."" Zhao Zhichao, a resident of Xinjiangwan City Street, Xinjiangwan City, Yangpu District, said that some neighbors are doctors and fight on the front line of resistance; Registration has become a volunteer, helping to transfer supplies overnight; some assisted the community neighborhood committee to guide residents to do a good job of nucleic acid testing ...  my country has the ability to realize ""dynamic Zero-Covid""  Since the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, my country has adhered to the concept of ""people first, life first"", and adhered to the general strategy of ""external prevention input, internal prevention and rebound"" The clustering epidemic has to maximize the protection of the people's lives and health, and my country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a global leading position.  ""my country actively responds to the epidemic and strives to achieve 'dynamic Zero-Covid' in order to better protect the safety and physical health of the people."" Xie Shangguo, the president of Guangxi University for Nationality University, said that my country is a big country. The population base of more than 1.4 billion is absolutely large. Omikon's mutant plant has a strong propagation. If the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy is abandoned, the safety and health of the people will be greatly threatened and economic and social development will be greatly hit. my country has always adhered to the concept of ""people's supremacy, life first"", and puts the people's lives safety and health first. For more than two years, my country has given full play to the institutional advantages of the Communist Party's leadership and socialist concentration forces to do major events, and we have held the impact of the round of epidemic. It turns out that my country has the ability to realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" and can achieve maximum prevention and control results at minimal social costs.  ""It can be achieved in my country to realize the social"" dynamic Zero-Covid '. ""Wu Huanyu analyzed that although Omikon's mutant strain spread quickly, as long as it was discovered early, early control, early treatment, cutting off the spread of communication, Protecting the sensible people can still control the epidemic in a timely manner. The ""weapons"" of my country's anti-epidemic are also continuously enriched: large-scale nucleic acid detection and antigen detection technology and capabilities have been continuously improved, and COVID-19 virus vaccination is promoted rapidly.  Li Yang, deputy general manager of the Operation Control Center of Beijing Capital International Airport Co., Ltd., said that as an important port hub, Beijing Capital International Airport has for immigration aircraft, passengers, units, luggage, goods, etc., as well as all staff and all staff participating in immigration flights and All the items are implemented in closed -loop management, and at the same time, the epidemic prevention measures are dynamically adjusted according to the epidemic situation. ""Only by achieving the‘ dynamic Zero-Covid ’and quickly and effectively control the epidemic, can we maintain the normal operation of the economy and society and ensure the safe travel needs of the masses.""  Work hard to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost  Wu Yiping, a professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, believes that the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" comprehensively considers my country's huge population base and the high proportion of the elderly, and is also the best choice based on the epidemic situation at this stage. The full chain prevention system should be constructed. When an epidemic occurs, it should be identified, disposed of quickly, and curbing the scale rebound in time. For example, the grass -roots government and communities do a good job of prevention and propaganda work, so that the masses will timely and accurately obtain the epidemic information information in the area; urban closed management period, innovate the use of government -enterprise cooperation, to ensure the basic lives of the masses; carry out psychological guidance, enhance the masses' anti -strikes The determination and confidence of the epidemic.  ""Although the epidemic situation is currently severe and complicated, for each positive infection, the illness and control department still does not relax in the shortest time."" Wu Huanyu said that the Shanghai disease and control department combined with the epidemic dissemination of the newly spread of the epidemic dissemination. Features, by understanding key information such as the method of discovery, vaccination, and secret personnel of each positive infection, quickly analyze and judge the characteristics, trends, and risk points of the epidemic, and propose targeted prevention and control measures to achieve ""dynamic Zero- Covid ""lay the foundation.  ""What we do now is to help Shanghai realize the 'dynamic Zero-Covid' as soon as possible."" Chen Yagang, deputy medical dean of the medical team of Shanghai Fang Card Hospital in Zhejiang Province, introduced that his medical team was responsible for about 5600 Management and treatment of beds. He believes that compared with the home, the square -cabin hospital has a better isolation environment. It is an effective means to control the source of infection and cut off the channels of communication. It can also provide the necessary medical support for the infected people.  ""We strictly follow the requirements of the epidemic prevention and control department, and implement a series of measures to prevent and control the stations and train epidemic."" Shi Zhengwei, the webmaster of Hangzhou East Railway Station, said that the station carefully implemented temperature measurement and codes. And temporarily close the transfer channel to help block the epidemic spread chain. At the same time, the station strengthens the management of employees' prevention of epidemic prevention, urges employees to strictly adhere to the requirements of less flowing, non -gathering, etc., compact units and personal epidemic prevention responsibilities, and improve relevant emergency plans. Standing from the railway epidemic prevention pass.  The masses in the seal -controlled area encouraged and helped each other, laying a solid foundation for curbing the spread of the epidemic.

""At a press conference held by the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism on the 12th, the spokesman and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the National Health Commission and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department Mi Feng said that it is necessary to speed up, accelerate the detection of nucleic acids, the construction of squares, and the infection of the infection, and block social communication as soon as possible. It is necessary to strengthen risk control, quickly screen, find out the potential source of infection, and transfer and isolation in a timely manner. It is necessary to effectively ensure the basic life of the masses and the needs of medical purchase of medicines, and actively help solve problems.  From March 1st to April 11th, 31 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have reportedly reported 32,5303 local infections, which spread to 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Lei Zhenglong, deputy director and first -level inspector of the National Health and Health Commission Disease Control Bureau, said that with the implementation of the epidemic prevention and control measures in various places, the area where new epidemic conditions occur in the epidemic situation can be quickly and effectively disposed without forming a new scale epidemic. Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shandong and other provinces are generally controllable. The epidemic in Jilin Province is generally declining, but it is still high; the number of new infections in Changchun City declines every day, but the community communication in the management and control area has not been completely blocked. It still needs to continue to strengthen various prevention and control work in the control area. The number of new infections in Shanghai for 8 consecutive days in Shanghai has exceeded 10,000 infected people. The epidemic is in a rapid rise. The community communication has not been effectively curbed, and the provinces are overflowing. It is expected that the number of new infections in the next few days will still be at a high level.  Xu Zhengbin, deputy director of the Economic Operations Bureau of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that since the recent epidemic situation in some areas, the National Development and Reform Commission has comprehensively launched the relevant working mechanism of living materials guarantee. The key tasks include: strengthen monitoring and scheduling, establish a system of living materials daily newspapers in key areas of the epidemic, and follow the government. Reserve and commercial inventory, market supply, price fluctuations, etc., timely discover the problem of signs and take targeted measures. Establish a fully covered sub -contract coordination mechanism, strengthen the connection with the provinces and cities, and timely understand the guarantee of living materials and difficulties, and help coordinate and resolve. At the same time, actively supervise and coordinate, do a good job of production and sales, and strengthen key guarantees.  ""Generally speaking, in recent periods, the supply of important people's livelihood products across the country is abundant, the price is basically stable, the price of grain and oil has remained stable, the price of pork has continued to operate at a low level. It is also necessary to see that since mid -March, the price of vegetables has been affected by the occurrence of the epidemic, which has caused the logistics to be blocked and the cost increase has risen, especially in Shanghai, Changchun and other places. Recently The price began to gradually fall.  Li Dang, deputy director of the Department of Consumption Promotion of the Ministry of Commerce, said that in response to key areas of the epidemic prevention and control, the Ministry of Commerce has launched the joint insurance and confession mechanism of the ""multi -party gang"" to timely mobilize the market resources and market resources of the surrounding provinces and the provinces of living materials. Conservation forces to maintain normal operation in key areas. As of April 11, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Ningxia and other provinces have accumulated 18,000 tons of vegetables in Shanghai, 850 tons of rice noodles, and 500 tons of meat and eggs. It supports more than 5,400 tons of food such as vegetables, fruits, milk, bread, canned food.  Li Dang will introduce that for the control of freight vehicles in some areas and ""one -size -fits -all"" control in the delivery of storage storage, it has led to a series of problems such as the decline in cross -regional capacity and affected supply.

At present, the proportion of light cases and asymptomatic infections in my country. Some opinions believe that concentrated isolation has the risk of squeezing medical resources. It is recommended that home isolation, but some people believe that the home isolation of asymptomatic infected people will have a large hidden danger of social communication. Wu Zunyou, chief expert of the Popular disease of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, explained that some of the asymptomatic infected people are likely to be in the incubation period of confirmed cases. After a period of observation, symptoms will occur and even develop severe disease. There is a risk of home isolation. One is that it may continue to cause the spread of the epidemic, and the other is that if the disease is not found in time, the best treatment period may be missed, and it may develop into severe illnesses or even pose a threat to life. If you have mild and asymptomatic infections, you should focus as much as possible at the fixed -point isolation point as much as possible for isolation and observation.  Some infected people are too late or have not been transferred to the isolation point for treatment. Wu Zunyou said that first of all, it is necessary to reduce the spread of intra -family. Infected people should live in a bedroom alone. It is best to have an independent bathroom and not to eat with their families. Second, reduce the risk of transmitted to neighbors or other residents. Families in the infected people should disinfect the living rooms and bathrooms in a timely manner. Family members of the infected people cannot go to the door with a chance. During the seal control management and health monitoring, each resident should pay attention to observing the changes in their physical condition, and whether there are symptoms such as itching of throat, sore throat, cough, and fever, and self -test through antigen detection methods. If there is suspected symptoms or positive antigen detection screening, contact the local epidemic prevention department in time.  As of April 11, a cumulative report of COVID-19 virus vaccines across the country was 3.328 million doses, and the number of people who completed the whole process was 1.244.923 million.

Dynamic Zero-Covid 'General Principles do not hesitate, shake, firm confidence, more resolute and decisive, and implement various prevention and control measures to every link. ""Why should we adhere to the"" dynamic Zero-Covid ""? Why is ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" the best choice based on my country's current epidemic situation at this stage? Whether you can correctly understand these issues, the condensation of the fighting epidemic, and the overall situation of the epidemic prevention and control work.  It should be seen that strict prevention and control measures for the fierce epidemic will inevitably have a temporary impact on economic and social development, people's production and life. The key to determining the best solution of the anti -attack epidemic is how to control the epidemic situation at a smaller cost in a shorter time, reduce the adverse effects of the epidemic, and ensure the continuous and stable development of the economy and society with good prevention and control effects.  my country's adherence to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the basic requirement to implement the concept of ""people first and life first"". From the perspective of virus characteristics, the characteristics of Omikon's mutant strains have the characteristics of fast transmission speed, hidden infection, and high proportion of mild cases, which are more likely to cause large -scale spread. If it is not timely and strictly prevent and control, the risk of susceptible people will increase the risk of infection, and eventually form a scale rebound, which will cause panic in the masses, cause medical resources to be crowded, and make normal medical needs cannot be guaranteed. From the perspective of my country's national conditions, the population of 60 and over reached 267 million. Data show that more than 50 million elderly people have not completed the COVID-19 vaccine in vaccination. Although the pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strain itself is not as strong as other strains, it is by no means a ""large influenza"" and has potential serious threats to special groups such as elderly patients and patients with severe basic diseases. It can be said that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is determined by the basic national conditions of my country, and is determined by the concept of ""people first and life first"" that my country has always adhered to.  To promote the prevention and control of the epidemic, it is necessary to count the front accounts, but also the long -term account. In the short term, because of the prevention and control of the epidemic, a local economic and social and mass life will indeed be affected. However, from a country and a whole, prevent the spread of the epidemic, in exchange for a larger and wider range of people. It is a more relaxed and stable economic and social development environment. The restoration of the normal dynamic cycle of the economy and society is based on the effective prevention and control of the epidemic. The sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the impact of economic and social development. On the contrary, if the best time to resist resistance will lead to the expansion of the epidemic spread, the cost will be higher, and the loss of economic, social and people's health will be greater. The ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" better balances the relationship between the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of the economic and social development. It can allow us to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost and minimize the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development. Because of this, we must adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation, and strictly implement prevention and control measures to every link.  Practice is the most powerful persuasion. In 2021, the epidemic brought by the deerta mutation strain once spread to more than 20 provinces. my country adheres to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy, quickly adopts prevention and control measures, facing Delta mutant strains, and effectively disposes more than 30 clustered epidemic conditions. Basically, the epidemic is controlled with a latent period (14 days). This also fully shows that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with my country's national conditions and science. It is the best choice for my country's current anti-epidemic situation. Epidemic prevention and control strategy.  At present, various epidemic prevention and control measures in Shanghai are playing a role, and Shanghai has the foundation, conditions, and capable of achieving ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".

The report issued by Boston Consultation predicts that from 2020 to 2025, the global digital payment revenue scale will increase by 7.3%, and the number of digital payment revenue will reach US $ 2.9 trillion by 2030. Many countries have actively introduced encouraging measures to accelerate the promotion and popularization of digital payment.  Egypt--  Electronic wallets are the first choice for payment and transfer  Maxi Saway works in a computer city in the Egyptian capital Cairo. During the work gap, he paid the water and electricity costs, gas fees and telephone bills of the month through the software Fawry. ""Even if the user does not have a bank account or credit card, relying on FAWRY, you can also pay various bills through other service outlets such as electronic wallets, automatic cash machines, retail stores."" Saway admitted that he has not dealt with cash for a long time.  Fawry is a Fintech company headquartered in Cairo. It creates Egypt's first and largest electronic bill payment platform. Currently, it provides more than 250 electronic payment services for more than 500 cities and 150,000 service outlets in the country. According to reports, FAWRY has tens of millions of users, dealing with more than 2.1 million transactions daily, and daily transactions reached 2.5 billion US dollars.  A survey results from the Egyptian Institute of Research showed that during the prevention and control of the epidemic, the amount of cash transactions in Egypt was reduced by 85%, the amount of digital payment and the amount of payment of goods jumped by 690%, and 90%of users said that they had confidence in electronic payment. Husham Ibrahim, a professor of finance and investment at Cairo University, said in an interview with this reporter: ""Electronic wallets have become the primary choice for most Egyptians to pay and transfer, because it is more convenient than other payment methods, and reduces reduction of other payment methods, and reduces reduction and reduced reduction. The burden of currency printing and recycling. ""  Egypt's ""2030 Vision"" takes vigorously developing digital payment and electronic finance as an important part. At present, Egypt's digital payment technology departments include 39 banks, 39 insurance companies, 900 small financing financial companies and private social organizations, 44 mobile phone network operators and 50 electronic payment companies. ""This provides strong support and enhancement space for digital payment in Egypt. Egypt's electronic finance and paperless economy will definitely develop more vigorously,"" said Ibrahim.  Singapore--  Digital payment changes from convenience selection to basic service  Online shopping, taxi, and takeaway ... Azari, 29, is from Singapore. Electronic payment has become part of his daily life. ""During the prevention and control of the epidemic, this method is both safe and healthy, and fast and convenient."" Azari said that using electronic payment can also get reward points or cash rebates.  According to statistics, in the first 10 months of 2021, the Paynow transaction volume of Singapore's cross -bank transfer service system reached 185 million, a significant increase from 109 million in the same period last year. From 2019 to 2020, Paynow's transaction volume and transaction volume doubled. About 75%of Singapore's current merchants are using the GM QR code as a payment method.  In order to promote the widespread application and development of electronic payment, the Singapore Financial Administration has set up a payment committee, including banks, payment service providers, and corporate associations to jointly promote industry innovation cooperation. In 2018, the Singapore government launched the nation's shared payment QR code ""SGQR"" to support a variety of payment models. No matter which mobile payment application is used, consumers can scan the same QR code payment.  In order to protect consumer rights, the Singapore government passed the payment service law in 2019 to supervise Singapore's payment service providers. The government has also arranged digital ambassadors and business consultants through many plans to promote digital payments among groups such as hawkers, elderly people, etc. to help them adapt to digital society.  The ""2021 Southeast Asia Digital Economy Report"" jointly released by Google, Temasek, and Bainian shows that Singapore e -commerce in 2021 increased by 45%year -on -year, with a total of $ 7.1 billion in commodity transactions. Jacqueline, head of the personal financial service department of the Dahua Bank of Singapore, said that digital payment is changing from a convenient choice to a basic service.  Brazil--  Promote more consumers to contact digital payment  In recent years, Brazil's choice of cashless payment consumers are gradually increasing. Data show that in 2020, the proportion of Brazilian cash transactions was 35%, compared with 47%of the previous year, a significant decline.  In the process of promoting cashless payment in Brazil, the real -time electronic payment system PIX launched by the Central Bank of Brazil in November 2020 played an important role. Relying on personal bank accounts, Brazilian users can set the taxpayer recognition number, mobile phone number, or email address as a user name in the PIX system, and then it can facilitate the transfer and payment between electronic wallets immediately. Roberto Campos Neito, the governor of the Brazilian central bank, said: ""The payment method is undergoing tremendous changes. Social needs to be fast, low -cost, safe, transparent and open.""  Today, PIX payment methods can be seen everywhere in Brazil's shops, restaurants, taxis and other consumer scenarios. According to the Brazilian central bank data, Pix has officially launched a year since the launch of the year, more than 110 million users have completed the transaction of 1.6 billion transactions. It has exceeded the sum of payment methods such as bank bills, bank transfers, and checks. It has become one of the main payment methods for Brazilians. It is reported that the Brazilian central bank also intends to provide international transaction options for PIX users.  The Brazilian digital banking industry has also developed rapidly. In December last year, the financial technology unicorn and Brazil digital bank Nubank was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company established in 2013, based on machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, conducts digital bank accounts, virtual credit cards, and personalized personal credit. Customers can use mobile phone applications to freeze credit cards, quota adjustments and other operations, and do not need to pay management fees and work costs. In the first nine months of 2021, Nubank achieved a $ 1.06 billion revenue, which was almost overwhelming from 2020. At present, the number of registered users has reached 48 million.  Hu An, the manager of Latin American regional manager of independent payment business operator, said that from sales to payment, the digital trend is irreversible. ""The epidemic has accelerated this process that has already begun to promote more consumers to start contacting digital payment methods.

The implementation of differentiated and differentiated prevention and control of partitional classification is a concrete manifestation of adhering to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". It is an effective measure to implement accurate prevention and control. It will provide strong support for the goal of achieving social Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  At present, the number of infected people in Shanghai's daily report is still high, the situation of the epidemic situation is still severe and complicated, and the prevention and control of epidemic conditions is at the most important stage. The more at this time, the more we must fully realize that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the best solution for Shanghai's anti-disease. On the one hand, the strains that are popular in Shanghai's epidemic are mainly Omikon BA.2, which is by no means a ""large influenza"". Compared with influenza, Omikon variants have a faster transmission, more hidden propagation, and it is more likely to cause large -scale transmission, and the pathogenicity is greater than influenza. If you are shaken on the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", once a large-scale infection will occur once the time window of the resistance is missed, the cost will be higher and the loss will be greater. On the other hand, in the short term, due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the lives and mass life of Shanghai will indeed be affected. However, in the long run, preventing the spread of the epidemic is in exchange for the larger and wider people's normal production and life. It is a more loose and stable economic and social development environment. Because of this, we must adhere to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" general policy of not hesitation and shake, firm confidence to meet the difficulties, clenched our teeth and continue to fight, and achieve the goal of Zero-Covid as soon as possible.  When the epidemic prevention and control, the more meticulous people's livelihood protection is. The more the livelihood protection is, the more effort and the more effective prevention and control work. It can be said that solving the trivial matter of people's livelihood, related to the overall situation of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", and the realization of the realization of the goal of Zero-Covid. Maintain the smooth and orderly production and life of the masses, do a good job of production and supply of necessities in life, and ensure the needs of the masses to seek medical treatment. This is not only a must-answer in resistance, but also an inevitable requirement for ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". To achieve the goal of Zero-Covid as soon as possible, we must do everything possible to strengthen the guarantee of living materials, continue to enrich the grass-roots prevention and control force, carefully do the work of the masses, and actively help solve problems.  Fighting the epidemic, confidence is more important than gold. Practice has repeatedly proved that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with my country's reality. It is the best choice to fight the epidemic, and it is scientific and effective. It is also necessary to see that although the number of infected people reported in Shanghai is high, according to the parameters of the index type growth of the popular strains of Omikon's mutant strains, there is no exponential rising trend, indicating that the prevention and control measures that have been taken to curb the control and control measures to curb the control and control measures to curb the control and control measures.

The epidemic is delayed, the virus variation increases, and the speed of transmission is accelerated, which has a serious threat to the safety of the people's lives and physical health, and has a profound impact on the development of the world economic development.  In the general debate of the 76th UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping solemnly proposed the global development initiative, calling on the international community to pay attention to the urgent issues facing developing countries, and jointly promote the new stage of global development towards a balanced and coordinated tolerance. The global development initiative will include resistance and vaccines in the eight major cooperation areas. In order to further condense the global anti -epidemic force, the key path is pointed out in the beautiful world of the post -epidemic era.  Promoting common development, the victory over the epidemic is the top priority  At present, some developing countries have returned to poverty due to epidemic and chaos, and many people in developed countries have fallen into life dilemma. Statistics show that the human development index has fallen for the first time in 30 years, and the world has increased more than 100 million poverty, and nearly 800 million people live in hunger. The people's livelihood fields such as medical and health are facing difficulties.  The struggle for resistance also had imbalances between the country and regions. According to data released by the WHO in January this year, some developed economies are promoting vaccines to strengthen needle vaccination, but the African continental vaccination rate is only 7%. Among the 194 member states of the WHO, 36 vaccination rates were still less than 10%, and less than 40%of 88 member states.  ""The international community should step up actions and resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic."" ""Do your best to prevent and control the epidemic. This is the most urgent task of fighting the epidemic."" In the ""cloud diplomacy"" of telephone and letters, President Xi Jinping's most talked about is to fight against the disease, because ""this is not only the basic requirement of adhering to the people's supremacy and life first, but also the basic prerequisite for stabilizing the economy.""  People's health is the foundation of the progress of social civilization. If the people's health level is low, if the masses will not be rescued in time, if the disease controls is poor and the infectious diseases will be popular, not only the people's living standards and quality will be significantly affected, but the society will pay a heavy price. President Xi Jinping listed resistance and vaccine as one of the eight major key cooperation areas of the global development initiative. It aims to strengthen cooperation through countries to jointly defeat the epidemic and crack the current global development dilemma.  Solidate the anti -epidemic and recovery economy, both hands must be grasped, both hands must be hard. Building a community of human health and health and building a community of global development, the two claims echo each other. It is the world expression of the Chinese concept of coordinating the prevention and control of epidemics and economic and social development. It is also a vivid portrayal of the community of human destiny when facing the challenge of the epidemic.  For more than two years, China has unswervingly promoted international cooperation in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and has unswervingly supported support for anti -epidemic in developing countries, especially developing countries. China has always regarded vaccines as global public products, promoting its fair and reasonable distribution, and ensuring the availability and burden of developing countries.  ""No matter what difficulties encounter, we must adhere to the people -centered development ideas, put the promotion of development and ensure people's livelihood in the prominent position of global macro policies, implement the UN 2030 Sustainable Development AD, and promote the cooperation of existing development cooperation mechanisms. Increase efficiency and promote global balanced development. ""  ""China will continue to hold a real multilateralist banner, adhere to the intersection with the world, communicate with the times, and make greater contributions to global development while achieving its own development.""  These China advocates direction for the world's major struggle for the world's victory and winning the fate of human future.  With the people as the center, jointly build a global immune barrier  ""We should adhere to the people -centered, improve the fairness, effectiveness, and inclusiveness of global development, and strive not to let any country fall behind.""  The core concept of the global development initiative is the people -centered. In the process of uniting the anti -epidemic situation of various countries, China has always adhered to ""people's supremacy, life first"", and injects ideological motivation into the global victory.  From joining hands to launch the “Belt and Road” vaccine partnership initiative to successfully host the COVID-19 vaccine international cooperation forum; from proposing the global vaccine cooperation initiative, to the ""COVID-19 vaccine implementation plan"" donation 100 million US dollars; starting with the ""Shield of the China ASEAN Health"" cooperation initiative, to the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Center ... China strives to make vaccines a public product used and affordable by people of all countries.  In Brazil, the COVID-19 vaccine in China was approved as a local 6 to 17-year-old children and adolescents in vaccination. The COVID-19 vaccine produced in cooperation was officially put into production in March, and it is planned to produce 1 million doses a month. In Serbia, the first Chinese vaccine factory in Europe will begin producing Chinese Chinese medicine COVID-19 vaccines during the year to help meet the country, the Bargan countries and the other European other European other European countries and other European other European National vaccine demand ...  The ""vaccine flights"" span the mountains and the sea, and the vaccine factories are put into operation. One item of Chinese technology benefits ordinary people, and writes vivid stories that fight for epidemic and promote development.  As of now, China has provided more than 2.1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Half of the global vaccines were ""made in China""; China first supported vaccine intellectual property exemptions, and the leading joint developing countries jointly jointly jointly jointly jointly developed joint countries. Production; China has or under construction in 15 countries or is building vaccine liquid irrigation bases, creating a local vaccine production center, and providing corresponding technical support to countries with vaccine cooperation.  ""China strives to provide vaccines to the world and make great contributions to the world's response."" UN Secretary -General Guterres said, ""The global development initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping, for promoting the achievement of the UN 2030 sustainable development goals and solving global development. Equality imbalance is of great significance. ""  Adhere to unity and combine work, build a community of human health and health  ""Countries around the world should strengthen international anti -epidemic cooperation, actively carry out drug research and development cooperation, build multiple anti -epidemic defense lines, accelerate the construction of human health and health communities"", ""accelerate the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, and build a community of global development of the destiny."" At the moment of multilateralism, China showed a firm will to defeat the epidemic in the time of overcome and to overcome the epidemic, and show a firm determination to promote the implementation of the global development initiative.

In some countries, tourist attractions not only use digital technology to put attractions or exhibits on the Internet, but also strengthen the digital construction of the scenic area itself. In the era of the epidemic, it provides tourists with richer interactive experience and intelligent services.  Egypt--  Let tourists get different previous experiences  Reporter Huang Peizhao  ""If you don't leave home, you can visit many attractions and monuments in Egypt, just like you are on the scene. This is what I didn't expect."" Ibrahim is an Egyptian travel enthusiast. Speaking of digital tourism, he told reporters that he told reporters that ""This is a completely different feeling.

""It is wonderful.""  In order to meet the spiritual and cultural needs of people during the prevention and control of the epidemic, the Ministry of Tourism Cultural Relics and the Science and Archaeological Research Institute jointly launched the ""Experience Egypt"" series of boutique cultural projects. Under this framework, dozens of museums and archeological sites in Egypt are included in the digital virtual tourism cloud space. The picture quality is high -definition, the image is lifelike, and it is equipped with graphic, video and audio introduction.  ""Experience Egypt at home"" cultural projects not only cover famous attractions such as the three pyramids of the Giza Highlands, the National Museum of Egypt, and the Copte Museum, but also some attractions that are usually relatively unprecedented and even in closing maintenance. ""This greatly expands people's travel scope and inspires people's interest. I have not visited some of them before. Now I finally make up for regrets and feel a lot of knowledge."" Ibrahim said.  Ibrahim also introduced that he had visited the stepped pyramid several times before, but did not understand many details of this oldest pyramid in Egyptian history. This time through the Internet, it seemed as if he took a vivid historical lesson. ""In the real scene, many details cannot be seen clearly. In addition, there are many tourists, and there are few opportunities to calm down to watch it alone.

The whole process is very helpful, which is very helpful to stimulate people's interest in history.  At present, there are still some shortcomings in digital tourism, such as the interaction of people and scenes to be improved. At the same time, some digital virtual cloud travel space pages require high network speed, and sometimes the phenomenon of stuttering or pages cannot be opened in some browser environments.  In Ibrahim's view, ""these are just inadequate in the United States and China, and they are flawless in any case. In the special situation of the epidemic, people are inconvenient to cross their homes."" Experience Egypt at home 'is a very good digital product that travels to Egypt.

As a famous historical and cultural city, the number of tourists from Florence at that time exceeded 4 million, which was 10 times that of its permanent population. Some popular attractions were often overloaded, which also prompted the city to go at the forefront of digital technology. For example, as early as 2016, the Florence Municipal Government cooperated with mobile operators to analyze the amount of mobile data, judge the number of tourists at different times and place, and propose a scientific and reasonable countermeasure.  In 2017, the Italian government's multiple departments jointly formulated a strategic plan for the tourism industry in the next five years to support tourism -related enterprises actively using digital technology.  Many art institutions have invested a digital tide to bring better experience to tourists. Uffizi Art Museum is one of the prestigious museums.

On April 10, the National Health and Health Commission's epidemic response work leading group team leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group leader group Liang Wannian, executive deputy dean of the School of Public Health and Health of Tsinghua University, said. What are the characteristics of Shanghai's this round of epidemic? Where is the difficulty of prevention and control? What is the significance of implementing ""dynamic Zero-Covid""? The reporter interviewed Liang Wannian in Shanghai.  Take more decisive and firm prevention and control measures  ""The strains that are popular in the Shanghai epidemic are mainly Omikon BA.2. The spread is very fast and the hidden nature is particularly strong, that is, the proportion of asymptomatic infections and mild cases is very high, which greatly increases the prevention and control of the epidemic. Difficulty. ""Liang Wannian said that most of the 16 districts in Shanghai are infected with infected people, and there are extensive community communication. Therefore, relying on the past epidemic prevention and control measures alone, it is difficult to quickly control the epidemic. Therefore, more decisive and firm measures must be taken.  Shanghai is an international metropolis of 25 million people, and domestic and international exchanges are extremely frequent. ""Shanghai must prevent the spread of the in -city epidemic and prevent overflowing to other provinces. It must also prevent overseas input and great pressure to prevent and control."" Liang Wannian believes that at present, the most important thing in Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control is to prevent the spread of the city and Bounce. Regardless of the measures to prevent and control such a large city, no matter what measures are taken, such as the test of full -staff nucleic acid testing, it is a huge test for the city's organizational ability and management ability.  ""Unified thoughts and firm confidence, unity can overcome the fierce epidemic."" Liang Wannian said that Shanghai must form an effective system to jointly prevent and control the epidemic situation from grassroots people to grass -roots organizations to grass -roots organizations.  ""While protecting the people's lives and health from virus infringement, it is necessary to ensure the basic production and life of the masses."" Liang Wannian believes that balancing the prevention and control of the epidemic and the basic life of the masses and the development of the people Topic. Therefore, the epidemic prevention and control must be faster, more accurate, and more effective.  The epidemic prevention and control strategy and measures in Shanghai are playing a role. Liang Wannian analyzed that although the number of infected people reported in Shanghai is at a high level, according to the parameters of the exponential growth of the popularity of Omikon's mutant strains, there is no exponential rising trend, indicating that the prevention and control measures adopted have curbed the prevention and control measures to curb the control of the control and control measures to curb the holdings The momentum of the rising index type. ""The Shanghai epidemic is in a critical period and a state of stalemate. If you do not advance, you will retreat. We must firmly grasp the window of this time. Everyone work together to defeat the epidemic.""  Put life and health first  The Omikon mutant strains are not ""large influenza"", and the harm is much greater than the flu. Liang Wannian believes that compared with flu, Omikon's mutant strains spread faster, and the propagation is stronger, which is more likely to cause large -scale spread. More importantly, the pathogenicity of Omikon mutation strains is significantly greater than influenza. From the global perspective, if the virus is popular, the general mortality rate of the Omicor Rong mutant strain is higher than the flu, especially the elderly people. The mortality rate is dozens of times higher than the normal flu.  ""From the perspective of public hygiene, the whole crowd is the susceptible crowd of Omikon's mutant strains. The number of elderly population in my country is huge, and the population of some big cities has a high rate of age. The crowd is a disaster. ""Liang Wannian said that the mutant strains of Omikon will continue to mutate. If it is mutated in a bad direction, it will be more harmful to human health. In addition, if a large -scale infection occurs, people will panic, causing medical resources to be crowded, so that normal medical needs cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the overall policy of taking ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" to Omikon's mutant strains is scientific and effective.  Liang Wannian said that in response to the mutant strains of Omikon, some countries adopted the ""lying flat"" strategy and let the virus infection have caused great harm to residents' lives, health and social production. my country's adherence to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the guidance of ""people first, life first""; on the other hand, my country has the ability and foundation. my country is generally ""clean"", the socialist system has strong organizational mobilization capabilities, the masses actively cooperate, coupled with rich anti-epidemic experience and various scientific tools, have the ability to realize ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  Liang Wannian believes that my country adheres to the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". It is done to maintain all efforts to maintain the health and life of the people. At the same time, everything may effectively and accurately balance the prevention and control of the epidemic, normal production, life, and economic and social development. In order to realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"", it is controlled by some people and inconvenient to their production and life. However, as long as the epidemic is quickly controlled, it can be exchanged for longer normal production and life, larger, or even normally normally production and life. Essence ""We must adhere to the general policy of‘ dynamic Zero-Covid ’, and obtain the maximum benefits at the minimum cost.""  The essence of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is fast and precise  ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is not zero tolerance and pursuing completely zero infection. Liang Wannian said that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is the general policy of my country's anti-anti-epidemic. Essence Practice has repeatedly proved that ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is in line with my country's reality and is also the best choice to fight against the epidemic. The core connotation of ""Dynamic Zero-Covid"" is that after the epidemic occurs, it can quickly discover it, and quickly block it, cut off the spread of communication, realize the discovery and extinguish together. Running in front of the virus spread.  Shanghai has the ability to ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Liang Wannian analyzed that as long as the infectious source controls, cut off the transmission pathway, and protect the susceptible population, you can realize the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"". Today, we have nucleic acid testing and antigen self -testing technology, and we have more powerful weapons and can recognize the infected person as soon as possible. Shanghai has abundant medical resources and support from all over the country to effectively treat and isolate the infected people and possible infecteders. In addition, as the vaccination is continuously advanced, the susceptible population will be further protected.  When will the Shanghai epidemic appear ""dynamic Zero-Covid""? Liang Wannian believes that this is based on the further implementation of prevention and control measures. At present, the city is conducting multiple rounds of nucleic acid detection and screening in the city. The purpose is to find out the source of the infection, to isolation and treatment, and the management of close contact, and cut off the transmission path. When all the source of infection is isolation and treatment, the newly added infected persons come from the monitor, and the social ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" is realized.  ""The high support of the Shanghai people's anti -epidemic measures moved us."" Liang Wannian said that in the investigation in Shanghai, whether it is seal control, control, nucleic acid testing, and antigen detection, the masses have actively cooperated and left him to leave him. deep impression. Liang Wannian said that Shanghai citizens must be firm in confidence, not panic, and not anxious. They must understand and believe in the party and government's anti -epidemic strategies and methods. Everyone should pay attention to protecting, protect your health, diet and sleep regularly. If the category and management of the prevention areas, control areas, and seal control areas in the future, those who have no positive infection in the prevention area for 14 days, residents can have a certain range of activities, but they must reduce unnecessary gathering and do personal protection at the same time.

""There are many ways to divide the meals in the door of the community in the shortest time, and then the cadres of the neighborhood committee are sent to the elderly's house to ensure that the elderly get the meal."" Essence  The beneficiary group of caring meals was originally an elderly person with inconvenience or long nursing risk assessment of more than 80 years of age. There were 178 previously. Considering that many elderly people during the prevention and control of the epidemic are affected, the Long March Town decided not to set up a threshold, stipulating that all elderly people who have difficulty in dining can apply to the neighborhood committee. Today, the daily delivery volume of love meals is 230 to 240 copies.  Qishan Village District, Jiangsu Road Street, Changning District, is a well -known new style of Shanghai.

Nanxin Fourth residential area has two residential communities, with more than 1,800 residents and more than 4,600 residents. The neighborhood committee and property staff were on average, and each person would serve 400 residents.  Rong Fengying, a 78 -year -old party member, stood out and took the lead in helping the outbreak prevention and control. Through the mask, the reporter can see the sweat on her face.

""I still told volunteers this morning, without you, I really can't support it, thank you too!"" He Xiumei explain.  Shanghai Kangcheng, located in Minhang District, is the largest semi -open community in Shanghai with 286 buildings and nearly 40,000 residents.

The news of Qiao Liang's sacrifice came, and his wife Zhang Cai and his son Qiao Junlong's phone call came. I haven't broken it, ""the condolences from colleagues and the masses""; Qiao Liang's ""neighborhood watch"" WeChat group was full of gratitude and reluctance ...  ""Seeing the police officer's figure, I feel at ease""  At 5:30 on February 4th, participate in the deployment meeting of the epidemic prevention and control security; 6:30, ride to the nucleic acid detection point of Xijingyuan; at 7 o'clock, maintain the nucleic acid screening order before busy; 9:30 am at 9:30 Due to excessive fatigue, the body reacts abnormally ... 19:47, and the medical staff died of all rescue.  This is the last moment of Qiao Liang's life.  ""It was very cold that morning, minus seven or eight degrees Celsius, Qiao Liang had not rest well before, and did not care about the work of being tired. When I arrived at Xijing Garden at 9:50, I saw that he was particularly tired and his face was not good. He hurried to the hospital. ""Wang Yu, an old colleague who got along with each other, clearly remembered the last sentence that Qiao Liang said before his life:"" It's okay, I can still stick to it. ""  Song Jiaqiang, deputy director of the Ruijing Police Station, said that since the COVID-19 epidemic, Qiao Liang both shouldered the mission of resistance, but also to protect the safety of Xijingyuan area and has been in a state of overload.

During the prevention and control of the epidemic, Qiao Liang always charge ahead. ""He has not fallen to maintain order, assist in screening, and work in all aspects; he has not delayed community fire prevention, anti -theft, and telecommunications fraud. Among them, colleague Xia Cun said.  ""I have worked in the front line of the community for many years, and Lao Qiao is very practical. During the prevention and control of the epidemic, there is no cooperation in the community in the community. The neighborhood committee will call Lao Qiao directly. Give me ', and then move the feelings and understand it until the work is done. ""Song Jiaqiang said.  ""With him, we are at ease.""

""He always pretend to be the masses, and rarely think about himself.""  ""Always assured the masses' things"", ""Only the masses, but you don't want to be yourself"" ... This is the evaluation of Qiao Liang, a colleague and the masses, and the true portrayal of the grass -roots policeman.  ""Qiao Liang, who has rooted the selfless dedication of the grassroots level, we have learned how to do the work of the masses, how to make ourselves truly integrate into the masses, and to be interested in the masses."" After Qiao Liang's sacrifice, he recalled his deeds, Rui Jing The police at the police station are uncomfortable.  ""He always pretend to be the masses, and he rarely thinks about himself.

The family promoted fire prevention knowledge and eliminated hidden safety hazards. Some residents are not at home during the day, and he will come to the door at night until everyone knows.  In response to the high incidence of telecommunications network fraud cases, Qiao Liang focused on preventing work. Lao Qiao, who has diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, often dragged his tired body and reminded him from home. He first distributed the common type of telecommunications network fraud into color printing leaflets, and then propagated to install anti -telecommunications fraud apps from house to house ...  The interests of the masses are small. He was extremely serious and responsible for the work of the masses, always taking the warmth of the masses in his heart, and never dared to slack the slightest. Qiao Liang handed over a flash of answers with affection and heart.  ""In the seemingly ordinary post, I have made extraordinary performance""  ""If you do a line, you have to love a line. He only has the love of work."" ""There is no fierce feat, but in the seemingly ordinary post, he has made extraordinary performance."" Many colleagues evaluated Qiao Liang.  In order to find the suspect, even if the hope was slim, he still squatted for a week on the place of the crime; in order to fight the picker, he held the horn every day and went to the streets to promote it. He ...  ""Qiao Liang loves the work of public security. As long as he is handed over to him, he can keep the quality and quantity, without any conditions, and never mention difficulties."" The case occurred. In order to protect the property of the masses, Qiao Liang simply settled the ""home"" in the market police room to facilitate patrolling in the market early. A person's power is not enough. He has formed a market order maintenance team composed of nine people. He holds a small horn every day to shout in the market to remind the masses to pay attention to prevention. ""After their efforts, the market picker cases in the market dropped sharply, and the local people read him well.""  ""Since I chose this job, I have to do it!"" Qiao Liang had no words, but he was angry. Under his influence, the patrol players were fighting for the first time. Once, in Wangzhuang Village, Beichen District, his patrol players arrested two thieves and were commended by the relevant departments.  In the event of difficulties, you encounter honor. ""Evaluate the excellence, he is humble and gives the honor to young people."" ""He is a good police officer recognized by the people. The love of the masses is the biggest honor."" Speaking of Qiao Liang, his comrades were a lot of emotions.  ""In the winter and spring of the anti -epidemic, the people's sentiment is not changed, and the people's name is not changed.""

Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health and Health Commission and deputy director of the Propaganda Department, said that at present, the number of new local diagnosis and asymptomatic infected people in the country has grown rapidly. Communities in some areas have not been blocked. The situation is severe and complicated. We must continue to adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" without hesitation and shake, fast words, and step up the promotion of key areas should be checked, received, should be separated, and should be treated.  From March 1st to April 5th, a total of 17,6455 local infected people in the country reported to 29 provinces. Lei Zhenglong, deputy director of the National Health and Health Commission's CDC and first -level inspector, said that the national epidemic situation is generally popular, large -scale epidemic, exudation with epidemic conditions, overflow cases, and repeated epidemics. Since mid -March, with the effective implementation of the prevention and control measures of various localities, among the five provinces and cities with more serious epidemic conditions, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, etc. have shown a good trend, but the Shanghai and Jilin epidemic are still in a state of development.  ""The prevention and control of the Shanghai epidemic is in a critical period. The state will continue to dispatch support forces from Shanghai as needed."" Mi Feng introduced that according to the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the National Health and Health Commission has transferred more than 38,000 medical staff from 15 provinces across the country from 15 provinces across the country. Human and daily capabilities of 2.38 million nucleic acid detection support Shanghai, carry out the treatment of nucleic acid testing and COVID-19 patients to help improve medical treatment and nucleic acid detection capabilities.  ""Effective control proof of multiple epidemics is proven, and measures that are strictly adopted by the core of isolation, control, seal control, screening, etc. Copy the clustering epidemic caused by the mutant strains of Omikon, which can achieve the 'dynamic Zero-Covid 'The established policy. ""Lei Zhenglong said that in the next step, the State Council’ s joint defense and control mechanism comprehensive group will continue to guide localities to improve the ability to respond to scale. After the epidemic occurs, seize the main contradictions, focus on key areas, and resolutely build the epidemic prevention and control barrier from obsession, from the morning, from the morning, and from the morning, from the morning, and the threshold.  At present, most of Chinese COVID-19 virus infections are mostly asymptomatic and mild. Wang Guiqiang, director of the Department of Infection of the First Hospital of Peking University, analyzed that asymptomatic infections include those who are infected during the incubation period, and symptoms or even diseases may develop. Light cases may develop diseases individually, especially those with older age, basic diseases, and non -vaccination people who have not been vaccinated or have not been vaccinated throughout the process. Therefore, when managing asymptomatic infections and light cases, medical staff must be present. In the square hospital hospital, medical staff and necessary diagnosis and treatment equipment must be arranged, including rescue equipment and basic medication.  At present, some places take control measures for high -risk communities. How to ensure the needs of special patients such as cardiovascular disease and cancer? Wang Guiqiang said that the prevention and control of the epidemic and basic medical treatment are very important. The problems of seeing a doctor in the controlled control area and the control zone should attract great attention. Especially in patients with severe critical patients, a series of means should be taken to ensure that these patients can get timely and effective timely and effective. Treatment. The State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism requires that medical institutions must have a corresponding emergency area or buffering ward area in emergency, rescue rooms, operating rooms, hospital wards, and obstetrics and gynecology to cure the severe patients before the nucleic acid test. All localities should count the basic bases for maternal women, dialysis crowds, and chemotherapy people, find out the bottom of the bottom, establish a ledger, and effectively track follow -up in order to treat them in time. For patients with chronic diseases who need long -term medication, the nearest medical institution should be arranged to give the corresponding drug prescriptions. It is recommended to extend the prescription to 12 weeks in combination with the disease and provide on -site drug delivery services. For the masses in the controlled control area and the control area, there must be health consultation and psychological consultation, including consulting and consultation of chronic diseases, give full play to the advantages of Internet diagnosis and treatment, and solve the daily needs of people to go home without leaving home.  Spring is blooming, will my country's epidemic prevention and control situation improve? Wu Zunyou, chief expert of the Popular disease of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, analyzed, depending on the implementation of my country's prevention and control strategy and the implementation of prevention and control measures. Affected by the world's fourth wave of epidemic, my country's ""external prevention input"" pressure is particularly high. We must adhere to the ""four early"" policies of the epidemic prevention and control, compact the responsibility of the Quartet, and implement prevention and control measures.

Recently, Sun Chunlan, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, rushed to Shanghai to investigate the prevention and control of the epidemic from Jilin. Essence  It should be seen that the main popular Omikon variants currently spread faster and more hidden. The number of asymptomatic infected people and the high proportion are the obvious characteristics of this round of epidemic. Show clinical symptoms. The more at this time, the more you can't take it lightly. From the perspective of asymptomatic infection, one is that although there is no symptom, it is also contagious; the other is that there are no symptoms today, and some patients may have symptoms in two or three days. From a global perspective, the popularity of Omikon's mutation strains has not been alleviated to the general harm of a country. my country is a large population country, a very small incidence or mortality, and multiplied by more than 1.4 billion population bases, the absolute number will be very large. Only by ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" can we eliminate hidden dangers of the epidemic, avoid the possibilities of medical resources caused by large-scale people infection, and prevent a large number of elderly people or those who have basic diseases. In response to the current epidemic situation in my country, striving for ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" in a short time is still the most economical and effective epidemic prevention and control strategy. We must adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic Zero-Covid"".  Persistence is victory, and persistence can victory. This is the profound revelation of my country's resistance and struggle to achieve major strategic achievements. Facing the recent characteristics of local local aggregate epidemics, there are many, wide, and frequent characteristics of the nationwide gathering epidemic. In particular, we must strengthen organizational leadership, maintain a sober mind, and resolutely overcome paralysis thoughts, mood, luck, and relaxed mentality. Grasp the work of the epidemic. my country's epidemic prevention and control experience has proved that relying on effective administrative measures and the positive cooperation of the masses, it can achieve the goal of precise prevention and control, dynamic ZERO-COVID. live. We must strengthen their confidence, take the lead in fast words, make various measures faster and more accurate, and implement more detailed implementation, speed up nucleic acid screening and risk personnel inspection and control, and step up to promote the inspection of key areas.

Community communication in the management and control area of ​​Jilin and Changchun City has not been blocked. It overflows to some provinces, and the number of recent infections will still increase. Recently, 90%of the newly added infected people from the country came from these two provinces and cities. The risks of spreading the spread of the epidemic community in Shenyang, Hebei, Tangshan, and Fujian in Liaoning are still high. The epidemic situation in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang is better. The overall epidemic in Guangdong is stable, but the pressure of external prevention input exists. In the past 5 days, the infected people in Beijing are from the control staff, and the epidemic is stable.  Wu Zunyou, chief expert of the Popular disease of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although Omikon BA.2 poison strains have a high proportion of asymptomatic infection, due to their fast transmission, a large number of infections will occur in a short period of time. By. By analyzing some foreign data, it can be seen that the number of deaths caused by the popularity of Omircor's poisonous strains is higher than the number of deaths caused by the same period during the popularity period during the popularity period. The popularity of Omikon strains is still very serious to a country or region. Wu Zunyou said that to achieve the ""dynamic Zero-Covid"" goal, the epidemic should be discovered earlier, and various prevention and control measures should be implemented faster.
