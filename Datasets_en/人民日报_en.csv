It requires various policies to coordinate and coordinate and accurately develop.  To implement the important requirements of ""the epidemic must prevent, the economy must be stabilized, and the development must be safe"", we must achieve adaptation of local conditions and precise policies.  Since the beginning of this year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, it has implemented the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council in all aspects. Recently, as the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control achieved staged results, parts of parts where the epidemic was seriously affected by the epidemic, and the production and resumption of production and re-production were promoting in an orderly manner. At present, the key node that determines the economic trend throughout the year must be seized and strives to promote the return of the economy to the normal track. All localities and departments should be guided by Xi Jinping's thoughts of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and in accordance with the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, it is difficult to forge ahead and promote the stable and healthy development of the economy and society.  Efficiently coordinating the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development. If you resume the labor one day earlier, you can recapture the losses a day to maximize the impact of epidemic situation on economic and social development. It should be seen that the resumption of labor and re -production is not as simple as personnel recall and machine restart. It also involves all aspects such as epidemic prevention and control, logistics support, safety production, and logistics. Enterprises need to do many aspects. Tension and reduction of orders. This shows that resume -and -re -production is a complex systematic project that requires coordination and accuracy of various policies. If there is a problem with any links, it may affect the entire process. Ensure that raw materials can be available, funds can be turned on, demandable and supportable, making resumers and re -production a sustainable process, making the economy move more better. It is a problem that must be resolved in the process of re -production and re -production. Therefore, promoting resumption of work and re -production, all regions and departments must not only ""support the horse"", but also help the enterprises to configure the equipment and personnel in place and operate as soon as possible. Reality problems help them return to the normal production level as soon as possible.  Supporting resumption of work and re -production, it is necessary to ""add"" fulcrum, kinetic energy, confidence, but also ""reduction"" points, taxes, and obstacles. Under the influence of the epidemic, the rent and fees of rent are stressful, the employment is still insufficient, and the corporate financing is difficult ... A series of problems can be blocked by the company's resumption of labor and re -production. Since the beginning of this year, my country's macro policies have gone forward, increasing their efforts steadily, from implementing new combined tax support policies, to issuing 23 measures to do their best to prevent and control the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development financial services, and then launch 33 to 33 A series of policies and measures to stabilize the economy, a series of policy portfolios points directly referring to various problems on the road of re -construction. For various places, we must not only increase implementation and truly benefit these good policies to the majority of market entities. It is also necessary to implement measures such as rents, fiscal discounts, and employment support according to the actual situation. The road is flatter.  Support resumption of work and production, not only the ""addition"" of the service, and the ""subtraction"" of approval. Under the influence of the epidemic, optimizing the business environment is especially important for enterprise development. Relevant departments should earnestly put the main body of the protection market in a critical position, and help the enterprises to find ways and solve problems. For example, under the premise of ensuring safety, we can create conditions as much as possible to simplify the resumption procedures, so that enterprises have less waiting time in terms of construction, employment, and logistics. , So that companies do not have to prove to work for a paper. The ""addition and subtraction method"" of such a business environment can allow enterprises to fully feel the warmth of the policy and enhance the confidence and confidence of faith and overcome difficulties.  Since the beginning of this year, due to the excellent expectations of the epidemic and international situation, the pressure of economic downturn has increased, and the complexity, severeness, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment have risen. Essence In this context, the importance of economic steady growth is more prominent and urgent. Effectively coordinating the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development cannot be ""cut"" and simplified. All localities and departments must realize that the important requirements of implementing ""the epidemic must be defended, the economy must be stabilized, and the development must be safe"", we must achieve adaptation of local conditions and precise policies. ; It is necessary to have the sense of responsibility of ""rest assured"", take responsibility for stabilizing the macroeconomic, accelerate the implementation of the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, actively introduce policies that are conducive to economic stability, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  Those who want to win together, and those who have the same storms. The more difficult moments, the more the departments of all regions and departments are needed to carry forward the spirit of the responsibility and struggle, and to help with the majority of the market, it is difficult to overcome the time.

Some experts point out that real data may be 5 to 10 times higher, because family testing is usually not included in official case statistics. The Washington Post commented that the United States may ""be in a silent case.""  Recently, COVID-19 virus infections and hospitalizations have surged in many places in the United States. According to the Wall Street Journal, the surge in confirmed cases is expanding to the northeast of the United States. From the central and western parts to Florida, it is facing the pressure of rising cases. US health officials and experts said that the number of cases in the southern summer is expected to increase, and the situation may be worse than the summer of 2021. Experts also warn that if the US Congress will not allocate billions of dollars as soon as possible, the United States will continue to occur in the United States that ""many unnecessary life losses.""  Michael Ostholm, director of the Research and Policy Center of the University of Minnesusida, said: ""You only need to look at the infected friends, colleagues and neighbors, you know how unusual people are now infected."" Previously, According to statistics from the National Broadcasting Corporation News Corporation and the ""World Real-time Statistical Data Website"", the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States has exceeded 1 million on May 12.  The New York Times wrote: ""Every deceased leaves countless mourners behind them. This losing chain reaction has swept many cities and towns."" Covid-19 died.

I have been looking for answers, trying to allow my family to get full information and make every effort to live.""  Data show that about 75%of the American death cases are people over 65 years old, and they account for only about 17%of their total population. Independence expert Claudia Maol, an independent expert on the right of the United Nations, pointed out that the number of deaths in the nursing home during the US epidemic was still seriously omitted. The Washington Post website said: ""We are losing our elders, not only because they are fragile groups, but also because of a more deep -rooted epidemic: (think) The life of the elderly is not worth cherishing.""

""The United States 'response to the epidemic is completely wrong."" American writer Peter Van Bulun said in the New York Post, ""Its failure part is attributed to the two parties' politics ... In developed countries, this has also exacerbated this situation. Equipment of income, high poverty, and obesity, diabetes, etc. have exacerbated our potential health problems. ""  John Broundstan, an epidemiologist at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States, said that the federal government lacked preparations, clear ideas, and political will in the early stage of the epidemic, and could not properly respond to the threat of the COVID-19 virus. Even now, there are still huge differences in the United States in resistance. ""Not only those safe and effective vaccines, but even wearing masks are still controversial.""  The Chairman of the Commonwealth Foundation David Bulu Menal pointed out: ""The failure of resistance is inseparable from the concept and political differences. It is said that some people are more likely to be affected by COVID-19, because they are ""almost no trust"" in medical service providers and refuse to accept epidemic prevention measures such as maintaining social distances, wearing masks and vaccination. This is a kind of disconnection. Some politicians in the United States ""pass the error message and destroy the suggestions of scientists, which will only exacerbate this disconnection.""  According to statistics from the Kaizawa Family Foundation, in the past 10 years, the expenditures used by the United States for state and local public health departments have decreased by 16%and 18%, respectively. In 2018, the per capita expenditure of the United States in terms of long -term nursing was 516 US dollars, less than half of other developed economies. Associate Professor of New York University, Selina Gg, said that due to insufficient manpower, some nursing homes in the United States failed to follow the relevant norms of epidemic prevention and control.  Director of the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases, the United States said that the United States should have responded to the country with the most popular preparations for the COVID-19, but it became one of the countries with the worst affected by the epidemic. ""This is an incredible tragedy, and many of them are avoided."" David Rosner, a professor at the School of Public Health of Columbia University in the United States, said: ""We have defeated the epidemic.""

The number of elderly people over 60 years of age covered 22.553 million people, and 21.76 million people were vaccinated throughout the process, accounting for 82.42%of the elderly population. Lei Zhenglong said that vaccination is an important means of prevention and control of the epidemic, which has obvious effects in preventing severe illnesses and death. The National Health and Health Commission encourages localities to further optimize the service model and provide more convenient and high -quality vaccination services.  ""Theoretically, infected with the Mutant of the Omikon Rongs, it will produce natural immunity, but it is not the choice we should make at present."" Wang Huaqing, chief expert of the China Centers for Immunization Planning, analyzed. As a result of severe disease and death, especially patients with chronic diseases and elderly people, the risk of this situation is greater. Secondly, since the application of COVID-19 vaccine, the effect of preventing severe illnesses and preventing death is very clear. In addition, Omikon variants were mutated, and the immunity generated infected was still great uncertainty. International studies have shown that the level of neutralized antibodies induced in the vaccine population in the vaccine population is lower than the vaccine vaccination in the vaccine population, and the protective effect of other mutant strain infection is limited.  How to do personal protection when receiving the courier? Zhang Liubo, chief expert of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested that you should buy related items from low -risk areas; when receiving express delivery, choose no contact method, make moderate protection, wear masks and gloves; the packaging of express delivery should not be brought into the room as much as possible. If you have to bring in, disinfection can be used for disinfection paper towels or disinfection agents; after handling the express, remember to wash your hands.  ""Disinfection is an effective measures and means to implement the ways of"" people, objects, and environment '""same defense and cutting off infectious disease dissemination, and play an important role in the prevention and control of the epidemic. Places and items are strictly disinfected. ""Lei Zhenglong said that during the organizational disinfection process of various places, it is necessary to strictly implement the disinfection technical specifications and processes. Support disinfection work and do a good job of standardized disinfection together.  ""Summer is coming. Students leave school and return to the countryside and cross -districts. They have great liquidity. They do a good job of preventing and controlling the summer epidemic in the summer. It is related to the health and safety of students, and it is related to the national epidemic prevention and control."" According to Liu Peijun, deputy director of the art department and the first -level inspector, the Ministry of Education currently takes the students to leave the school as a major work. The school returns to the countryside, supports the school's location, students return home, and various schools to do a practical work to do a good job of leaving the school and return home aspects to ensure that students ""leave the school in an orderly manner, travel safely, and get healthy.""",Epidemic prevention and control; prevent and control measures; vaccination; immune vaccination; mutant plants; ,True

After 33 days of continuous resistance, Beijing resolutely implemented the spirit of the important instructions of General Secretary Jinping on the prevention and control of the epidemic. Fast, strict, accurate, and real "", in order to quickly and prevent death, it is breaking through the state of"" stuck "". On May 25, at the press conference of the epidemic prevention and control held by Beijing, Zhong Dongbo, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Municipal Health and Health Commission, gave a judgment that the Beijing epidemic has entered the tackling stage.  This round of epidemic in Beijing was discovered on the afternoon of April 22 that a press conference was held at 11:30 that night to announce the epidemic. By 15:00 on May 25, there were 1642 cases of COVID-19 virus infections. Except for the peak of nearly 100 cases for 2 days, the rest always fluctuated up and down 50 cases, presenting a long platform period. This blocking war in Beijing is actually a prepared battle. So, why is there a fight for preparation so ""stuck""?  The city's anti -epidemic is already prepared  Containment and communication must fight for multiple seconds  ""The exchanges between big cities are very close, and the capital Beijing cannot fight without preparation!"" The reporter learned in the interview that starting from mid -April, Beijing has been in the state of preparations for anti -epidemic. At the end of March, the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee studied and approved the ""Implementation Plan for the Construction of the Public Health Emergency Management System in the Capital in 2022"", emphasizing that we must adhere to the bottom line of thinking, based on fighting, tough battles, comprehensively improving the emergency response ability of the epidemic, and the relevant emergency plan must be settled. The picture is settled, and the book is responsible.  The city held a meeting of epidemic prevention and video dispatching every day. Adhering to the city's overall planning and district self -fighting, from nucleic acid testing, centralized isolation facilities, mild compartment to medical treatment, etc., all have formulated special plans, and they have been fully prepared in advance. There is also a market confession. ""Beijing is a resource -input city. There are more than a dozen relevant provinces and cities involved in meat, and vegetables. The inside, the road, the ground, the ground, and all kinds of smooth and smooth protection solutions must be very specific and very detailed. ""The responsible comrades of the Municipal Commercial Commission told reporters.  However, once the epidemic appears, it is still fierce: the two spread chains quickly become three, and the epidemic has been hidden for a while. Beijing must fight in seconds, establish a 8 -hour work mechanism, and work uninterrupted in 24 hours. It is promoted to chase, control, flow, confidentiality, and transportation at the fastest speed. At 11:30 on April 22, a press conference was opened to announce the epidemic to the society.  ""Quiet, slow down, but not sealed."" Zhong Dongbo introduced that this is the leading group of Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work and the coordination mechanism for the joint control joint control and control of Beijing. Special circumstances, analyze the dissemination of the virus, and make a choice for the special status of the capital. ""It not only blocked the epidemic, but also left room for the operation of society."" Zhong Dongbo believes, ""From the global perspective, a large city with dense population and strong liquidity always controls a round of epidemic to about 50 cases per day without outbreaks. There is no outbreak. There is no precedent. From the current point of view, this combination of warfare is practical and effective. ""  The four -party responsibility ""Dead corner""  The epidemic rebounds ""no mercy""  Li Haiyang, who worked in a financial institution in Beijing CBD, said in an interview with a reporter: ""Everyone's psychological expectations seem to be about 21 days. This is a transmission cycle of everyone's cognition."" Then, why there is ""rushing and immortal"", ""dead ash repetitive re -ignition, re -ignition, re -ignition, re -ignition ""What about"" stuck ""?  Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the municipal government who has hosted a press conference for many days in a row, told reporters that in 33 days, the hope of ""zero society in the society"" has appeared many times, and even many days. It was close to zero, but the confrontation responsibility was ""dead ends"", and the epidemic rebounded ""no mercy.""  Some of the unclear units in Beijing's units are unclear, and the implementation of epidemic prevention measures is not strict; individual personnel deliberately concealed the itinerary and violated the isolation policy to the dense places ... Since the development of Beijing's this round of the epidemic, some units and individuals have not implemented because of the ""four -party responsibility"". He was repeatedly reported to account for accountability, and even was investigated by the public security organs for suspected illegal illegal. ""This also shows that our epidemic prevention and control still has a vulnerability shortcoming. The implementation of the"" Quartet Responsibility ""is not in place. The prevention and control measures are inadequate in terms of 'fast, strict, accurate, and real."" Zhong Dongbo said.  In the conventional China Railway Eleven Bureau and Three Companies, in the clustering epidemic, the person in charge of the construction team Liu Moumou and others concealed the construction schedule, unbuttoned the population of health treasures, and across the region in social for a long time, which led to the epidemic situation. Spreading. As of the report on May 21, 20 of the 25 people such as Liu Moumou had been diagnosed, resulting in at least 21 points were closed and more than 900 people were isolated. On the evening of May 24, the Beijing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection conducted a notification of investigation and accountability, and many leading cadres were held accountable. Liu Moumou and others were filed for investigation for suspected cases of preventing infectious diseases. Liu Moumou regrets the serious consequences of his behavior.  Coincidentally. The press conference on the prevention and control of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on May 25, which notified the new social screening case within 24 hours. Among them, there are still cases that do not comply with relevant epidemic prevention regulations. During home isolation, they will go to supermarkets, work units and other dense places.  Find the problem daily and block the loopholes in time. Since this round of epidemic, Beijing has successively issued a number of measures to make clear requirements for home office, internal personnel management of the unit, and personal performance of personal performers to ensure that they do not leave dead ends.  So as fast and strict and tight  Turking must be one heart  At present, the Beijing epidemic has entered the stage of tackling the tail -tailed stage, which is an inspiring judgment. How to understand the tackling tail? Zhong Dongbo analyzed from four aspects: the scope of the epidemic, the spread of the chain, the infected person, and the medical treatment:  First, the scope of epidemic situation has been significantly reduced. The peak period of this round of epidemics has affected 123 streets in 15 districts and economic development zones. After May 9th, the diffusion trend slows down. At least there are 9 streets in 4 districts. However, recently, the epidemic fluctuated due to the influence of the agglomeration epidemic of Yuezhuang wholesale market and Dongfang Square.  The second is that most of the branches of early spread chain have been cut off. The city's difficult situation from multiple lines and multi -line operations has gradually shifted to the stage of controlling sporadic distribution and focusing on local key epidemics.  Third, the proportion of infected people within the scope of control continues to increase. Although the number of new cases daily in the city is still fluctuating on the platform period, the proportion of infected people discovered in the centralized isolation point has increased from about 40%to 80%recently. There are still scattered cases in society.  Fourth, medical treatment has achieved greater than in. Of the total 1,642 infected people, 912 were cured. After the number of cases in the city reached 727 cases on May 10, the number of cases gradually declined, and the cases of cases were stable in cases in the hospital, and medical treatment was stable and orderly.  The press conference on May 25 introduced that Beijing will take the initiative to prevent and control the epidemic prevention and control of the epidemic, and realize the society as soon as possible with more resolute and decisive measures.  The next step in prevention and control measures mainly: First, it is to be fast and not to fall, and find a positive infection as soon as possible and block the spread chain. The second is to strictly manage to prevent risks from spilling. The third is to strictly strengthen the prevention and control of the social epidemic. The fourth is to continue to improve the ability to prevent and control the epidemic.  ""Home and office are also an important form of resistance. Today's home is for tomorrow's going out; today's temporary shutdown is to open up tomorrow."" Zhong Dongbo said, ""As long as we are in the heart, victory will come soon.""",epidemic prevention and control; clustering epidemic; Beijing; spread chain; personnel dense places; infected persons; press conferences; ,True

The century -old changes and the century epidemic are intertwined. Economic globalization has encountered reverse flow. The world has entered a new turbulent change period. Uncertainty rises. How to maintain strategic fixed force? How to seize strategic opportunities? At the two conferences of the country this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping brocked the ""five strategic favorable conditions"" that my country's development still had in China, which provided important compliances for us to do a good job of various tasks, and further enhanced our confidence and confidence in the new era of our hard work, the new era of work, strength. From now on, this edition has launched a series of review articles to discuss the profound connotation and practical significance of ""five strategic favorable conditions"" with readers.  —— editor  The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to control the complex situation at a high level, calmly cope with major risk challenges, and show the great historical initiative, huge political courage, and strong responsibility  Many districts in Shanghai have realized the society in the society, and Jilin has continued to consolidate the results of resistance. The epidemic situation in Henan, Jiangsu and other places has gradually stabilized ... Since March this year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the country has worked in the country. In concentric and side -by -side operations, we have adopted the most severe prevention and control test since Wuhan's defense war, and achieved staged results. Practice has proved that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. Our prevention and control policy can stand the historical test. Our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.  The Communist Party of China is the core force of leading our career. During the National Two Sessions of the country this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping stood at the height of the overall overall situation of the great rejuvenation strategy of the Chinese nation and the unrealistic change in the world. From the five aspects, ""the development of my country's development is still many strategic favorable conditions"", of which the ranking is row. The first place is ""the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, which has always taken the overall situation and coordinated all parties to provide fundamental political guarantees for calmly responding to various major risk challenges."" This important conclusion fully demonstrates the skillful ability of the Party Central Committee to respond to the risk challenges on the road, and deeply clarify the fundamental political guarantee of doing a good job in the work of the party and the country. The confidence and courage to overcome difficulties and move forward.  Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, these years have been extremely unusual and extraordinary in the development of the party and the country. The complexity and severe nature of the party's environment, the heavor of the task and the rare history of the world. In the face of the economic situation of ""three -phase superposition"", the strategic judgment must be ""adaptable to the new normal, grasp the new normal, and lead the new normal"", and guides the Chinese economy to perform danger and stabilize. The people's war, overall war, and hindrance war to prevent and control protect the safety of the people's lives and health to the greatest extent; in the face of adverse situations such as the deep decline of the world economy and the encounter of economic globalization, and make strategic decisions to build a new development pattern. This is Grasp the strategic layout of future development initiative and the pioneering chess, and clarify the choice of the path of economic modernization in China ... The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping is high -level to control the complex situation at a high level, calmly cope with major risk challenges, and shows the great historical initiative. , Huge political courage and strong responsibility.  However, it is more difficult to be brave; In the practice of co -ordination of two domestic and international overall situations, coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development, we have a deeper understanding that when the storms are coming, the Communist Party of China is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people; The strongest leadership core of the Chinese nation's revival journey. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the most fundamental reason for the party and the state's cause has achieved historic achievements and historic changes. Socialist ideological science guidance. Maintaining the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping's Party Central Committee, the core position of the entire party, and the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership are the fundamental political guarantees to promote the continuous development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. It is necessary to deeply understand the decisive significance of ""two establishment"", strengthen the ""four consciousness"", strengthen the ""four self -confidence"", and achieve ""two maintenance"" to ensure that the whole party has a strong political cohesion and self -confidence in the whole country. At the new journey, we brought together the majestic power of all the hearts and overcome.  Today, we are closer to at any time in history, more confidence and ability to achieve the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At the same time, I also soberly realized that the changes in the world, the changes of the times, and the changes of history are unfolding in an unprecedented way. There are still various risk challenges that can be predicted and unpredictable on the road. The more you face difficulties, the more you must be firm in confidence; the more you face challenges, the more you have to stimulate the fighting spirit. In the new journey, we must grasp the ""five strategic favorable conditions"". The first thing is to play the biggest advantage of the party's leadership. Without the Communist Party of China, there is no New China, there is no happy life of the Chinese people, and there is no great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. As long as we adhere to the party's comprehensive leadership, we will resolutely maintain the party's core and the authority of the Party Central Committee, give full play to the political advantages of the party's leadership, and implement the party's leadership to all aspects of the party and the country's fields, and we will definitely condense up To overcome the powerful forces of various risks and challenges, the giant wheel of China will definitely be able to cut waves and stabilize.  ""The safety is not aspirations, and the danger is easy."" When we were on the side of us, we must anchor the goal of struggle, grasp favorable conditions, and stimulate the confidence and motivation to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Decisions and reality should be made according to the objective reality and the needs of the masses.  Correctly judging the Chinese economy must have strategic fixed force and dialectical vision. We can truly grasp the laws and enhance confidence from the world's perspective of China, the local situation, and the moment from the future. The economic data released in April recently showed that due to the more complicated and severe international environment and the significant impact of the domestic epidemic impact, the downward pressure on the economy was further increased. But this influence is short -term and external. For a large -scale and many economies in China, short -term fluctuations are temporary. ""Sob"".  Based on the current and long -term, China's economic operation characteristics can be summarized as ""the shape is fluctuating and the momentum is still good."" To see, the ""shape of the shape"" of some data is concentrated in the short term. The epidemic impacts the economic operation. In April, some indicators fell and the growth rate slowed down. It is also necessary to realize that the ""potential"" of economic development mainly depends on long -term. Since the beginning of the year, the economic growth rate of 4.8%in the first quarter is at the forefront of major economies, while price increases are at a low level. In April, CPI rose 2.1%year -on -year, and increased by 0.4%month -on -month. Optimization, the total imports and exports of goods increased by 7.9%year -on -year; the employment of major groups was basically stable, and the population survey rate of population in April in April was 5.3%. In the long run, my country's economy is stable and good, and the fundamental fundamentals have not changed for a long time. The basic characteristics of sufficient economic potential, high toughness, strong vitality, large spins space, and many policy tools have not changed. With the performance of high -efficiency and overall epidemic prevention and control and the effectiveness of economic and social development, the national economy is expected to stabilize and recover.  In the case of short -term fluctuations, we see that new economic new momentum is growing rapidly. Although the industrial production slows down under the impact of the epidemic, the high -tech manufacturing industry has maintained a rapid growth. The value -added of the value of the industrial upgrade has not changed in April. The consumption and investment affected by the epidemic also showed positive factors. Basic lifestyle sales continued to increase. From January to April, the national online retail sales of 386.62 billion yuan, an increase of 3.3%year -on -year, infrastructure investment increased by 6.5%year -on -year, and manufacturing investment increased by 12.2 %, The investment of high -tech manufacturing and high -tech service industries increased by 25.9%and 13.2%, respectively, respectively, respectively, and sanitary and educational investment in the social field increased by 24.9%and 12.5%, respectively. It can be said that the general trend of my country's economic transformation and upgrading and high -quality development has not changed. It has stabilized the macroeconomic market and achieved many favorable conditions for the target of development expectations. Essence  Continue to maintain a long -term ""potential"", and we must also actively respond to the ""shape"" of short -term fluctuation adjustment to solve the real problems of short -term fluctuations. On the one hand, it is necessary to effectively control the key risks and keep the bottom line of no systemic risk. The problems reflected in some indicators in April should be attached great importance to the planning of incremental policy, so that the steady growth policies will be further effective. On the other hand, we must adhere to the stability of the word, seek progress in stability, efficiently coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the development of economic and social development, and implement the requirements of ""the epidemic should be defended, the economy must be stable, and the development must be safe."" With the phased results of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the re -production and resumption of production have been promoted in an orderly manner, the stable economic policy and measures continue to be effective, and some advance indicators such as the power consumption have changed, and the economic operation will soon return to the normal track. Put the steady growth in a more prominent position. Decisions and reality should be made according to the objective and actual and mass needs.  The wind knows the grass, and the fire seeks the real gold. The more facing the impact of super expectations, the more we need to maintain strategic determination, firm confidence in victory, and focus on their own business. All regions and departments should unify their ideas and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, take responsibility for stable macroeconomic economy, accelerate the implementation of the determined policies, actively launch policies that are conducive to economic stability, boost market expectations, ensure that economic operation is in the operation of economic operations in Reasonable interval.","market expectations of comprehensive, dialectical, and long -term view of economic operation; short -term fluctuations; stable growth; epidemic prevention and control; ",True

In the face of the characteristics of many domestic epidemic points, wide, and frequent frequent, we must not shake the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"", scientifically prevent and control and accurate policies. The ability to prevent control and control according to law, and provide a strong guarantee for the prevention and control of the epidemic.  Prevent and control according to law, cannot be separated from a sound and complete legal system. At present, my country has constructed a public health laws and regulations including the prevention and control of infectious disease prevention and control, emergency regulations for emergencies, and vaccine management laws. The legitimate rights and interests provide solid legal support. At the same time, according to the new situation and new situation, my country actively promotes the revision of relevant laws such as the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and further enhances the practical pertinence of the law.  ""The world's affairs are not difficult to legislate, but it is difficult to do it."" The law -abiding by the people is an important part of preventing and controlling and controlling in accordance with the law. At present, some violations of laws and regulations, do not cooperate with or even destroy epidemic prevention, have occurred, hindering the overall situation of epidemic prevention and control. There are very few confirmed cases that deliberately concealed the trajectory and history of contact, causing the spread of the epidemic to spread; some business venues have not performed body temperature testing, code scan registration, and environmental killing, which causes clustered infections. Disrupting the public order ... In this regard, the people's defense lines that need to build a group defense are needed to guide the people of the masses to enrich legal knowledge, strengthen the awareness of the rule of law, and support and cooperate with the epidemic prevention and control work.  Only by knowing the law. Improving the relevant legal knowledge reserves of the people is an important issue for preventing and controlling and controlling in accordance with the law. All regions and departments need to combine the propaganda of the rule of law in the emergence and daily epidemic prevention work, strengthen the propaganda of the prevention and control of the epidemic prevention, guide the public to actively cooperate with the prevention and control measures of relevant departments, and fulfill their legal obligations in accordance with the law. On the one hand, actively innovate and do a good job of popularizing legal knowledge in epidemic prevention and control. On the other hand, warning education is an important part of the law. For example, while increasing the law enforcement of various types of obstacles to the prevention and control of epidemics, it will timely publish typical cases of illegal crimes against the law from all walks of life, and play a role in warning crimes and education guidance.  Understanding the law also requires usage. During the prevention and control of the epidemic, it is necessary to better play the guidance of the rule of law and let the masses know which and which can not be done. For everyone, in the face of the epidemic, actively study and abide by the laws and regulations such as the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and cooperate and support the epidemic prevention work, which not only helps to protect their own life, health and legitimate rights and interests, but also add strength to the prevention and control of the epidemic. It is necessary to actively study the knowledge of law -related laws, strengthen the awareness of the rule of law, understand the law, understand the law, and consciously abide by the law of the law.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is related to the safety and health of hundreds of millions of people, and it is also a national action that everyone is responsible and involved.

Cases increase the uncertainty of the epidemic prevention and control. The leading group of Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work and the capital of the capital strictly entered Beijing Management joint prevention joint control and coordination mechanism to hold a meeting to emphasize that we must firmly win confidence, carry forward the spirit of continuous operations, and Vietnam. To achieve the goal of dynamic clearance, find problems and loopholes from new cases, and keep each line of defense, extinguish each hidden danger with faster, decisive and more resolute measures, and effectively block the epidemic spread chain. On May 21, Beijing introduced four more measures to further strengthen the prevention and control of social epidemics.  According to Xu Hejian, a spokesman for Beijing Municipal Government, the relevant measures mainly include:  The first is to fully implement the requirements of home office office in key areas. On the basis of Chaoyang District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, and Shunyi District, home office office is implemented, and other districts have further reduced their job rate and reduced personnel flow. If you really need to arrive, hold a negative proof of 48 hours of kernel acidic acid detection, and implement the ""point -to -point"" closed -loop management of the family unit.  The second is to adhere to non -necessary non -gathering. Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, Shunyi District, except for the guarantee of supermarkets, vegetable shops, catering institutions (only takeaway services), medical institutions, pharmacies and other normal business, all indoor culture and entertainment and all indoor culture and entertainment and entertainment and entertainment Sports and fitness places, offline training institutions, and shopping malls (except supermarkets, catering institutions, food stores) are suspended.  The third is to reduce personnel liquidity. Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, Fangshan District, and Shunyi District continue to implement the current bus subway operation adjustment measures. Other districts in other districts and control areas in the management and control zone shake or stop transportation, subway stations closed stations, rental, rental, rental Restricted regional operations. The city's level of scenic spots are suspended, and various parks are open at 30%.  The fourth is to strengthen epidemic prevention management in communities (villages) and public places. Strictly implement measures such as personnel, vehicle entry and exit management and temperature scanning code, and checking negative certificates such as kernel acid detection at 48 hours. All types of units and courtyards are implemented in accordance with the above policies. Residents in the city have reduced out of epidemic prevention requirements such as non -tie, not gathering, and strengthening personal protection.  Related measures are tentatively implemented from May 22 to May 28, and will be dynamically adjusted according to the epidemic situation.  ""At present, the situation in Beijing's prevention and control situation is extremely grim and complicated, but there are still some units and individuals who have implemented the"" Quartet Responsibilities "", and even intentionally violated the prevention and control policy and broke through the bottom line of the law. At the press conference of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work, Pan Xuhong, deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, notified many immune-related cases. Among them, in the gathering epidemic of the three companies of China Railway 11th Bureau, Liu Moumou (male, 64 years old) and others in the construction of a project of the three companies of China Railway 11th Bureau to conceal the construction itinerary and lift the pop -up window of health treasures to make this allow Risk -controlling personnel who are isolated and controlled should be activated for a long time and a large -scale cross -region. Of the 25 people such as Liu Moumou confirmed, at least 21 points were closed and more than 900 people were isolated.

At present, there is a clustered epidemic in Beijing, and there are still scattered cases in the society, and the city's epidemic prevention and control situation is still severe and complicated. In order to achieve the zero target of social clearing as soon as possible, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint prevention joint control coordination mechanism for research and decision to further adopt more and more stricter and more realistic measures to resolutely block epidemic transmission.  At the press conference of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 20th, Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government, notified. There are three main measures:  First, risk the epidemic risk of fast control. We will resolutely implement the emergency response mechanism of personnel -related personnel to ensure that the fastest and fastest will complete the judgment, tracking, transfer, and isolation of positive cases and deepenings. Accelerate the tackling. For key points in key areas, analyze and judge one by one, and concentrate the power of resource forces to clear the risks as soon as possible.  Secondly, the transmission of the epidemic strictly obstructs the epidemic.  Strictly control risk personnel. For those who have higher risks such as the same life, work, and meals, they should insist on making every judgment, depending on, and separating, and the Japanese and Qing dynasties.  Strictly control risk areas. Strictly delineate and manage the controlled area, insist on ""not leaving the house"", and sampling at the door. After the case of the seal -controlled area was not found for 3 days, the residents could organize the sampling in order in order under the premise of doing personal protection. In principle, the personnel of the management and control areas areolate at home. Each household can arrange 1 person per day. Under the premise of regulating the N95 mask and making personal protection, short -term households receive daily necessities, throw garbage, and strictly prevent the leakage of control. Further press the main responsibility of various units in the real -scale control area and the responsibility for the supervision and inspection of the territory, strictly implement the closed management measures, strengthen the closed -loop management and health monitoring of internal personnel, stop the food, strengthen the security personnel such as security, cleaning, property and other service guarantee personnel manage.

Fangshan District continues to strictly implement the unnecessary district, implement home office, and strengthen management and control zone management. Haidian District has further reduced the job rate and reduces personnel flow. After meeting the conditions for the termination of the control areas such as Chaoyang District, Shunyi District and other places, the measures and control measures are lifted in time, and public transportation is gradually liberalized, so that the unsolved prevention is unsolved. The city has continued to implement social prevention and control measures such as suspension of dangers and not returning to school for the time being.  Non -missed nucleic acid screening.

At the press conference of the Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 19th, Zhang Wei, deputy mayor of Shanghai, said that since mid-April, Shanghai has taken the principle of ""gradual progress and chain promotion"". Planning to promote the resumption of work and re -production of key enterprises. At present, the power supply, information communication, water supply and gas supply, refined oil supply, etc. The direct and stable operation of the production and life is directly related to production and life. In the first half of May, the city's industrial enterprises used the power consumption to recover to 80.5%of the level of the same period last year.  Recently, the single -day throughput of the Shanghai Port container reached 119,000 standard boxes, which resumed to 90 % of the normal level; Pudong Airport's cargo daily throughput exceeded 7,000 tons, restored to 70 % level; It reached 78,000 units a day, restored to 2/3 of the normal state.  Zhang Wei said that Shanghai will continue to adhere to the prevention and control of epidemic situations and economic and social development, which not only actively encourages the support of enterprises to restore operations, but also emphasizes that the rhythm of re -production and re -production must keep an eye on the overall situation of prevention. According to the overall situation of the epidemic prevention, Shanghai has formulated the overall arrangement of the restoration and re -production in stages. In the first stage of the end of May, the enterprise mainly adopted a closed -loop or semi -closed circular operation. From the second stage of starting in early June, according to the city's epidemic prevention and control situation, it will accelerate the advancement of resumption of work and re -production, and continue to expand the re -work of the enterprise.  Wu Jinsheng, director of the Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, said that this round of epidemic has a great impact on Shanghai enterprises, especially SMEs, and has great difficulties on enterprises' production and operation. We will increase assistance and further support the rescue of small and medium -sized enterprises.  Shanghai is promoting the recovery of urban public transportation systems step by step and steadily, and it is planned to gradually restore cross -regional public transportation from May 22. Among them, rail transit will first restore lines 3, 6, 10, and 16. The ground buses will give priority to 273 lines as the basic network covers all central urban areas, as well as the city's airports, railway stations, triathar hospitals and district central hospitals. The recovery of private cars and cruise taxis is being studied.  In order to strictly prevent the epidemic through the public transport system, Shanghai will gradually build a bus system with health travel and have fast emergency efforts. ""Places code"" and ""digital sentry"" are widely set up in stations, cars and other places. All passengers must hold 48 hours nucleic acid nucleic acid Provenal proof.  According to Zhao Dandan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission, according to the results of the ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening results, on May 18, Shanghai divided 3109 seal control areas, involving a population of about 710,000; There were about 2.36 million people; 56117 prevention areas involved about 20.22 million people.

It can carry out normalized nucleic acid testing in accordance with local epidemic prevention and control needs.  In various measures for the prevention and control of the epidemic, nucleic acid testing is a key effective means to quickly discover the source of infection and lock in control, and then take measures such as isolation. Especially in the process of responding to the epidemic of Omircor Rong's Omir Rong mutation in Jilin, Shanghai, and Beijing this year, the role of nucleic acid detection is even more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the prevention strategy centered on nucleic acid testing in order to better and more effectively cope with the epidemic.  At present, many cities and regions have successively explored the implementation of normalized nucleic acid testing, such as Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Dalian, Hefei, and many cities in Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province. Based on the local reality, these cities reasonably lay out nucleic acid sampling points, and the citizens organized the minimum 48 hours and the maximum 7 days for nucleic acid testing. In general, it was stable and achieved good results.  Normal nucleic acid testing is determined by the prevention and control needs of the local epidemic. It does not require all cities to establish a 15 -minute ""sampling circle"" for 15 minutes of walking, mainly focusing on the provincial capital cities and population cities with higher risks; All crowds are tested once every 48 hours. The specific test frequency is determined by the local area according to the development of the epidemic and the prevention and control needs of the local.  In order to ensure the accurate and reliable results of nucleic acid detection, the National Health and Health Commission mainly adopted the following measures:  The first is to strictly detect qualifications. Strengthen the management of genetic amplification inspection laboratory, conduct access to each laboratory to perform nucleic acid testing, strengthen the qualification assessment of technical personnel, continuously improve access registration, and ensure that institutions and personnel entering the entry to meet their qualification requirements. At present, there are about 13,000 laboratories with COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection qualifications, and 153,000 technicians who have obtained nucleic acid detection qualifications.  The second is to strictly detect quality control. While normalizing the quality control of the laboratory room, the State Health and Health Commission organizes the National Inspection Center to conduct room quality evaluation of the laboratory monthly. At present, more than 38,000 evaluations have been conducted on the laboratory. At the same time, in large -scale nucleic acid screening, the laboratory of each family who undertakes the test task dispatched quality supervisors to supervise and guide their testing work to ensure the quality of the test.  The third is to continuously optimize technical specifications. The two editions of the COVID-19 COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection technical operating procedures have been formulated to make specific regulations on the entire process of technical personnel, single mining, specimen mixed mining, specimen management, laboratory testing, and results reports. Innovate the detection technology of 5 -in -1, 10 -in -1, 20 -in -1 mixed mining technology, and has updated the implementation guidelines for nucleic acid screening organizations in the three editions.  The fourth is to focus on strengthening the supervision of third -party testing agencies. Formulate and implement the ""Interim Measures for the Management of the Medical Inspection Laboratory"" and ""Large-scale COVID-19 virus nucleic acid testing laboratory management measures (trial)"" and other documents, and regularly publish the list of institutions that have passed the acceptance. The laboratory of false test reports will increase supervision and deal with it in accordance with laws and regulations.

""There are still scattered cases in the current society, and the situation of the epidemic prevention and control is still severe.""  Recently, a newly added clustering epidemic in Beijing. As of 15:00 on the 19th, the Fangshan Branch of Beijing Institute of Technology in Yancun Town, Fangshan District has accumulated 11 cases and upgraded to a medium -risk area. After the epidemic, Fangshan District immediately launched a 8 -hour work mechanism to set up a joint disposal work with the Municipal Education Commission, the North Institute of Technology, the Municipal Health and Health Commission, the Municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cleaning, cafeteria food and other situations conducted comprehensive investigations, and the management and control of risk personnel were in place overnight. At present, except for the confirmed cases that have been transferred to a designated hospital, all other personnel are transferred to the centralized isolation point.  Since this round of epidemic, Beijing has conducted multiple regional nucleic acid screening, which has played an important role in blocking the spread of epidemic. On May 18th, the regional nucleic acid screening carried out in Beijing was sampled and tested a total of 21.47 million people, and the results were negative. In the special sampling window of pop -ups, 1 tube ten mixed and one positive. Experts from the Beijing Municipal Health Department introduced that the average incubation period of the Omikon virus is 3-4 days, so it determined that it was used as a round of continuous screening cycle for 3 days. However, there are certain differences in detoxification time of individual infections. In addition, the flow of personnel will increase the risk of spreading. With a single round of nucleic acid detection for 3 consecutive days, it cannot guarantee a hidden virus at one time. Therefore In order to block virus spread. Adhering to the combination of regional nucleic acid screening and normalized nucleic acid detection, Beijing is currently constantly optimizing the sampling time and point layout to ensure that the detection is full coverage.  In order to effectively do a good job of service guarantee for closure and control personnel, Beijing specialized in formulating the guidance of the work and control zone work, and sent to the front line of the community (village). In addition to reiterating the ""10+4"" management and control policies and resident protection measures, the guidance also puts forward clear requirements for residents' medical drugs and service guarantees. These include: community and community health service centers (stations) shall establish a docking mechanism with special medical institutions, arrange special personnel to collect the need to respond to the medical purchase of residents, through online diagnosis and treatment, medicine delivery, and contact with the medical treatment. Do a good job of medical treatment. The sealing and control zone shall set up a special service guarantee team and establish a temporary party branch to help personnel in the controlled control zone solve the demand for basic living security and medical service guarantee. In particular, it is necessary to focus on special groups such as old, weak, sick and disabled, and clarify that special personnel are responsible for doing well in demand collection, material purchasing, and home distribution.  At present, the city's community (village) in Beijing has fully upgraded various prevention and control measures. Each community (village) should strictly strictly check the stamps, strengthen the management of personnel and vehicles, and implement management measures such as temperature testing, checking the code, checking 48 -hour kernel acid test negative proof, registration and other management measures.",nucleic acid detection; full coverage; infected person; Beijing; epidemic prevention and control; ,True

Social screening still finds sporadic emitting cases. In the past few days, the main responsible comrades in Beijing have continued to dispose of the epidemic disposal and went deep into the front -line on -site inspection. On the 17th, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint prevention joint control coordination mechanism to hold a meeting to pointed out that from fast and strict and strict control and control deployment requirements, unswervingly promoted social dynamics and zero actions , Resolutely win the prevention and control of this epidemic.  The wholesale market in Yuezhuang District, Fengtai District is the top priority of the current epidemic disposal. As of 15:00 on the 18th, there were 78 cases of infected infected epidemic in the clustering epidemic. Beijing has relegated management and control of Fengtai District. The district is not necessary to leave the district and implement home office. Fengtai District has strictly inspected and controlled control, and concentrated power to carry out information on personnel information such as visiting, delivery, and purchasing; deployed more than 2,000 people, teachers, and volunteers in the deployment of more than 2,000 people in the area where temporary control measures were taken Many working groups such as medical treatment and purchase of medicines have carried out on -site distribution during the division and time period. At present, all relevant personnel have all implemented accurate control. Relevant risk points involve the Shinsen Land Market. All merchants and staff carried out rolling screening of ""nucleic acid+antigen"". On the 17th, 15,000 samples were collected, and the results were negative. As a ""vegetable basket"" in Beijing, the new hairland market has increased the harvesting and storage and transportation of supply. At present, the weighted average price of vegetables has fallen to the lowest since spring.  High -quality, full coverage to carry out regional nucleic acid screening and normalized nucleic acid testing are the most important means to discover hidden infection sources as soon as possible. On the 17th, the regional nucleic acid screening carried out on the 17th, a total of 20.74 million people were sampled. The press conference on the prevention and control of the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work held on the 18th revealed that the current analysis found that there have been no cases of nucleic acid screening in the near future, which not only delayed treatment but also caused the disease of the epidemic. sex. According to the relevant deployment, on May 19th, 20th, and 21st, Xicheng, Haidian, Fengtai, and Fangshan District 4, and street towns with positive cases in the past 7 days. Carnish normalized nucleic acid testing, and key industries and key groups continue to implement existing nucleic acid testing policies.  Recently, many Beijing seal control control areas have been unsealed. After the unblocking area of the controlled area, the personnel should be managed in accordance with the control area for 4 days; after the control area was unlocked, the personnel should carry out 4 days of health monitoring. On the 18th, the Beijing CDC issued three tips for the prevention and control of the epidemic after unblocking:  First, the community (village) should strictly strictly check the stamps, implement management measures such as coding registration, temperature testing code, checking 48 -hour kernel acid detection negative proof and other management measures to do a good job of follow -up management services.  The second is that residents should continue to do a good job of health monitoring, conduct nucleic acid testing as required, pay close attention to the health status of myself and members of the same residents, and measure the body temperature as required. 11 types of COVID-19 related symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and diarrhea should be reported to the community immediately and in accordance with the corresponding control measures, and do not purchase and take medicine by themselves.  Third, during the health monitoring, strictly implement the requirements of non -gathering, no meals, avoid unnecessary going out, do not go to dense places, and take public transportation less. It is recommended to work at home. Point -to -point closed loop management, maintain a safe social distance, standardize wearing masks, and do personal protection.  According to reports, from May 19, Beijing will adjust the inspection requirements of the nuclear acid certificate of commuters in Beijing and Tianjin. Each time commuters will hold 48 hours of kernel acid test negative certificates. This measure will be adjusted in time after the epidemic is stable.",核酸检测; 北京市; 管控措施; 聚集性疫情; 疫情防控;,True

It turns out that ""lying"" in some Western countries cannot eliminate epidemic prevention, and it will also cause people to healthy people around the world to be in a huge security risk, which will have a serious negative impact on the global anti -epidemic process and the restoration of economic and social order.  Recently, some countries in the United States and Europe have adopted a ""coexistence with the virus"" policy to retain only some basic epidemic prevention measures. From the perspective of related data, the vast majority of countries that adopt ""lying down"" epidemic prevention have paid a heavy price. The number of confirmed cases has increased again, and the rising cases of death are rising. The medical system is under tremendous pressure. Economic and social life is also facing many risks and challenges.  Multi -country epidemic has shown a rebound trend again  The United States has gradually relaxed the epidemic prevention measures since February this year, and the states have canceled the ""mask order"" one after another. Many states have begun to close the COVID-19 virus detection point, and the airline no longer require passengers to wear masks. Supplementary funds required for epidemic. However, this ""lying"" measure has not worked, and the epidemic has recently shown a rebound in the United States.  The latest statistics from the Global COVID-19 epidemic released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of the morning of May 18, Eastern time, there were more than 1 million COVID-19 death cases in the United States. According to statistics from the New York Times, as of the week of May 16, 95,000 newly confirmed cases were added in the United States, an increase of 57%in the past two weeks. Inpatients have risen by 26%in the past two weeks. Most counties in New York have become high-risk areas for COVID-19 virus transmission. Because the government has reduced the inspection and related subsidies of the COVID-19 virus, many people can only detect themselves at home. Experts believe that this has seriously underestimated the real diagnosis data of the United States.  The Fox News Network reported that with the rise in confirmed cases, the United States ""may usher in a surge in cases."" The New York Times reported that due to the high spread of communities and the rising number of patients in hospitals in the fifth wave of epidemic, New York City Health officials had to strongly recommend that citizens wearing medical masks in public indoor places such as office and stores, but There is still no mandatory request to do so. Earlier, New York City, as many cities in the United States, relaxed the ""mask order"".  France and Germany have recently canceled most of the prevention restrictions on epidemic prevention, and no longer forced the public to wear masks in most indoor places. From May 16th, France no longer requires the public to wear masks while taking public transport.  As of May 16, there were more than 147,000 death cases in France, and a total of more than 29.18 million cases had been confirmed, which was equivalent to one of each of the three French people infected with COVID-19 viruses. In the past 7 days, the average number of new confirmed cases in France in the past 7 days was about 23,000 cases, and it still operated high. According to the French BFMTV report, after the relaxation of epidemic prevention measures, the increase in the number of infected people, the number of hospitalizations, and death cases showed that the situation of the epidemic situation was still severe. The number of residents in France increased by 8%within 7 days of lifting, which brought tremendous pressure on the medical system.  After relaxation of epidemic prevention measures, German daily death cases quickly doubled. In early April, it broke through 600 cases per day, and still ranks the top five worldwide. Due to the spread of the epidemic, the 60 % hospital in Germany had to postpone the scheduled conventional surgery. As of the beginning of this month, the data of the German epidemic was still high, and the number of newly -added cases daily was still more than 100,000.  It brings harm to the health and economic development of the people  The British ""New Scientist"" magazine recently published a comment article stating that some countries are now giving up the goal of reducing COVID-19 virus transmission as much as possible, but there is evidence that ""the 'clear zero' policy is the best choice."" The author of the article and British writer Michael Marshall said that from reducing the disease's disease to promoting economic growth, the country that implements the ""clear zero"" policy ""does better on each indicator."" ""If more countries implement the 'clear zero' policy, human beings will be in a better situation.""  Marshall said that the most obvious benefit of the ""clear zero"" policy is that the number of diseases is greatly reduced. At the same time, the economic damage is also small. ""When the virus almost does not exist, people have the confidence to get out of the house, so that the economy can be fully opened."" He said that a study in 2021 found that compared Fast. In fact, ""lying"" epidemic prevention will only bring great harm to the economic and social, people's health, and global anti -epidemic cause of various countries. threaten"".  Michael Osthom, director of the Research and Policy Center of the University of Minnescea, said that the mutation of the COVID-19 virus is much faster and wider than expected. Maria Vankelkhofv, the leader of the WHO Emergency Project, said that the more cases of infection, the more the opportunities of the COVID-19 virus mutation.  The Washington Post reported that a new research report showed that the average life expectancy of the United States fell to 76.6 years. In the two years since the epidemic, the data decreased by 1.87 years and 0.39 years. At the same time, the epidemic has also caused a large number of ""epidemic orphan"" that lost their parents or mainly regarding the protection of people. The National Broadcasting Corporation reported that there are currently about 250,000 ""epidemic orphans"" in the United States, and ""a generation of children may face serious psychological disorders in the next few years.""  Data released by the US Department of Commerce recently showed that the US economy shrank 1.4%in the first quarter of 2022; data released by the French National Bureau of Statistics showed that the economic growth of France in the first three months of France was zero; It shows that the German economy in the first quarter of this year was only 0.2%month -on -month.  Experts call for strengthening the epidemic prevention and control  Multi -country experts have called for the epidemic to prevent epidemic prevention.  ""It is a mistake to relax all protection measures too quickly,"" said Eric Tonner, a researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, the University of Public Health, the University of Johns. "" significance"".  Anthony Fitch, director of the Institute of National Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said that the epidemic ""has not ended anyway"". The United States is still experiencing great popularity. It is out of reach, ""it is difficult to really get strong group immunity."" Fickna predicts that the United States may usher in a new wave of epidemic in this fall. The ""Washington Post"" polls show that only 34%of the people believe that the epidemic has been completely controlled. Most people think that it will take at least one year to fully return to normal life, and 20%of the people believe that they will never return to the past.  Virusologist Bruno Lina, a French Science Commission, said that France still faces the threat of rebounding by a new virus variant. ""We can't say that the epidemic is over, and the public health situation in France is still very fragile. The incidence of many places has been rising, and the medical sector is still facing huge challenges."" Lina said that the government and the public cannot relax the potential new varieties of the potential new varieties. Be wary, the corresponding epidemic prevention policies should be formulated and implemented in a timely manner.  Anto Velaht, director of the Institute of Global Health of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, pointed out that he should not easily abandon epidemic prevention restrictions and measures, and giving up means risks, especially for fragile people. He said that COVID-19 cannot be as such with influenza painting. Fluid cannot cause 100 to 300 people per day in France, and will not cause such a large number of patients to be treated in the intensive care unit for several consecutive months. In addition, the medical community currently lacks understanding of the sequelae of COVID-19, and it is unknown whether a more dangerous virus variant will occur in the future.  Claus Leinhart, chairman of the German Federal Physician Association, bluntly released the wrong signal to the society to relax prevention and control measures. Scholar Brockman, a scholar at the University of Berlin, said, ""In the past two years, countless studies have proven that epidemic prevention measures such as wearing masks can effectively curb the spread of epidemic."" German Health Minister Laitbach said that ""COVID-19 is not a flu."" At present, there have been signs that Omikon poison strains are still evolving, and the next wave of epidemic will be unexpected.  ""Think about it, if in early 2020, every country can adopt the"" clear zero ""policy, what will happen. It is not controversial that the number of global deaths will be much lower, and economic losses will be reduced ... the most ... The important thing is that the COVID-19 virus may not have the opportunity to evolve.

They were endless day and night, in order to quickly promote the virus to protect the life and health of patients. The reporter interviewed the medical transfer team of Shanghai Province and Tianjin.  On April 25, 50 negative pressure ambulances, 1 command vehicle and 190 medical personnel from 10 cities in Henan departed from Zhengzhou to Shanghai. ""The team has not stopped for a moment, and the party secretary and captain Ma Gaofeng, the party's general branch and captain of Henan Province, said that the transshipment team built the dispatch command platform on the highway.

Except for maternal, tumor patients, dialysis patients, there are many elderly people, most of them are 80 or 90 years old, and most of them have basic diseases. The whole process must be more careful.  During the transfer, the critical situation must be dealt with at any time. Li Mingjie transported a 95 -year -old man. The old man suddenly dropped blood oxygen on the ambulance and his complexion was pale. Li Mingjie decisively gave the patient a high flow of oxygen, and helped him suck phlegm.

With the gradual release of various policies and the gradual release of the policy effect, the normal economic order will be quickly restored, and the economic operation will soon return to the normal track.  A few days ago, the Chinese economy was released in April. Affected by the excellent expectations of the new round of epidemic and changes in the international situation, the new downward pressure on the economy has increased. How to view the current economic situation?  At the online press conference of the National Development and Reform Commission in May, the spokesman Meng Wei said: ""At present, the domestic epidemic rebound has been effectively disposed of, and the policy effects are gradually released by various policies. Fast recovery, economic operation will return to normal track quickly. ""  Steady growth-  Efficiently coordinate the epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market  In the face of the complexity, severe and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment, how can we make a stable growth? What are the actual tricks of employment? What are the favorable conditions for stable prices?  Persist in steady words, seeking progress steadily, and putting steady growth in a more prominent position. Effectively coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, and various measures are densely introduced.  Investment stabilizes, macro policies are advancing. From January to April, the National Development and Reform Commission approved and approved 38 fixed asset investment projects, with a total investment of 533.3 billion yuan. Among them, 8 fixed asset investment projects were approved in April, with a total investment of 18.8 billion yuan, which was mainly concentrated in informationization and energy. At present, the amount of local government bonds used in project construction in 2022 has all been issued. As of the end of April, about 1.4 trillion yuan of special bonds issued this year.  Smooth circulation to ensure that material transportation is connected. In response to problems such as cross -regional logistics and poor transportation and poor transportation in some areas, departments in various regions have combined punch: eliminate card points, strengthen the monitoring of the traffic of highways and ordinary national highways, and key material transportation. Public permit system. As of May 16, the traffic decline in the Yangtze River Delta has continued to narrow, and all toll stations and service areas in key areas involved were opened. Opening the blockage point, four production materials transit stations have been built in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, which played an important role in promoting key industries such as automobiles.  Cost reduction, effectively stimulate market vitality. Continuing the implementation of institutional tax reduction and fee reduction of institutional tax reductions such as manufacturing, small and micro enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households, improve the optimization of phased cost reduction policy arrangements, and levy small -scale taxpayers in the phased VAT; Removal tax refund, increase tax incentives for innovation of small and medium -sized enterprises in science and technology, and guide funds to flow more to key areas and weak links ...

""A spokesman said.  Stable employment-  The employment situation continues to be under pressure, and the four aspects are implemented to stabilize employment work in four aspects  Employment is the foundation of people's livelihood. Since March, affected by many domestic epidemic points, wide face, frequent excess, and more complicated and severe international situation, the difficulty of market entities has increased significantly, and some key groups have increased difficulty in job hunting. In April, the national urban investigation rate was 6.1%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, and the employment situation continued to undergo pressure.  In response to the severe situation and challenges of employment fields, recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly deployed research and employment issues. Many departments have issued relevant measures to do everything possible to stabilize existing employment and actively increase new employment. How to further increase the implementation of employment priority policies? The spokesman said that the implementation of various measures and employment measures, focusing on promoting four aspects.  Protecting market entities guarantee employment. Under the condition of preventing and controlling the epidemic, promote the re -production of enterprises. Accelerate the implementation of tax refund tax reductions and social insurance premiums, such as helping enterprises, and other policies for helping enterprises, promote the cost reduction work, and strengthen the precise support for manufacturing, contact services, small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households. The burden of the market entity helps them survive the difficulties and keep their posts.  Promote innovation and entrepreneurship. Clean up and cancel the unreasonable restrictions on employment and entrepreneurship, further enhance the leading role and service capabilities of the dual -innovation demonstration base, carry out in -depth entrepreneurship to drive employment demonstration operations, and enhance the service capabilities of dual -innovation platforms. Strengthen the construction of platforms such as returning home and entrepreneurship parks, and encourage returning home to start a business. Support multi -channel flexible employment, strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of workers in the new employment form, and continuously release innovative and entrepreneurial momentum.  Grasp the key groups to employment steadily. Implement the ""Notice on Further Doing a Better Employment and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship of College Graduates"", and encourage localities to introduce more support policies. In -depth promotion of the construction of a demonstration park for the integration of rural industries, vigorously develop the rural rich people's industries, and actively promote the use of work in the field of rural infrastructure construction to expand the local employment channels of farmers.  Talent training strengthens employment support. Deepen the integration of vocational education and education, school -enterprise cooperation, and continue to support the construction of vocational education quality and quality and education integration. Increase support for the construction of public training bases, promote the combination of production training at high quality, promote the co -construction and sharing of vocational skills training resources, and help carry out large -scale vocational skills training and training.  Steady prices--  There are sufficient supply of industrial and agricultural products and services, and make every effort to do a good job in the price of commodities.  Since the beginning of this year, international commodities have shocked at a high price, and major economies in the world have faced greater inflation pressure. In sharp comparison with other major economies, in April, my country ’s CPI rose 2.1%year -on -year. In the case of large input inflation pressure, it was not easy for my country's prices to maintain a stable and gentle rise.  ""Faced with the complex and severe external situation, my country coordinates the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development, accurately grasps the rhythm of macro policies, and continues to do important commodities to guarantee stable prices."" Spokesman said that various regions and departments have taken multiple measures to do with multiple measures to do with each other. Good insurance supply is stable. Since this year, my country's prices have been running in the overall reasonable range. In April, the core CPI of food and energy prices fell steadily, up 0.9%year -on -year, and the increase fell 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.  In general, the market supply capacity of my country's goods and services is relatively sufficient, and there are more favorable conditions to maintain stable prices.  Food prices are stable. Recently, international grain prices have risen, but the country has maintained overall stability. my country's grain production has stabilized more than 1.3 trillion kg of consecutive years, and the inventory is sufficient. Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said that the varieties of rice and wheat rations in my country and wheat have been greater than demand for many years, and a small amount of imports are mainly breeds. Corn and soybeans have a certain import volume, which will be affected by a certain degree of international markets, but the impact is limited. Since the beginning of this year, my country's food production situation has continued to turn well, and food prices have remained stable and have a good foundation.  Energy supply is guaranteed. The proportion of oil and natural gas in my country is relatively high, and the rise in international energy products will increase, which will increase import costs to a certain extent, bring input effects on some industries, and increase cost -promoting price increase pressure. However, we must see that my country's energy main body is coal, while my country's coal reserves are relatively abundant, and the production capacity is strong. With the gradual release of advanced coal production capacity, it is conducive to curbing the rise in energy prices. In April, my country's coal production increased by 10.7%year -on -year, and the price of coal mining and washing industry increased by 0.5 percentage points year -on -year. The spokesman said that the National Development and Reform Commission will use coal as a ""anchor"" to do a good job of energy guarantee stable prices, stabilize the electricity price by stabilizing the price of coal, and then stabilize the overall cost.  Most industrial consumer goods have sufficient supply. my country's industrial system is complete and has strong supporting capabilities. The production of major industrial products is at the forefront of the world, laying a solid foundation for product prices. The spokesman said that it will increase the supervision of the spot market with the relevant departments, and severely crack down on illegal acts such as fabricating the spread of prices, hoarding, and raising prices, especially malicious speculation in capital, and will resolutely crack down.  ""We will adhere to comprehensive policies, accurate regulation, and do our best to do a good job of stable prices for commodities."" The spokesman said that in the later period, my country has strong economic toughness, large market space, rich policy boxes, abundant industrial and agricultural products and services. It is completely conditional, capable, confident, and continue to keep the prices run smoothly.",Epidemic prevention and control; commodity; stable growth; normal track; investigation of unemployment rate; reduction of costs; small and micro enterprises; integration of production and education; integration of production and education; ,True

Realizing the zero of the society means that the community transmission that has blocked the epidemic is an important prerequisite for gradually unblocking and restoring normalization prevention and control.  According to the evaluation criteria of the zero of the society, the number of positive infections in the community, society (including management control areas, prevention zones, and social mobile personnel with non -closed -loop management, etc.) If you add a single day in three days to zero, you can think that the society is clear.  Since the outbreak of this round of epidemic, Shanghai has experienced a lot of difficulty: On April 4, the number of new positive infections in the city exceeded 10,000 for the first time; on April 13, the number of new positive infections in a single day reached 27605 cases; 4 On the 29th, no new cases were found during the first investigation of the risk crowd; on May 15, the number of newly positive infections in a single day fell to 1,000 cases for the first time.  In recent stages, Shanghai continued to carry out the ""antigen+nucleic acid"" combination screening based on the three zones. According to the screening results, on May 16, a total of 4057 seal control areas were divided, involving a population of about 860,000; 16,484 management and control areas, involving a population of about 3 million; 51,803 prevention zones, involving a population of about 19.44 million.  On May 17, Li Qiang, the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, pointed out when checking the epidemic prevention and control work in Fengxian District that the spirit of the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Jinping in the internship should be thoroughly implemented.

The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to deeply, complete, and comprehensively understand the policies and policies of the epidemic prevention and control of the Party Central Committee, and resolutely overcome problems such as insufficient awareness, insufficient preparations, and lack of work. , Resolutely overcome contempt, indifferent, self -righteous, etc., always maintain a sober mind, unwavering to adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"", and resolutely distort all the policies of the policies of our country's epidemic prevention policies.  At present, why can't my country relax the prevention and control of the epidemic? Once it is loose, what impact may it affect the health of the people? The reporter interviewed the experts of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism.  COVID-19 virus impact cannot be indifferent  Experts believe that the global epidemic is still high, the virus is still mutating, and the ultimate direction of the epidemic is still great uncertainty.  First of all, soberly understand the uncertainty of virus mutation. Ma Xiaochun, director of the Severe Medicine Division of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, said that the mutant strains of Omiko are more contagious and faster, and the number of infections is more. The impact of the new virus variation in the next is not clear.  ""Don't despise the mutant strain of Omikon. We found in the treatment of severe illnesses that compared with the previous virus, Omikon mutant strains last longer in some elderly patients with severe patients, and they will still show heavier lungs. The shadow of invasion has developed into oxygen disorder and respiratory failure. ""Ma Xiaochun said.  Second, we must soberly understand aging and insufficient medical resources. Tong Zhaohui, deputy dean of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and director of the Beijing Institute of Respiratory Diseases, believes that the current epidemic prevention and control cannot be loose. my country is a developing country with a large population. It is densely populated. There are many elderly people with the elderly with the elderly, especially the elderly. The other side is the total amount of medical resources, especially the insufficient medical resources, and uneven distribution. Once the epidemic prevention and control are relaxed, large-scale people are infected, causing medical resources to be crowded, causing a large number of severe illnesses and diseases, which not only affects COVID-19 treatment, but also affects other diseases.  ""From the perspective of our severe treatment, especially in some big cities, there are many elderly people over 80 years old, and most of them have high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease and other diseases. Covid-19 virus and influenza are different. Multiple systems and organs in the human body make the original diseases aggravate and lead to organ failure. This will be more difficult to treat. Even after treatment, the prognosis will be worse. ""Tong Zhaohui said.  Third, the protection of a sober understanding of key groups needs to be strengthened. Du Bin, deputy dean of the Beijing Union Hospital, said that at present, the rate of vaccination rates such as the elderly and other key groups is not high. All parties in the society should strengthen the science of vaccine to improve the protection of key groups.  Severe treatment achieved significant results  For more than two years, experts from the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism have participated in the treatment of patients in many places across the country and adopted a series of measures to summarize a set of effective experience and practices.  ""'Four episodes' is a very important experience that we do well in treatment."" Tong Zhaohui introduced that through centralized patients, concentrated experts, centralized resources, and centralized treatment, we can concentrate on patients with severe illnesses to high -level and strong designated hospitals. receive treatment. In order to improve the efficiency of treatment, a classification is also carried out within the designated hospital. For example, in addition to the general ward and intensive ward, a sub -intensive ward or a senior monitoring ward is also set up to categorize and apply patients with severity of different diseases.  ""We also promote the referral system between the city -level designated hospitals, district -level designated hospitals, and square cabin hospitals. The hospital expert group screened the potential high -risk groups every day, and transferred to patients who may develop into severe illnesses early. The hospital. ""Tong Zhaohui said that through measures such as"" four episodes "", one person and one strategy, and the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine, the diseased rate of COVID-19 severe patients was significantly reduced.  ""We hope to reduce severe cases through the mechanism of early screening of patients and move forward movement."" Du Bin said that expert experts from the State Council will go to designated hospitals to discuss the treatment of intensive treatment. It may develop patients with severe illnesses and provide treatment suggestions.  Ma Xiaochun said that in the process of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic, my country has always regarded severe medicine as an important discipline and incorporated it into the full management of patient treatment. Before some patients become severe, intensive medicine has been intervened to prevent severe transition from minor; after patients with severe illnesses, they will be treated with designated hospitals and professional severe teams with better hardware. It played a good role.  Always adhere to the people's supremacy, life first  Experts believe that our epidemic prevention and control policies and treatment measures reflect the concept of ""people's supremacy and life first"". Practice has proved that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. In history, our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.  ""The policies and strategies we adhere to the prevention and control of the prevention and control are in order to grasp early, grasp the small, and do our best to protect everyone, including the elderly and basic diseases. There are more serious illness and illness, and promoting economic and social development on the basis of ensuring the safety of people's lives and health. ""Ma Xiaochun said.  Du Bin recalled a severe treatment experience in personally participating. ""In order to cure a patient with severe illnesses, the National Health and Health Commission transferred me to rush to Kunming, Yunnan. This is a farmer who returned to Kunming after working abroad. It was quickly sent to the intensive care unit. In addition to the rescue of local experts, experts from Beijing and Guangdong also came to reinforcement. After comprehensive treatment, the patient finally turned to safety and was discharged from the hospital. ""Du Bin said.  Tong Zhaohui said that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, experts from the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism and medical staff across the country actively cured patients, even if the illness was severe and the treatment was difficult to give up. ""From the newborn babies to the hundreds of years old people, we all strive for each patient, which fully shows that our party represents the fundamental interests of the most vast people in China, and reflects the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.""",Epidemic prevention and control; designated hospitals; joint prevention joint control; policies and policies; ,True

At present, a total of more than 8.44 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed cases, and more than 30,000 death cases. Professor Hamada Taklang, a professor at Tokyo Medical University in Japan, stated that Japan will enter the seventh wave of epidemic peaks without the end of the sixth wave of the epidemic.  In mid-January this year, the Japanese government relaxed COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment standards and prevention and control measures. From March 21, Japan has lifted the control measures of epidemic affairs across the country, and local governments have successively relaxed the restrictions on the number of dinner people and held large -scale activities. Relaxing the prevention and control of the epidemic has led to the continued increase in diagnosis and death cases of home isolation. In mid -April, the average weekly confirmed cases in the weekly average diagnostic cases in the Iwa, Niigata, Kagoshima and other places were innovative. According to Japanese media reports, during the peak of the epidemic, medical institutions generally operated overload, and normal medical demand was affected, and national health was threatened.  According to data recently released by the Ministry of Health and Labor, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and the Ministry of Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Welfare showed that in the first quarter of this year, at least 555 COVID-19 patients in Japan died at home, of which nearly 70 % died during the quarantine after diagnosis. In the case of death, 89%of the elderly over 60 years old. Japan's ""Daily News"" reported that although some of these home isolation death cases were not asymptomatic, they died soon within 24 hours; some people were judged by the attending doctor without hospitalization, but they died within a few days. Many family members of the deceased expressed dissatisfaction with medical institutions in a timely manner.  According to Japan Economic News, the sequelae of the infection of the Omirjon strain are more obvious among the Japanese young age groups. The Pingji Clinic in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan has outpatient clinics that specialize in treating COVID-19 sequelae. After the clinic statistics on patients with the sequelae of Omircor's strain in the first quarter of this year, they found that patients 20 to 49 accounted for 77%of all 258 patients, of which patients aged 20 to 39 showed an upward trend. Patients with sequelae of the strain increased due to headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc., which were forced to suspend work from 40%to 50%before.  Kumana, the president of the Japanese Fuji, said in an interview with the Asahi Shimbun that the sixth wave of epidemic was completely different from the epidemic caused by Delta's strains. Elderly people will have inhaled pneumonia or cannot eat. People who have unhealthy kidneys and hearts will deteriorate the disease due to pneumonia symptoms. Luye Lang believes that this is by no means a simple flu. If measures are not taken to reduce virus transmission, the Japanese medical system will be unsustainable due to overload operation.

At the same time, stabilizing the macroeconomic market, strengthening and stable employment and employment will ensure the consumption capacity of residents. In addition, the promotion of consumption policies and effectiveness, my country's consumption recovery situation is expected to continue.  The monthly industrial growth rate has been increased from increasing, but the trend of industrial upgrading has not changed  In April, industrial production was affected by the epidemic. Due to the blocked traffic logistics, the industrial production declined, and the added value of industrial industries above designated size fell by 2.9%year -on -year. Among them, manufacturing fell 4.6%.  ""The decline in the growth rate of manufacturing is mainly affected by the equipment manufacturing industry such as automobiles.""

High -tech manufacturing has continued to grow. In April, the added value of high -tech manufacturing industry increased by 4%year -on -year, of which the electronic communication equipment manufacturing industry increased by 9.7%. ""The situation of industrial upgrading has not changed, which shows that the long -term trend of economic development has not changed."" Fu Linghui said.  From the perspective of the region, the impact of the epidemic in the central and western regions is relatively small, and industrial production has continued to grow. In April, the added value of industries above designated size in the central and western regions increased by 4.6%and 5.6%year -on -year.  “当前，工业生产确实面临一定压力，主要表现在市场需求不足、产销衔接水平下降、产业链供应链存在一些堵点、生产循环不畅、生产成本上升、营利能力下降。”付凌晖说， Despite difficulties, the characteristics of my country's industrial system and strong supporting capabilities have not changed. In the next stage, with the control of the epidemic, transportation and logistics gradually opened up, and the production cycle improvement, especially the continuous efforts of tax cuts, and the continuous efforts of helping enterprises' rescue policies will help boost corporate confidence, improve corporate operations, promote industrial production production Continuous recovery.

Since March, my country has adopted the most severe test of prevention and control since the Wuhan Defense War. Since mid -late April, the situation of the epidemic situation has generally declined. Some areas that are seriously affected by the epidemic, and the re -production and resumption of production are promoted in an orderly manner. At present, among more than 9,000 industrial enterprises above designated size in Shanghai, the proportion of re -work enterprises has accounted for nearly 50%. From the perspective of May since May, the continuous recovery of freight logistics, which was affected by the epidemic, has continued to recover, and some physical indicators such as the power generation of the country have also improved.

At the same time, all regions and departments implement the policy of promoting the steady growth of the industrial economy, vigorously promote the construction of major manufacturing investment projects, and implement the large -scale value -added tax retain deduction policy. From January to April, manufacturing investment increased by 12.2%year -on -year, faster than all investment growth.  Consumption is expected to gradually recover, and online consumption and upgrade consumption will still become an important support for consumption. Fu Linghui explained that from the two years of experience in the epidemic, once the epidemic was effectively controlled, the normal life order was restored, and the suppressed consumer demand would be quickly released. ""In the next stage, the efforts to stabilize the job and stabilize the job, and the overall stable employment of employment is conducive to ensuring residents' income and residents' consumption capabilities; some traditional contact consumption will accelerate the transfer to online, and the situation of residents' consumption upgrade will continue increase.""  Although exports are facing some pressure, there are still many favorable conditions for continuous growth. my country's industrial system is complete, the manufacturing capacity has strong supply capacity, can quickly adapt to changes in external demand, and unswervingly expand opening up, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with trade partners, and promote the construction of the free trade zone, which is conducive to expanding exports.

When the COVID-19 death cases in the United States reached one million, all circles in the United States recently expressed their grief in various ways. In the capital Washington Special Economic Zone, the National Cathedral sounded 1,000 bells in the twilight, lasting for 90 minutes. This bell is not only commemorating mourning, but also alert torture. The United States has the richest medical resources and medical care capabilities in the world, but has caused millions of people to die in COVID-19 within 27 months. The failure of the US anti-epidemic policy is enough to make people see the hypocrisy of American human rights.  Facing the century's epidemic, adhering to the people's supremacy, life first, and truly respecting every life is the greatest respect and best protection of human rights. However, American politicians inaction and chaos have led to the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the number of death cases in the world for a long time. The number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States is almost twice as many ass of the United States' deaths in the two World War, which is equivalent to the total population of San Jose, the tenth largest city in the United States. ""Every deceased left a pain for people."" ""Each number represents that we have lost a grandparents, a lover, or a person with their own unique stories."" American media pointed out. The ""national tragedy"" appeared will be ""always recorded in historical books.""  Looking back at the process of being reduced to the ""Failure of Echigraphy"", it can be clearly seen that American politicians adhere to political and private priority. In order to protect the interests of votes, American politicians deliberately dilute the risk of the epidemic. The so-called COVID-19 is a ""large influenza"", the mortality rate is ""very low"", and the epidemic will ""miraculously disappear"" and other remarks. From nucleic acid detection, wearing masks to maintaining social distance, from medical strategic reserves allocation, formulating emergency relief bills to promoting vaccination, the United States has always attacked each other, veto, confrontation. The overall situation of the epidemic was scrambled by the politics of all parties. The so -called human rights in some American politicians are just flowers and water in the mirror for the American people under the epidemic.  This is another important reason for the failure of public health and safety in public health and health and health. According to reports, the White House COVID-19 virus response working group and the National Security Council cooperated in February 2020 to prepare a memorandum memorandum, which is clearly recommended to take a series of strict control measures. However, the US government decision -making level immediately rejected the memorandum after learning that the relevant measures could lead to the collapse of the US stock market. In the eyes of some politicians in the United States, capital interests are much higher than that of the people's life and health, so that ""the elderly should take the initiative to sacrifice for the economy"" and other absurd remarks. The White House COVID-19 virus response working group, the coordinator of the working group, admitted in the new book that the United States could have greatly reduced the number of deaths through better leadership, but the facts were the opposite.  The people's life and health rights are unequal due to the differences in skin tone, age, and wealth. This is the truth of American human rights exposed in the epidemic. Studies in American universities show that the epidemic has led to the average expected life expectancy of African and Latin Americans in the United States and Latin America. The Associated Press reporter analyzed the data and found that among the million COVID-19 deceased, the elderly 65 and over accounted for about 3/4. The U.S. Poor Rights Organization issued a report stating that the overall mortality rate in the poverty -stricken counties in the United States is almost twice that of the rich county, and of the 300 counties with the highest mortality rate, the average 45%of the population lives below the poverty line. When answering the problem of obvious fairness in the prevention and control of the U.S. epidemic situation, then the US leader once said ""this is life"", which deeply reflects the ""social Darwinism"" gene deeply in the United States. Dabra Five -Holden, a epidemiologist in Michigan State University in the United States, bluntly stated that it is easy to accept the loss of the elderly and ethnic groups such as the elderly and ethnic minorities.  Human rights are not slogans, and protection of human rights should be reflected in specific actions. Recently, the number of new cases and the number of inpatient cases in the United States has reappeared for the increase in the number of inpatient cases. Faced with the still severe epidemic situation, if American politicians really care about human rights, they should seriously learn the painful lessons of the death of millions of life and effectively protect the people's life and health rights.",American people; death case; life health; average life expectancy; ,True

However, the choice of ""lying flat"" not only caused the medical resources of these countries to be crowded out, the medical system continued to undergo pressure, and large -scale infections also caused long -term and continuous negative effects on social and economic operations.  Since February this year, some European countries such as Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland have successively lifted the restrictions on the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, the virus is still mutating, the epidemic continues to spread, the cases and death cases of these countries have continued to rise, and some countries have reached the highest value since the epidemic. Many professionals criticized the ""lying"" policy and called on the government to be more patient and be careful to relieve relevant measures.  Relax prevention and control leads to dual climbing in infection and death cases  Britain began to implement the ""Coexistence with COVID-19 virus"" plan in late February, and the epidemic situation deteriorated sharply. The thorough ""lying"" policy led to the heavier British medical system. In April, the national hospital bed occupation rate reached 94%.  According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of the United Kingdom, in early April, the British COVID-19 virus infection rate continued to rise. In April, the number of people infected in the country in April exceeded 4.9 million, which continued to be at the highest level since the epidemic. COVID-19 deaths have increased for eight consecutive weeks. As of April 29, the number of deaths reached 1,247. Data show that as of late April, 90 % of the people in England had infected at least once infected with COVID-19 viruses, of which more than half were infected after the popular Omircodon strain.  Denmark and Sweden announced on February 1st and 9th, respectively, and announced the cancellation of all epidemic restrictions, including taking public transportation and no need to wear masks. After the Norwegian government announced on February 1, it was further canceled and maintained on the 12th. Social distance, self -isolation and other restrictions; on February 25, Iceland announced a comprehensive cancellation of epidemic prevention measures.  However, the lifting of epidemic prevention measures has led to a severe rebound in the Northern European countries, and new hospitalization cases and death cases have quickly set the highest record since the outbreak of the epidemic. At present, it is still significantly higher than the peak of the epidemic caused by the Delta strain last year.  Sweden's cumulative confirmed cases of diagnosis have reached 2%, which is equivalent to one of more than 500 people died of COVID-19, which is much higher than the average level of 1.24%worldwide. Since it was announced on February 9th, an average of 193.5 people died of COVID-19 per week.  In just ten days after Denmark fully liberalized the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of cases and death cases rose straight. On February 13th, 7,970 people were diagnosed with a new high of 7,970 people, exceeding the record of December 2020; 4.92 deaths per day per 1 million people were much higher than the previous record.  Data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health showed that two days before the announcement of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of newly confirmed cases in the country was 26,109 and 25086, respectively, setting the highest record.  After a comprehensive lifting of epidemic prevention measures, Iceland once reached 4,300 cases, setting a new high number of new confirmed cases in a single day. The largest hospital in Iceland has also announced an emergency state to respond to the surge in the admission of COVID-19 viruses and the number of severe persons.  The long -term economic and social consequences cannot be underestimated  After choosing a thorough ""lying"", the rapidly increasing COVID-19 patients poured into the hospital to allow the medical system to operate overload; due to the infection of COVID-19, a large number of absences and related sequelae are caused Not to be underestimated.  COVID-19 patients and medical staff who asked for leave due to infection viruses surged, which led to the difficulty of running the British medical system and frequent crises. The British ""Financial Times"" analyzed that in April, the number of empty beds in Hospital in England fell to the lowest since the epidemic, with only 5.4%of beds. There are 200,000 absence medical staff of the British national health service system every week. At present, 6.2 million patients in the England region alone are on non -emergency treatment lists.  According to statistics, 1.7 million people in Britain have ""COVID-19 long-term symptoms"", of which 2/3 of them are affected by daily life, and 1/5 people have a serious limitation of activity capabilities, which will bring long-term pressure on the British medical system Essence According to statistics, since the announcement of the ""lying"" policy, British hospitals, schools, and enterprises have generally reported that about 1/10 employees are absent from their diligence due to the infection of the COVID-19 virus. Operation.  The British media recently quoted a survey that the 1/4 British company said that the COVID-19 epidemic was the main reason for the shortage of corporate employees. The report from the Tony Blair Global Change of Tony Blair showed that the reduction of labor force and sequelae caused by the infection of the COVID-19 virus will lead to a decline in social productivity, and it is expected that the British economy will shrink by about 1%.  The latest data released by Sweden shows that more than 640,000 Swedish are waiting in line to be treated. Among them, more than 200,000 people waited more than statutory time. Swedish Minister of Health Lina Haren Galen said: ""The epidemic has brought historical pressure to the Swedish medical care system. Many nursing services have to be postponed and the staff can bear great pressure."" Data from the Swedish Bureau of Statistics show that recently, The number of absence employees related to the COVID-19 epidemic reached 140,000, and the number of absences continued to increase, which caused continuous negative impact on the economy and society.  In Denmark, although 62%of residents have vaccinated the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, after choosing to ""lie down"" completely, COVID-19 severe patients have increased significantly. The Danish medical system was forced to postpone all non-emergency surgery in order to treat patients with COVID-19 priority.  Camilla Stoltenberg, director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said: ""In the past week, the number of people infected with COVID-19 has increased by 40%, which has caused tremendous pressure on the intensive care unit.""  Sorcelo Gednerson, the chief epidemiologist of Iceland, recently acknowledged that in the first quarter of this year, the number of deaths related to COVID-19 far exceeded expectations. In 2020 and 2021, due to strict implementation of epidemic prevention measures, the mortality rate for the elderly over the age of 70 in Iceland has remained at a lower level.  Professionals call for caution to relieve epidemic prevention measures  Many professionals have criticized ""lying down"" completely. The British ""Nature"" magazine published a research report in March this year, criticizing the Swedish government to respond to the ""very bad"" response to the epidemic, and the group's immunity was ""unable to achieve"". The report pointed out: ""Sweden's response to the COVID-19 epidemic is unique, and its characteristics are that they are too free in morality, ethics and science.""  Earlier, more than 2,000 people in the British scientific community issued a joint public letter asking the government to restart epidemic prevention measures. British Prime Minister Johnson also said that he does not rule out the possibility of ""sealed the city"" again due to the epidemic.  Frend Furland, an expert at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, believes that it is very dangerous to expect to disseminate virus transmission to achieve group immunity. Elg, a professor at the University of Merio at the University of Merio, said that the epidemic is still a major threat to Swedish society. The government should be more patient and should not be urgent to relieve epidemic prevention measures.  ""British Medical Magazine"" recently commented that lolicizing epidemic prevention measures is to ""restore normal order"", but it is ironic that this policy has triggered a larger chaos. With the complete lifting of the epidemic prevention and control measures, the tracking volume and large-scale free detection volume of close contacts decreased, and the COVID-19 virus infection rate has soared significantly. Increased patient employees have caused serious hindrance to all aspects of social life. ""  Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds University in Britain, believes that, instead of ""coexisting"" with COVID-19 viruses, Britain is ""coexisting"" as COVID-19 viruses. ""Abandoning measures such as large -scale detection and infection isolation, we will never achieve the level of low infection. The antibodies produced by the vaccine continue to weaken with time. Infection, the covid-19 epidemic is still a major challenge for public health. ""  (Our newspaper London, Stockholm Electric)",Public health; epidemic prevention measures; ,True

The current situation of the capital epidemic is severe and complicated. Social screening found that there are still cases of concealment, bringing uncertainty to the prevention and control of the capital epidemic. Beijing further refined the ""four -party responsibility"" and grasped the ""last 100 meters"" in practice.  Return to the time, and the case is covered as soon as possible. Beginning on May 13th, Beijing used the weekend window period to carry out nucleic acid screening on 12 areas for 3 consecutive days. The majority of Beijing citizens actively responded to the call of home office, participating in nucleic acid testing in an orderly manner, and standardized wearing masks and maintaining two meters of line interval. As of now, there are 9694 sampling points and 22,447 sample tables in 12 regions in Beijing, and the testing work is tight and orderly.  The sieve tube is used together to resolutely prevent the leakage of the pipe from control. Today, Haidian District announced that a nucleic acid testing positive personnel are bus flight attendant administrators of bus stations, which has attracted attention. The results of this employee's multiple nucleic acid detection results from April 25th to May 10th were negative, and the test results of nucleic acid detection in social screening on May 11 were positive. According to reports, Haidian District and Bus Group announced relevant information to the society overnight, and quickly arranged the situation of drivers, flight attendants and other personnel who entered the stations since May 5th. So far 14 people. Relevant departments conduct nucleic acid testing on relevant personnel and environment, and conduct multiple rounds of disinfection work on all operating vehicles in the station to ensure that the operation work is safe and orderly.

How to view the current economic situation in China? How to ensure that economic operations remain in a reasonable range? The reporter interviewed Sheng Laiyun, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the National Bureau of Statistics.  Stable expectations, we must ""solidify the root, stabilize policies, relieve difficulties, and activation""  Reporter: The just -released April Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) and non -manufacturing business activities index are declining. What do you think of the expected problem of market players?  Shenglaiyun: Weakness is expected to be a relatively prominent problem in the current economic operation. In April, the manufacturing PMI and non -manufacturing business activities index fell to 47.4%and 41.9%, and the situation of the weakening of enterprises was relatively obvious. Weakening market expectations is the result of the intersection of internal and external factors and the common impact of long -term factors.  From the perspective of external factors, the world economy has shifted to high inflation, high interest rates, high debt, high cost, and low -growth category ""stagflation"" high -risk models, and unstable uncertain factors increase. At the same time, there are many geopolitical incidents such as the Ukraine crisis, and public health incidents have frequently occurred. The policy of turning in major economies has accelerated, which has a great impact on global economic operations and capital flows.  From the perspective of internal factors, the pain of economic transformation is still continuing, the conversion of new and old kinetic energy is not smooth, coupled with the impact of the epidemic, the market demand is insufficient, the production logistics costs are not good, the production costs of enterprises have risen significantly. Increase. These have a significant impact on market confidence and corporate expectations.  Reporter: How to reverse the situation of weakening expectations?  Shenglaiyun: Stable expectations must be multi -pronged, long -term combination, symptomatic medicine, and long -term contribution, especially ""solidifying fundamentals, stabilizing policies, relieving difficulties, and activation.""  ""Fundamental"" is to focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic market. Strengthen macro -control, quickly plan the incremental policy tools, solidly stabilize the economy, and strive to achieve the main expected goals of economic and social development throughout the year. ""Stability policy"" is to maintain the continuity of the policy. The more difficult it is, the more you need to maintain a certain force to pass clear and stable policy signals to the market, which will help market players planning early, early decision -making, and early action. ""Difficulty"" is to increase the assistance of market entities and difficult groups in difficulties, and to implement a package of rescue measures early and implement a package of bailout measures early. ""Activity"" is to unswervingly promote reform and innovation, promote the reform of ""decentralization of management"", create a better development environment for enterprises, and allow enterprises to enjoy more reform dividends.  The economic growth rate has slowed down, but the direction of high -quality development has not changed  Reporter: Recently, the epidemic is more distributed. How do you evaluate the impact of the current epidemic on the Chinese economy?  Shenglaiyun: This round of epidemic really has a huge impact on the Chinese economy. In March, the total retail sales of consumer goods in the country, the production index of the service industry from increasing to decline, the production and logistics were blocked, the volume of freight in the whole society fell by 2.2%, and the number of courier business decreased by 3.1%. The value added of industries above designated size in Shanghai and Jilin decreased by 10.9%and 36.7%year -on -year, and the retail sales of consumer goods above the limit decreased by 18.2%and 69.9%, respectively.  Although the epidemic has a great impact on the production and life of some areas, in general, it is staged, short -term, and external. As the policy effects of high -efficiency overall preparations and economic and social development have gradually emerged, the impact of the epidemic is expected to gradually weaken. Economic activities that are suppressed in the early stage will continue to be released. The economy is expected to usher in the inflection point of recovery. Judging from the situation in May, the epidemic in Jilin, Shanghai and other places has been effectively controlled, the re -production and re -production are promoted in an orderly manner, and some advance indicators such as the power consumption have changed positive changes.  Observing China's economic operation, we must look at and dialectically. We must not only see the ""shape"" of short -term fluctuations, but also the ""potential"" of long -term development. In the short term, some indicators fell more, mainly the result of the impact of the epidemic. From the perspective of the overall situation, the economic stable development and long -term good fundamentals have not changed, especially the general trend of structural adjustment and transformation and upgrading and high -quality development. In March, the value -added value of high -tech manufacturing above designated size increased by 13.8%year -on -year, and the production index of information transmission, software and information technology service industry increased by 12.8%, and new economic momentum was still growing rapidly. This shows that although the economic growth has slowed down, the direction of high -quality development has not changed. It can be said that ""the shape is fluctuating and the momentum is still good."" The giant wheel of the Chinese economy is splitting waves on the right route.  Multiple measures and implementation to ensure that the economic operation is maintained in a reasonable range  Reporter: How to view the economic trend of the year?  Shenglaiyun: From the perspective of the whole year, although many difficulties and challenges may be faced, the basic characteristics of my country's economy are stable and good, and long -term good fundamentals have not changed. Change, stabilize the macroeconomic market, and achieve more favorable conditions for the development of development expectations.  From the perspective of supply support, my country's social productivity level has continued to increase, and the total grain output has stabilized more than 1.3 trillion kg for 7 consecutive years. The value -added of manufacturing has ranked first in the world for 12 consecutive years, and the industrial chain supply chain is strong. From the perspective of demand support, my country has a population of 1.41 billion and has the most growing domestic market in the world. From the perspective of policy support, my country's government has low deficit rates, overall debt is controllable, and has many policy tools. At present, macro policies are continuously increasing. Increasing policy tools are planning to plan, and the stabilization of growth policies is expected to further show its efforts.  More importantly, we have the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the significant advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, a good situation of long -term harmony and stability in society, and rich experience in macro -control and social governance. Therefore, as long as we are all attentive and overcome difficulties, we will unswervingly implement the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, and we will be able to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  Reporter: How can macro policies be used for employment, stabilizing prices, and stabilizing market players?  Shenglaiyun: The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently held a comprehensive deployment of economic work in the next stage. Now the key is to implement and achieve practical results, and to ensure that the economic operation is maintained in a reasonable range.  The first is not to shake the general policy of ""dynamic zero"". It is necessary to deeply, complete, and comprehensively understand the policies and policies of the epidemic prevention and control of the Party Central Committee, deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of the resistance and struggle, always maintain a sober mind, unwilling to adhere to the ""dynamic clear zero"" general policy, and do a good job of "" Foreign defense input and internal defense rebound ""resolutely consolidate the results of the hard -to -control prevention and control of epidemic.  The second is to increase the policy of steady growth. It is necessary to play a key role in effective investment. From historical experience, expanding infrastructure investment is the most useful move to deal with short -term economic difficulties. From the perspective of the reality of our country, there is still a very wide space investment in infrastructure. The existing per capita infrastructure of my country is equivalent to 20%to 30%of developed countries, and the per capita railway business mileage is 30%of the United States. It is even more promising that the number of 5G mobile phone users in my country accounts for only about 20%of the total number of mobile phone users, and the consumption of clean energy consumption such as natural gas and water nuclear landscapes accounts for only about 25%of the total energy consumption.  The third is to effectively stabilize the market subject. Starting from the actual difficulties faced by market entities, especially small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households, use a variety of policy means such as tax refund, tax reduction, social security premiums, special funds for bailout, and inclusive small and micro loans. Market subjects have trouble to solve problems.  The fourth is to stabilize employment and protect people's livelihood. It is necessary to implement the policy of supporting and stabilizing jobs, helping and assisting personnel of key groups and employment difficulties, and trying to alleviate the impact of the epidemic on employment.

Social screening still has cases of concealment, and the current capital epidemic prevention and control is still uncertain. On May 11, the nucleic acid screening of Beijing City was 15.97 million, of which 8 tubes were positive. Beijing insisted on the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"". On May 12, the Beijing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work leadership group and the capital strictly entered Beijing management joint prevention joint control coordination mechanism decision: starting from May 13th, three consecutive consecutive consecutive three consecutive times Tian Tian carried out nucleic acid screening in 12 districts; refined the shortcomings of the vulnerability in the prevention and control work, and refined the specific measures to further compact the ""four -party responsibility"". The sieve tube was tightly tightened, and Beijing went all out to cut off the virus spread chain at the fastest speed.  Beijing has recently involved enterprises and construction sites in Beijing. Beijing's refinement has proposed specific measures to further compact the ""Quartet responsibility"". Three requirements are proposed in the responsibility of the main body of the unit: First, master basic information, establish normalized basic information accounts for various personnel information, and ensure that ""the source can be traced and the whereabouts can be chased."" The second is to strengthen personnel management and do a good job of liquidity prevention management of linear engineering personnel, security, cleaning, clock workers, decoration workers, express delivery brothers and other brothers. The supervision and inspection of personnel dense places will reasonably reduce personnel density. The third is to do a good job of emergency response. After the epidemic occurs in this unit, it is necessary to report to the industry authorities and territories as soon as possible, and quickly set up special classes for epidemic disposal to deal with them. Streaming traceability, settlement screening, inspection and control and other work.  In terms of compacting the management responsibilities of the industry, we will effectively strengthen the management and supervision and inspection of the internal and system in the industry, in -depth search for risk vulnerabilities, strengthen the construction of emergency response capabilities, and urge the units of the epidemic to fully cooperate with the epidemic disposal.  In terms of compacking the responsibility of the ground pocket, the districts are required to be responsible for the prevention and control of territorial epidemic situations, comprehensively understand the number of units, enterprises and other institutions and personnel in the jurisdiction, establish a daily contact communication and docking mechanism, and urge the implementation of normalization prevention and control requirements. Immediately after the epidemic occurred, coordinated treatment was carried out, and fixed -point treatment, observation observation, flow traceability, and nucleic acid testing were done.  In terms of compacting the responsibility of personal epidemic prevention, personnel are required to be prompted by the immune -related information, visited the point -related risk point, and the intersection of the short track of the person in the immune -related risk. Report to the unit and community (village) as soon as possible. After receiving the information of the risk personnel such as secret, sub -dense connection, you must not move in place and cooperate with the disposal.

475,Practice has proved that our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective ,仲音;,3,5/13/22,200,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruUbBhpPY_vp55W0kkVz76LM1y3_2q04jHus6vLzmav8VpHNjmabs9EFP1aaJ6G-S4akugTpKfxAzSqUmxza0jiBVtlWg0-I6j6TX_RqLksCwqmt5EGbHkFP&uniplatform=NZKPT,"Recently, the number of new infections daily in Shanghai has continued to decline, and the risk of spreading the epidemic community has been effectively curbed; as of May 9, more than 80%of infected people have been cured and they have been hospitalized. Promoting resumption of work, the city's ""fireworks"" is gradually returning ... After the joint efforts of all parties, the trend of the Shanghai epidemic has stabilized, the epidemic spread has been effectively controlled, and the epidemic prevention and control have achieved phased results. This is a powerful confirmation of the scientific and effectiveness of ""dynamic clearing"", and it is a strong refutation to the ""lying"" theory.  Since the end of February of this year, the strong and contagious Omikon variants have spread rapidly. There are many epidemic points, a wide range of outbreaks, and frequent occurrences. my country's epidemic prevention and control work has faced the most severe test since Wuhan's defense war. Facing the repeated impact of the epidemic, some biased voices are worthy of vigilance, or after thinking that infection of the mutant strain of Omikon, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infection can choose ""let go""; It is better to let it go as it is difficult to prevent; or it is considered that the cost of prevention of epidemic prevention is not necessary. All these are the so -called ""lying flat"" strategies that can coexist with the virus. In this regard, we must soberly realize that ""dynamic clearing"" is the best solution, and ""lying"" will definitely pay a huge price.  When measuring the harm of a large epidemic disease, the perspective of the group is the most important. At present, my country's COVID-19 vaccination is progressing smoothly, but the vaccination rate of the elderly and children is not high enough. The number of elderly people over 60 years of age has only 81.67%of the elderly population. And the barrier of death. With the total population base of more than 1.4 billion people in my country and the real national conditions of the huge elderly groups, if the epidemic dissemination is disseminated, a large number of severe cases and death cases will be occurred, and the medical resources of the country will eventually cause the unbearable losses of the people's lives and property. Essence At the same time, relaxation prevention and control will greatly increase the risk of virus mutation, and new mutant strains may bring new threats after the emergence of the appearance.  In fact, the reason why some countries choose to let go of prevention and control is because they cannot find the ideal strategy to control the epidemic, and the complex factors such as economic downturn and anti -epidemic fatigue mentality, ""lying flat"" is actually a helpless choice. However, the consequences brought by the number of cases and the high number of cases of death. Some countries have announced the ""coexistence with COVID-19 virus"" plans. After losing all restricted measures in the legal sense, the epidemic has continued to deteriorate, the level of infection has risen to the highest history, which brings heavy pressure on the medical and health system. At present, its medical system is still in State of difficult operation. Some countries have more than 1 million cases of COVID-19 deaths due to the spread of virus, and more than 200,000 children died in the COVID-19 epidemic due to their parents or other guardians, and they were unfortunately reduced to ""COVID-19 orphan"". When the global epidemic has not yet improved the substantive improvement, choosing ""lying flat"" is undoubtedly indifferent to science, the complexity and arduous contempt of the fight against epidemic, and the extreme irresponsibility of the public's life and health rights. This also reveals that ""lying down"" cannot ""lie down"" and will lose the difficult and control results of my country's early period.  From an economic perspective, strict prevention and control measures on the fierce epidemic will inevitably have a temporary impact on economic and social development. However, it must be realized that only when the epidemic is effectively controlled, economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. We should be confidently seen that my country's epidemic prevention and control has a good cost -effective ratio. In 2020, it was because of my country's ""the first to control the epidemic"" and ""the first to resume work and re -production"", and eventually ""the first to achieve economic growth from negative to positive"" in major economies; in 2021, my country's economy increased by 8.1%year -on -year, two years in two years The average increase of 5.1%, the economic development and epidemic prevention and control remained the world's leading position. In the first quarter of this year, my country's GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year, the growth rate was higher than 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The overall economic operation achieved a stable start. This is irrefutable that effective epidemic prevention and control is a powerful guarantee for economic development. Stable epidemic prevention results can create a stable and safe development environment for economic growth. Choosing ""lying flat"" will inevitably have a serious impact on economic and social development, and it will inevitably cause greater losses.  ""Lying flat"" has no way out, and persistence is victory. The British ""Daily Telegraph"" website recently published an article stating: ""If the final death is calculated, China's mortality rate is likely to be lower than most countries, and the price paid for it is much smaller."" Looking around the world, at present, at present, at present There are still a handful of countries with ""discovery and extinguishing together"" conditions. ""Dynamic clearing zero"" is still the best choice based on the current situation of my country's current epidemic. Practice has proved that our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective. Maintaining strategic determination, firm confidence, grasping the foundation early, discovering and extinguishing together, we must be able to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, minimizing the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development.",epidemic prevention and control; vaccination; prevent and control measures; science and effective; ,True

Li Guoping, director of security director of the Ministry of Transport, introduced the latest situation of logistics insurance and the smooth work at the State Council's policies.  Since March this year, the domestic epidemic has been frequent, and the control measures taken by trucks in some areas have caused obstacles to traffic, vehicle stays, and poor logistics. ""The Ministry of Transport earnestly implements the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, closely coordinated the department and strengthened the provincial linkage to promote the work of logistics insurance and the smooth work."" Li Guoping introduced the relevant progress: from April 21 The closed toll station continued to control the service area within 20 and shut down service areas. On May 4th, the first time the highway toll station cleared the target for the first time.  As the toll stations and service areas are fully resumed and the logistics is blocked rapidly, the traffic traffic of the nation's highway, especially trucks, has continued to rise steadily. Li Guoping said that on May 10, a total of 21.8773 million units across the country's highway, an increase of 26.39%over April 10. Among them, the traffic flow was 7.213 million, an increase of 25.65%over April 10. In addition, railway cargo delivery, highway freight volume, and main port cargo throughput on May 10 increased by 5.71%, 6.16%, and 1.12%from April 18; More than 80 % before the epidemic; the cargo and postal throughput of Shanghai Pudong Airport rose to more than 60 % before the epidemic.  In April this year, in order to ensure the rapid and convenient traffic of key supplies and vehicles, my country has launched a unified type of transportation vehicle pass. ""At present, 27 provinces have successively launched a unified type of pass to play a positive role in ensuring the transportation of key materials."" Han Jinghua, the person in charge of the Transport Services Department of the Ministry of Transport, specifically stated at the meeting that the two ends of the transportation of transportation are not at the epidemic situation. Vehicles that prevent and control key areas, or are not carried out of key supplies, do not need to apply, apply, and use the pass. Vehicles in various places should take effective measures to ensure that the vehicle is prioritized and fast. ""  In order to ensure the transportation of agricultural resources and agricultural products, the Ministry of Transport has recently adopted a series of measures to ensure that ordinary highways, especially rural highways, are unblocked. Wang Tai, the person in charge of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, told reporters that after a comprehensive investigation, the ""microcirculation"" of my country's rural highways is generally unblocked and no serious blocking problems have been found. Without approval, the behavior of digging the rural highway without authorization, strictly standardize the setting of rural highway epidemic prevention inspection points, optimize and improve control measures, improve the efficiency of epidemic prevention inspection, and maintain the normal production and living order of the people. ""  Looking forward to the next stage of work, Han Jinghua believes that with the changes in the epidemic situation, the problem of over -control control of trucks may still be repeated. ""We will continue to strengthen the tracking and supervision, guide localities to strictly implement the vehicle traffic guarantee measures, and effectively ensure that the truck is smoother.""  At the same time, the Ministry of Transport will also go all out to do a good job of logistics and protection in key areas such as the Yangtze River Delta and other outbreaks of the Yangtze River Delta. The first is the stable supply of biological capitals. Give full play to the important role of pass permits in the transportation of people's biological supplies, implement ""one certificate registration, one certificate review, and one certificate"", and realize ""fast inspection, fast detection, and fast pass"". The second is to protect the production and operation of key enterprises. For enterprises that include the ""white list"" of key enterprises, take measures such as priority capacity support, priority testing services, priority arrangement of loading and unloading, and preferred distribution. The third is to maintain the normal operation of key hubs.

Since the beginning of this year, the international situation has become more complicated and severe, and the domestic epidemic has also shown the characteristics of many, wide and frequent, and has increased its impact on the impact of economic operation. In the face of multiple challenges, my country's economy has achieved ""opening the door steadily"". In the first quarter, the GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year. The national economy continued to restore the development trend, and the economic operation was generally stable. The main macro indicators remained in a reasonable range.

Maintaining economic operations in a reasonable range and striving to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development throughout the year. Although we have a lot of challenges and heavy tasks, we are full of confidence and strong confidence.  The difficult road is uphill. Affected by the current epidemic, demand shrinkage, impact on supply, and expected weak triple pressure are more prominent, and new downward pressure has further increased. Facing the risk challenges on the road, we need to look at my country's development with a comprehensive, dialectical and long -term perspective. From the perspective of development, last year, my country's economic scale exceeded 11.0 trillion yuan, and the per capita GDP exceeded 80,000 yuan, exceeding the world average; from the perspective of supply potential, the industrial structure continued to be adjusted and optimized, and the complete advantages of the industrial system continued to show; The oversized market advantages of more than 1.4 billion people and more than 400 million medium -income groups continued to appear; from the perspective of the policy environment, reforms and regulation of ""combination boxing"" have continued to make efforts, and the stable growth co -operating is accelerating the formation.

We have enough confidence to defeat any difficulty challenges.  my country's economic potential, strong vitality, and policy tools, and abundant new movements allow us to climb the slopes and have confidence and confidence. In the first quarter, the national economy's ""three -driving troiders"" was steadily advanced. The total retail sales of social consumer goods increased by 3.3%year -on -year. The investment in fixed assets increased by 9.3%year -on -year. %. Since entering the second quarter, the policy has been properly advanced.

We have the ability and ability to keep up with downward pressure and stabilize the macro market; to maximize the impact of epidemic situation on the development of the epidemic on economic and social development, and promote high -quality development. We have confidence and conditions.  As the world's most potential market, China has the most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and comprehensive supporting capabilities. Great ... Although the COVID-19 epidemic and Ukraine crisis have led to an increase in risk challenges, the international community is still optimistic about China's economic growth prospects. The International Monetary Fund has lowered the expected global economic growth expectations this year, while still investing in China's economic investment ""trust votes"", and believes that ""China plays an important role in the global economic recovery."" Reports recently released by the German Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China show that 71%of German -funded enterprises and US -funded companies in 2/3 hopes to increase investment in China. The affirmation and expectations of the international community reflect the affirmation of the past achievements of the Chinese economy, and it is also an recognition of a stable trend and profound advantage in the Chinese economy.

Facing the future, we have ""full preparation of tough battles"", and we have the determination and courage to overwhelm all difficulties and not overwhelming the difficulties.

At this time, we need to maintain a sober mind, deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of the struggle against epidemic, overcome paralysis thoughts, warless mood, fluke, and relaxed attitude. It is not possible to prevent the results of the hard -won epidemic prevention and control.  Fighting with the epidemic is the wrestling of material and the spiritual counterpart; it is a contest of strength and a competition of will. Since the COVID-19 epidemic, my country has taken the lead in controlling the epidemic, the first to resume work, and the first to achieve economic growth in the world's major economies. my country maintains economic development and epidemic prevention and control global leading position, and a stable epidemic prevention and control situation provides a favorable environment. Barry is only half of 90. At present, my country's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage of popularization of Omikon virus variants. We must endure the prevention and control of the epidemic, and always tighten the string of the epidemic prevention and control.  my country is a large country with a population of more than 1.4 billion. It has great benefits and difficulties in the prevention and control of the epidemic. On the one hand, my country is large in depth. When the epidemic occurs in one place, we can mobilize resource support from various parties, so that we have conditions and capabilities to defeat the epidemic. On the other hand, my country's population is huge, the elderly population base is large, and the region is vast. There are differences in medical and health conditions in various places. The vaccination has imbalance between different people. Once the virus spreads across the country, the scale has rebounded. Medical and health resources will face severe risk of crowding. A large number of patients with basic diseases, elderly people, children, and pregnant women will be seriously threatened. The stable economic and social development will be seriously affected. And even abandoned before. If you go against the water, you will retreat if you do not enter. Faced with the dissemination of the mighty Omiroko mutant strains, we must attach great importance to it, deeply understand its potential harmfulness, make great determination, and control the epidemic as soon as possible to avoid causing sustainable social communication.  From the perspective of the virus itself, the Omikon variants not only have the characteristics of strong contagiousness, fast transmission speed, and high hiddenness, but also are constantly mutating. The direction of mutation still has high uncertainty. At the same time, the wider the virus is popular in the crowd, the more copying, the greater the possibility of mutation. At present, many countries have detected BA.4 and BA.5 of Omikon subtypes, and some countries have also found a new subtype BA.1.22 of Omikon strains. The reorganized strains of the subtype BA.1.1 and BA.2. Some virusists issued a warning: In addition to the common mutations, the COVID-19 virus will also evolve rapidly through reorganization. If one Omikon mutant strain is reorganized with another COVID-19 mutant plant Poison that can lead to more serious diseases. In the context of the COVID-19 virus's mutation rules, if relaxing prevention and control will accelerate the spread of the virus and provide a ""hotbed"" for its mutation. In this regard, insisting on dynamic clearance is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control that my country must keep the epidemic.  Persistence is victory, unity is strength. The Omikon mutant plant does add a lot of difficulty and severe challenges to the current prevention and control of the epidemic, but it does not mean that it is not possible to do the ""four early"" -the early discovery, early report, isolation, and early treatment. Tianjin, from the raid of the epidemic on January 8 to announced that the society was clear on January 21, the first large -scale in China faced Omikho to achieve a phased fruit; Shenzhen, from pressing the ""slow -moving key"" to the order of social production and life. Start recovers in an orderly manner, and less than 10 days ... Practice fully proves that the overall policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"" in my country is scientific and effective. We have a completely foundation, condition, and capable of achieving dynamic clearance. Adhering to the ""dynamic clearing zero"" without hesitation, firm confidence, facing difficulties, and stubborn fighting, we will be able to maintain and consolidate the results of the hard -controlled epidemic prevention and control, and to effectively and effectively protect the health of the people's lives and economic and social development.",Epidemic prevention and control; mutant strains; ,True

At present, the complexity, severeness, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment have risen. How can the China Banking Regulatory Commission further guide the bank industry insurance industry to increase and improve financial supply, and increase support for the real economy? How to effectively prevent and resolve financial risks and keep the financial system safe and stable? The reporter interviewed Liang Tao, a member of the Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission.  Increase and improve financial supply, and continue to increase support for the real economy  Reporter: Since this year, what measures have the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission guided the banking insurance industry to serve the real economy and how effective? In what aspects will bank insurance institutions increase their support for the real economy?  Liang Tao: The CBRC guides the banking insurance industry to further increase financial support for the real economy, continue to increase the total amount of credit investment, optimize the credit structure, reduce financing costs, and continue to continue the principal and interest policy. In the first quarter of this year, manufacturing loans increased 1.8 trillion yuan, which was 1.7 times the increase in the same period last year. The loan balance of inclusive small and micro enterprises was 2.06 trillion yuan, an increase of 22.6%year -on -year. The balance of high -tech industry loans exceeds 7 trillion yuan. In the first quarter, newly issued corporate loans and inclusive small and micro -enterprise loan interest rates decreased by more than 0.2 percentage points from the beginning of the year.  The current downward pressure on the economy has increased, and the banking insurance industry also encountered some difficulties in the process of supporting the real economy. For example, enterprises with severe impact on the epidemic have unstable operating income and difficult to repay bank loans as scheduled. The pressure of non -performing loans of bank institutions is greater; some enterprises' financing is mainly to maintain existing liquidity. Effective financing demand is relatively atrophic.  Faced with new difficulties and challenges, the next step of the CBRC will guide the bank industry insurance industry to increase and improve financial supply, and encourage large banks and other high -quality listed banks to release more credit resources. Establish and improve the long -term assessment mechanism of insurance funds, enrich the channels for insurance funds to participate in the capital market investment, encourage insurance asset management companies to increase the issuance of portfolio insurance asset management products, guide more funds to allocate equity assets, and continue to increase the pair of rights. The support of the real economy has the following measures:  Effectively increase support for weak links. Guide banks to increase the first loan and credit loan ratio in small and micro -enterprise loans, and continue to reduce loan interest rates. Ensure the steady growth of agricultural credit, and actively develop the first loan and credit loan of new agricultural business entities. Continue to standardize the development of the third pillar pension insurance to promote the improvement of health insurance services.  Promote the reduction of comprehensive financing costs of enterprises. Continuously standardize the charging behavior of banking institutional credit, loan assistance, credit increase and assessment links, and standardize the management of the bank service market to regulate the price management. Do a good job of credit evaluation and review of continuous financing in advance, and effectively reduce the cost of corporate funds.  Improve the level of financial services for new citizens. Guide bank insurance institutions to increase credit support and insurance guarantee for new citizens' entrepreneurial employment, house purchase, education and training, etc.  Implement the policy of helping enterprises' rescue policies and support market entities to relieve liquidity difficulties  Reporter: The state has issued a package of bailout assistance policies for industries and enterprises that have been seriously impacted by the epidemic.  Liang Tao: Since the beginning of this year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission has guided the banking insurance industry to increase the financial support of industries, small and medium -sized enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households that have been seriously impacted by the epidemic. Focus on supporting market players to relieve liquidity difficulties.  The first is to continue to increase loan support for small and micro enterprises and rural revitalization. Give full play to the regulatory anti -cyclical regulation, continue to clarify the goal of ""two increases"" of inclusive small and micro -enterprise loans, and the number of households. Among them, the newly added inclusive small and micro enterprise loans this year will reach 1.6 trillion yuan, and urban business Banks have significantly increased the proportion of loans for inclusive small and micro enterprises. The bank is required to help the county's inclined credit resources to the key counties of rural rejuvenation in grain production counties and 160 countries.  The second is to help difficulties in difficult industries through difficulties. Guide to urge bank insurance institutions to take the initiative to do a good job in loan credit and insurance claims, such as catering accommodation, retail, tourism culture, transportation, etc., and increase the tilt of financial resources in difficult industries. Guidance insurance institutions provide insurance to provide insurance protection for the property loss caused by the suspension of production due to the suspension of production and the business interruption. It is required that bank insurance institutions provide strong support for freight logistics and preservation, and provide flexible and convenient ""green channels"" services for transportation companies that undertake epidemic prevention and control and emergency transportation tasks, and reasonably adjust truck drivers, car loans, personal housing mortgage mortgages Wait for repayment arrangements.  The third is to strengthen financial services for regions where the epidemic is seriously affected by the epidemic. Combining the local epidemic prevention and control requirements and changes in the situation of the epidemic situation, guide the local Banking Supervision Bureau to introduce more targeted measures to help enterprises in accordance with local conditions, and coordinate and solve outstanding problems reflected by local industries, enterprises and the masses. For example, the Shanghai Banking Regulatory Bureau has increased the promotion of renewal, improves the efficiency of renewal loans, supports the seamless connection of the financing turnover of small and micro enterprises operating normally, and relieves the pressure of mobile funds.  The banking insurance industry maintains a stable operation, and the risk is generally controllable  Reporter: What impact will the current international and domestic risk challenges increase on the safe and stable operation of my country's banking insurance industry? What measures will be taken to effectively prevent possible risks in the next step?  Liang Tao: The current international situation is full of uncertainty. The tightening policy of developed economies in Europe and the United States may put a certain pressure on my country's cross -border capital flow and RMB exchange rate. At the same time, the price of imported raw materials may also rise, bringing pressure on the production and operation of small and medium -sized enterprises. Therefore, the secure and stable operation of the financial system is essential to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  my country's economy is stable and good, and the fundamental fundamentals have not changed for a long time. The banking insurance industry continues to maintain stable operation, and the risks are generally controllable. In the first quarter, the non -performing loan rate of the banking industry was 1.79%, maintaining a reasonable level; banking institutions continued to increase the handling of non -performing assets, and in the first quarter, it disposed of nearly 600 billion yuan. Insurance companies have maintained a high level of comprehensive settlement capacity and core solvency adequacy ratio, and the overall risk resistance capacity is strong.  At the same time, the risks in key areas are controllable. The real estate credit investment is generally stable, and the development of loans for real estate companies has grown forward for three consecutive months. It orderly meets the reasonable demand for real estate financing. The adverse rate of real estate loans is significantly lower than all loans, and the risk is controlled as a whole. The loans of inclusive small and micro enterprises continue to increase, expand, and reduce prices, and the risks in related fields are also better controlled.  In the next step, the China Banking Regulatory Commission will coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic development, the regulatory policies are advancing, and strive to stabilize the macroeconomic market.  The first is to increase financial support for the real economy. Continue to strengthen the credit support and insurance protection of industries and small and medium -sized enterprises, which have a greater influence of the epidemic, support the secure and stable supply chain of the industry chain supply chain. Optimize financial support in key consumer areas, improve the level of financial services for new citizens, support highway transportation construction, play a key role in effective investment, and fully support expanding domestic demand. Improve the financial support innovation system, increase the medium and long -term loans of the manufacturing industry, and better serve the key core technologies of the key core technology and the ""specialized new"" small and medium -sized enterprises.  The second is to resolutely and effectively prevent financial risks. Urges bank insurance institutions to do a good job of risk research, strengthen risk management, and effectively respond to changes in the international economic and financial situation. Further enrich the financial stabilization security fund, give play to the positive role of insurance security funds and trust industry security funds in risk disposal, and build a weaving financial security network.  The third is to actively promote the long -term healthy and stable development of the capital market. Give full play to the advantages of insurance funds for a long time, and guide insurance institutions to allocate more funds in equity assets.

Since the prevention and control of the normalization epidemic, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always adhered to the concept of ""people first, life first"", and adhered to the general strategy of ""external prevention input, internal prevention rebound"" and the ""dynamic clear zero"" general policy. A round of the impact of the epidemic has protecting the safety of people's lives and health to the greatest extent. Especially since March of this year, after fighting and fighting side by side in the country, we have adopted the most severe epidemic prevention and control test since Wuhan's defense war, and achieved staged results. Practice has once again proved that adhering to the ""dynamic clearing"" is not only a powerful embodiment of respect and law, but also the inevitable requirement of adhering to the people's supremacy and life supremacy.

Without any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. Omikon variants are by no means a ""large influenza"". The average mortality rate is 7 to 8 times that of ordinary flu. The disease mortality rate of the elderly over 80 years old, especially over 80, is nearly a hundred times more common influenza. From the perspective of the spread of global epidemic, the virus is constantly mutating, and the ultimate direction of the epidemic is still greatly uncertain. International public health experts have pointed out that the epidemic has not yet ended and still needs to be vigilant. Some ""lying"" countries have already paid a heavy price. Judging from the actual situation in my country, the number of elderly population is huge, coupled with a considerable number of children and people who cannot vaccinate the vaccine in contraindications. The vaccination rate has not yet formed a barrier that is sufficient to resist severe and dying. Once the epidemic is relaxed, and the rapid spread of viruses will inevitably cause large -scale people infection, a large number of severe illnesses and diseases, and the consequences are unimaginable. Adhering to the ""dynamic clearing zero"", this is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control of more than 1.4 billion people who must be more than 1.4 billion.  For a period of time, in all parts of the country, various fronts have adhered to their posts and continuous battles. It has made important contributions. At present, the overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe. There is a risk of rebound in the epidemic. It is necessary to speed up the treatment of local aggregate epidemic, timely improve prevention and control measures, and prepare for epidemic conditions. Persistence can victory. When this critical period and vigorous stage, we particularly cannot relax and need to continue to work hard. It is necessary to adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"", not paralyzed, not tired of fighting, not lucky, not loose, from the inspection to the inspection, the intervals, the acceptance, the treatment should be treated, and the synchronization should be synchronized.

""  Grow better in training  Our reporter Cheng Yizheng  ""My youth spent in the construction of the China -Pakistan Economic Corridor. This is a time that makes me proud and unforgettable."" In early 2022, Sun Zhen, a Chinese operating manager of Pakistan Sahivar Coal Power Station, said goodbye Start a new journey of life.  The Sahewal Power Station is about 120 kilometers southwest of the capital of Punjab's capital next to Punish. Larar is one of the economic centers of Pakistan, which has a dense population and a concentration of industries. Frequent power outage has always been a big bottleneck to restrict Lorrier's development. Not only not only in the summer is hot and difficult to live, but many factory companies cannot operate at all. In 2015, the completion of the Sahewal Power Station filled 1/4 of Pakistan's power gap, which greatly guaranteed the power supply in Laler and surrounding areas.  ""Power stations provide electrical protection for 10 million people in the surrounding areas."" Sun Zhen said that the stable operation of this power station is very important for the economic and industrial development of Punjab's Punjab province in Pakistan, and everyone has paid a lot of effort to achieve this goal.  In order to assist Pakistan to solve the problem of technical talents, the power station recruited Pakistani employees from the beginning of operation to help them cultivate their ability in actual work and gradually take over the operation of the power station.  As a Chinese operating manager, half of the team led by Sun Zhen was Pakistani employees, and Hassan was one of them. He has just graduated from college and has a good theoretical foundation, but his actual operation experience is insufficient. In order to ensure the long -term stable operation of the power plant, Sun Zhen taught his experience to Pakistan employees without reservation. ""Cultivate them well is responsible for the future of the power station.""  At the beginning, language was a problem for the exchange of China -Pakistan employees. To this end, Sun Zhen worked hard to learn professional terms, while actively looking for a daily spoken expression of Hazan who was similar to age. Soon, Sun Zhen and Hassan found a common hobby -football. After get off work, they organized the employees of China and Pakistan to watch and play the ball, and everyone became more and more familiar outside the work.  ""Due to a lot of communication, Sun Zhen's English level has improved rapidly, which surprised us. We also actively ask him to ask him about work."" Hassan said. Inadvertently, the problems of poor communication between China -Pakistan employees in the early days of operation were solved.  During the prevention and control of the epidemic, Sun Zhen was appointed as the person in charge of the epidemic prevention work of the power station. He knows that the epidemic prevention work is to ensure that 10 million people can use electricity normally. He said that it is not difficult to formulate epidemic prevention, and it is difficult to ensure that everyone is carefully executed. They seize all opportunities and promote the importance of epidemic prevention to the operation of power stations and the use of electricity guarantee for the surrounding people. There is such a sense of responsibility in my heart, and both employees of China and Pakistan can make meticulous requirements for implementing epidemic prevention.

Fighting the epidemic, firm confidence is important. At present, the global epidemic is still at a high level, the virus is constantly mutating. The ultimate direction of the epidemic is still great uncertainty. The overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe, and there is a risk of rebound. The method is always more difficult than the difficulty, and the determination is always more challenging. From the defense war in Wuhan, to the prevention and control of the normalized epidemic, to the all -chain of the full chain of the full chain of Verta and Omikon, we always adhere to the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"", and the first time it is to coordinate the testing, the flow,, the flow,,,, the flow,,,,,,, the flow,,, the flow,,,,,, The power of transfer, isolation, and treatment, and found together, and extinguishing together, effectively curbing the spread of the extensive area of the epidemic, which effectively reversed the dangerous momentum of virus spread.

Re -unify the ideological actions, the prevention and control requirements are implemented, the epidemic defense line is reinforced, the level of capacity is improved, and the confrontation is tightened. Over the shortest time to extinguish the epidemic and achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is a overall battle, and a nation's chess must be adhered to. Only when the epidemic is controlled in an orderly manner can we provide a solid guarantee for the people's life and health, and create favorable conditions for normal production and life. It is necessary to see that since the epidemic occurs, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has accurately grasped the changes in the situation of the epidemic, based on the overall situation, focusing on the overall situation, and comprehensively strengthened the centralized and unified leadership of the epidemic prevention and control. A strategic layout of unified command, comprehensive deployment, and three -dimensional prevention and control, gathered a strong combination of fighting against the disease. When this is the critical period and period of ""going against the water and not entering"", we must unify our thoughts and actions into the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, and consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political action with the Party Central Committee. , Group perspective, dynamic perspective to look at the problem, deal with short -term and long -term relationships, local and overall relationships, individuals and groups of relationships, both consider the prevention and control needs of the area in the area, but also consider prevention and control of key areas, prevention and control of the whole country, and the nation's national prevention and control. The influence, firm and powerful, do not slack down, cut off the source of infection at the fastest and most efficient efficiency, do its best to control the scope of the epidemic situation, and strive to win the comprehensive victory of the national epidemic prevention and control.  General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: ""Unity is iron, unity is steel, unity is power. Unity is an important guarantee for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to defeat the road of defeating the advanced road. Among them, party organizations at all levels and the majority of party members and cadres are responsible for keeping the land and abiding by the land.

"""" "".  We must fully realize that we are facing a century-old infectious disease epidemic. The COVID-19 virus is very cunning, and the strains are still mutating. Among the risks and threats brought by the epidemic still exist. Compared with other strains, the pathogenicity of Omikon's mutant strain itself has indeed weakened, but it has the characteristics of strong propagation, concealment, asymptomatic infection, etc., which is more likely to cause large -scale spread. Compared with the flu, the spread of the mutant plant of Omikon is much higher than the flu, and the pathogenic rate, especially the mortality of the disease, has also reached 7 to 8 times that of the flu. Threats are by no means ""influenza"" that some people think. The WHO COVID-19 The Big Epidemic Emergency Committee has once again rang the alarm clock again, determining that the COVID-19 virus still brings major dangers to the public health field, and countries must not relax their vigilance. Because of this, we must not look at the harm of Omikon's mutant strains to human communication. We must resolutely abandon the ""Omikon influenza theory"" and break the fantasy of ""no intervention, virus transmission will become slower.""  Seeing rabbits and dogs and dying sheep are for the sake of strategies; From the perspective of public health and the actual situation of our country, the whole population is the susceptible crowd of Omikon's mutant strains. my country is a large country with more than 1.4 billion people. In addition, the regional development is unbalanced, the total amount of medical resources is insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Faced with the repeated impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, if there is an indifferent attitude and adopt the so-called ""lying flat"" strategy coexisting with the virus, medical resources will face the risk of serious crowding. The physical health of the crowd will be threatened, and it will also have a serious impact on economic and social development. If you choose to let go of prevention and control, you will definitely miss the best time to resist the resistance. The final price will be higher, the loss will be greater, and the consequences will be more unimaginable. We must establish a bottom-line thinking, fully recognize the potential harmfulness of the virus, and always keep a high degree of vigilance in the risk of the spread of epidemic, and resolutely abandon the ""COVID-19 virus coexistence theory"".  The normalization of the epidemic is not an isolated policy, but a complex operating system. After the ""dynamic clearing"" stage of emergency response epidemic surrounding stage, normalization prevention and control exploration phase, and accurate prevention and control of full -chain, the prevention and control of my country's epidemic situation enters the ""scientific accuracy, dynamic clearing of dynamics, dynamic clearing, dynamic clearing, The fourth stage of zero "". At this stage, in addition to rapid and accurate, we must pay more attention to comprehensiveness, take some comprehensive prevention and control measures, perform effective combinations and superimposed, implement the stringent, most thorough, and resolute measures to prevent the epidemic from the epidemic. Social spread. In terms of prevention and control measures, you need to find the direction of the main attack, distinguish the priority of preventing and control measures, and control the risk people within the scope of control; Examination, flow, isolation, transfer, and community management and control coordinate and link with various types of information. At the same time, we must deeply realize that ""dynamic clearing zero"" is not an absolute ""zero infection"". In practice, it is necessary to continue to optimize and upgrade the prevention and control measures according to the new changes of the virus and the new situation of the epidemic. We must not have a self -righteous mentality, not only prevent the formation of ""air gear"" prevention and control, but also eliminating the practice of simplifying simplification and one -size -fits -all, in order to minimize the impact of epidemic conditions on economic and social development.  The prevention and control of the epidemic is a very specific job.

At present, the complexity, severe, and uncertainty of my country's economic development environment has risen, and it is facing new challenges to stabilize growth, employment, and stabilizing prices.

The first is the forward -looking reduction, maintaining a reasonable and abundant liquidity in terms of total, maintaining sufficient support for the real economy, increasing the long -term sources of funds for financial institutions, and increasing liquidity investment. The second is to continue the interest rate of the loan market to improve the efficiency of monetary policy conduction. The third is to actively make good use of structural monetary policies, focusing on supporting the service industry and small and micro enterprises that are affected by the influence of manufacturing and epidemic. A few days ago, we have converted two direct monetary policy tools to market -oriented policy tools that support small and micro enterprises. Recently, we have launched three major special re -loans, including 200 billion yuan of scientific and technological innovation and re -loan, 40 billion yuan of inclusive pension special re -loan, increasing 100 billion yuan of re -loan quota to support coal development and enhancement of energy storage, increase energy storage, increase Support for key areas and weak links. The fourth is to maintain the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level. In particular, it is necessary to point out that this year the People's Bank of China paid over 1 trillion yuan in deposit profit in accordance with law, which directly enhanced the financial available financial resources and effectively guaranteed the strength of fiscal expenditure. After the central bank paid profit after fiscal expenditure, it will sink the grassroots and direct market entities. It is expected that the growth rate of the broad currency (M2) of 2022 will be about 0.5 percentage points.  In the next stage, the People's Bank of China will put stable growth in a more prominent position in accordance with the requirements of the epidemic, the economy must be stabilized, and the development of security.

In the next step, how will the People's Bank of China support the development of market entities?  Chen Yulu: The People's Bank of China has resolutely implemented the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, conscientiously implemented various financial policies, adhered to ""two unshakables"", and supported the support of small and medium -sized enterprises, individual industrial and commercial households as the rearrassment of high -quality development of the real economy. Integrate, research and planning to continue to launch new financial support measures.  Recently, the People's Bank of China and the Foreign Exchange Bureau have issued 23 measures to help enterprises' rescue. These are all targeted policies in accordance with the general concern of market entities. Generally speaking, as financial support continues to increase, policy results are gradually emerging.  In the next step, the People's Bank of China will urge financial institutions to make good use of various financial policies to take the initiative to serve the real economy. The point is to accelerate the implementation of the determined policies and measures, actively plan the incremental policy tools, go all out to support the development of the market entities, and help small, medium and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households through difficulties.  For example, for enterprises such as catering and cultural tourism, accelerate the development of pledge and credit loan products in real estate; for groups that have seriously affected the epidemic, they will be flexibly delayed to repay the repayment time, extend the loan period, delay repayment and other methods to support methods. ; For enterprises such as highway logistics transportation and warehousing, accelerate the implementation of 100 billion yuan of re -loan policy, and reasonably support car loan exhibition or renewal; for scientific and technological enterprises such as ""specialized new"" SMEs, accelerate 200 billion yuan of scientific and technological innovation and re -loan landing to land Implement. At the same time, we must continue to promote the construction of long -term mechanisms for small and micro enterprises ""dare to loan, wish loan, loan, loan, and loan"", optimize the allocation of credit resources, strengthen the empowerment of fintech technology, and strive to improve the financing of small and micro enterprises And convenience.  Chinese financial markets still have a very strong long -term attraction to international investors  Reporter: Since the beginning of this year, the monetary policy of developed economies has shifted to accelerate, and the spillover effect of emerging markets has attracted widespread attention. How to look at the impact of this spillover effect on China's economic and financial?  Chen Yulu: Since the beginning of this year, the turning of the monetary policy of developed economies has been accelerating, and it will inevitably have an overflowing effect on other economies, especially emerging markets. The basic aspect of China's economy is stable and tough, and has the ability to cope with this overflow effect. The first is the steady economic recovery. In 2021, China GDP increased by 8.1%year -on -year and an average increase of 5.1%in two years. It ranked among the top in major global economies. In the first quarter of this year, China GDP increased by 4.8%year -on -year. Essence The second is that consumer prices rose moderately. In 2021, China's consumer prices rose by 0.9%year -on -year, and March this year was 1.5%, and inflation pressure was generally controllable. Third, the economic structure is continuously optimized, and the role of domestic demand has improved. The contribution rate of economic growth in the first quarter was 96.3%, which was higher than 79.1%in 2021; the effectiveness of innovation -driven results was significant. %, The growth rate is 7.7 percentage points higher than the industrial added value above the size.  China's financial markets still have a very strong long -term attraction to international investors. On the one hand, compared with developed economies, the actual return rate of China's assets is still high. This is determined by China's potential economic growth and natural interest rates. High investment returns are still an important attraction of China's financial market. On the other hand, China's financial market is an important target for diversified asset allocation. Thanks to the good epidemic prevention and control, the Chinese economy has been resumed earlier, and the domestic economic and policy cycle is not the same as that of other major economies. Essence  In recent years, China's financial industry has made great progress in opening up, and the two -way opening of the financial market has continued to expand. It has created a better environment for foreign capital to enter the Chinese market. International investors' recognition of RMB assets has also continued to increase.

The action is highly consistent with the Party Central Committee, overcoming paralysis thoughts, mood of war, fluke, and elasticity, comprehensively mobilize and comprehensively deploy. With the spirit of the spirit that does not wait at time, the actions that must be in every second must grasp the work of the epidemic.  Since mid -April, my country's epidemic situation has continued to fluctuate as a whole. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, after working together, we have adopted the most severe epidemic prevention and control test since the Wuhan defense war. One of the most important reasons why my country's epidemic prevention and control achieved staged results is that we insist on the fast word, and we must effectively and effectively build the epidemic situation from the strictness, the rapid, and the real prevention and control measures. Prevention and control barrier. Practice fully shows that adherence to the general policy of ""dynamic clearing zero"" is not hesitant, the attitude is resolute and decisive, the actions are rapidly and powerful, and the party's central decision -making decision -making to implement it.  At present, the overall situation of the national epidemic has improved, but it is still complicated and severe. There is a risk of rebound. It is necessary to resolutely build an epidemic prevention and control barrier and resolutely consolidate the results of the hard -to -control prevention and control of epidemic. ""If you go against the water, you will retreat if you do not enter."" When this critical period and vigorous stage, we need to maintain a sober mind. Sometimes we must not wait for the spirit, and have the sense of responsibility of ""constantly rest assured"". It is necessary to deeply realize that the global epidemic is still at a high level, the virus is constantly mutating, and there is still great uncertainty in the end of the epidemic. my country is a large population, there are many elderly population, the regional development is unbalanced, the total amount of medical resources is insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Once relaxed and prevent and control, the medical resources will face serious risk The physical health of pregnant women and other people will be threatened, and it will also have a serious impact on economic and social development. The people's supremacy and life first, curbing the epidemic as soon as possible is the truly respect for every life. Only when the epidemic is effectively controlled, the economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. It is necessary to accelerate the disposal of local aggregate epidemics, improve prevention and control measures in a timely manner, make every effort to prepare for the epidemic situation, and earnestly be responsible for defending the soil.  In the past two years, we have accumulated experience in the struggle with the COVID-19 virus. The emergency system, treatment system, public participation, and joint defense and joint control mechanism have formed a basic experience, to quickly improve. Although Omikon's mutant plant has a strong propagation, as long as it is discovered early, early reports, early isolation, early treatment, cutting off the transmission path, protecting the sensible people, and can still control the epidemic in time. Generally speaking, the earlier the epidemic discovered, the more clear the chain was spreading. If it is found late, especially when the scope of the source of the infected source and the infected person is affected and the crowds, it is necessary to appropriately expand the scope of management and control, strengthen the detection of nucleic acid, and strengthen the corresponding control measures. Now, my country's epidemic prevention and control has entered the fourth stage of comprehensive comprehensive prevention and control ""scientific and precise, dynamic clearing zero"". At this stage, in addition to fast and accurate, we must also pay attention to comprehensiveness. It is necessary to take some comprehensive prevention and control measures, including the rapid blocking of the source of infectious sources, the rapid blocking of the transmission pathway, and the protection of susceptible people. The most resolute and decisive measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic society.  Racing with the virus is to race with time. The faster you run, the more you can grasp the initiative of war. Practice has proven that our prevention and control policy is determined by the nature and purpose of the party. Our prevention and control policy can stand the test of historical testing. Our prevention and control measures are scientific and effective.

After 7 days of ""slow life"" in Shenzhen, Shenzhen has achieved the dynamic clearance of society, and Shenzhen has accelerated the ""return"". The epidemic is still at the end of the tail sweeping point, and the risks outside the isolation point and the seal control area have been basically controlled; the Beijing epidemic through regional nucleic acid screening and close inspection and control, the spread risk has been reduced ... the phased effect of the epidemic prevention and control has fully proved to be sufficiently proved The policies and policies determined by the Party Central Committee are completely correct, and the various prevention and control measures taken by the Party Central Committee are scientific and effective.  The normalization epidemic prevention and control is a difficult and heavy work that needs to be persisted for a long time. It must deeply understand the complexity and arduousness of resistance and struggle. From the outside, the global epidemic is still at high, and the virus is still mutating. The ultimate direction of the epidemic has great uncertainty, far before it can be relieved and rest. From the inside, China continues to face a large pressure input pressure, and the risk of local epidemic is still high. The domestic epidemic is exuded with multiple points and local aggregate epidemic. The situation is still severe and complicated. From the perspective of the characteristics of the virus, the Omikon mutant strains have the characteristics of strong infectiousness, fast transmission speed, and high hidden hiddenness. There are many asymptomatic and mild infection, which is more likely to cause large -scale spread. When this is the critical period and stages of ""going against the water and not advancing"", it is necessary to resolutely implement the decision -making and deployment of the Party Central Committee, adhere to the ""dynamic clear zero"" general policy of not hesitation, and determined to win confidence. Great courage, take the momentum, go up, and win the battle against this epidemic as soon as possible.  The closer to the goal, the more you need to climb the hill, unify your mind, increase your strength, and really work hard. It is necessary to deeply realize that ""dynamic clearing zero"" is determined by my country's basic national conditions. It is an inevitable requirement for our party to put people's life safety and health first. The virus fighting with Omikon mutation strains is not advisable to ""lying flat"", and ""lying to win"" is impossible.

How to get out of this difficult period to test the wisdom of governing the country and governing politics in various countries requires cooperation in the international community to respond. However, in the world's largest economy in the United States, many strange talks have emerged. The problem of high inflation is becoming increasingly serious. Ordinary people complained that some people in the United States did not reflect on their responsibilities, but attempted to prevent and control the Chinese epidemic. While ""shaking the pot"" China, these people have not forgotten to sing the Chinese economy, and make noise to decompose to China. Everyone with a clear eye can clearly see that these errors are incredible, not only cannot solve the US economic problems, but also to help the international community work together to spend difficulties.  In March of this year, the inflation rate in the United States reached more than 40 years. The main source of this problem is that the United States has implemented an unprecedented multi -round large -scale loose fiscal and monetary policy. The policy of large and water -filled policies has led to surge in fiscal deficit and superb currency. Under the stimulus of multiple rounds of radical fiscal and monetary policy, the total demand of American society has rebounded, but the effective supply is insufficient, and the overall price level is raised. The U.S. government once held the ""temporary theory of inflation"", which was insufficient to predict the severity of the problem, which led to a fault. After the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the United States attracted allies on the implementation of Russia's implementation of restrictions, causing a huge impact on global energy, food, and industrial chain, which further exacerbated the pressure of American inflation. For political reasons, the current US government has continued the mistakes of the previous government to China, and continued to levy high tariffs on a large number of Chinese -American commodities, significantly pushing the cost of imported goods, but American consumers had to pay for the government's wrong policy. The United States has a high inflation and is not determined for a long time. It originated from its own policies. Where is the ""throwing pot"" China and the politicalization of economic issues can be solved?  China's insistence on dynamics and shaking is the scientific decision -making based on national conditions, which reflects the concept of people's supremacy and life first. In fact, the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. China adheres to dynamic clearance, efficiently coordinates the prevention and control of epidemics and economic and social development. It is not only to prevent the epidemic and stabilize the economy. Some politicians in the United States frequently attack the prevention and control measures of China's epidemic, trying to impose the so -called ""disrupting the global supply chain"" to China, which is upside down black and white, and once again exposed the distorted mentality of being treated in China.  Affected by multiple factors, the downward pressure on the Chinese economy has recently increased, but the international economic community generally believes that China's economic toughness, sufficient potential, wide range of rooms, and long -term good fundamentals have not changed. China is fully capable of defeating difficulties and challenges, realizing sustainable and healthy development, providing strong kinetic energy for the stabilization of the world economy, and providing broader market opportunities for countries. Georkiya, president of the International Monetary Fund, has recently emphasized that the Chinese government has sufficient policy space to deal with the downward pressure on the economy and be able to boost the Chinese economy. In the first quarter of this year, the total imports and exports of Chinese goods increased by 10.7%year -on -year, and the actual use of foreign capital increased by 25.6%year -on -year, showing China's positive contribution to the stable global industrial chain supply chain, and also reflecting the confidence of enterprises in various countries in China's economic development prospects. Some people in the United States sing down the Chinese economy, which cannot change the confidence of the international community's long -term development of the Chinese economy, and it cannot stop the general trend of strengthening opening up cooperation with China.  Against the background of difficult recovery of the world economy, the urgency of major global economies to strengthen macro policy coordination is more prominent. The United States is the largest economy in the world, and its monetary policy ""rapid turn"" will undoubtedly bring serious challenges to the stability of the world economy and financial stability. The majority of developing countries will be the first. The International Monetary Fund warned at the beginning of this year that the Fed's faster tightening monetary policy may cause capital outflow and currency depreciation of emerging economies, and the prospects of economic growth are even more uncertain. As the Fed recently announced its interest rate hikes and will reduce the balance sheet of nearly 9 trillion US dollars from June 1, international public opinion is concerned that ""this may bring another impact on the world economy and financial markets."" Facing the concerns and concerns of all parties, the United States should strengthen communication and coordination with all parties to reduce the negative spilling effect of its economic policies, rather than passing the contradiction, finding scapegoats, and adding new risks to the world economy.  The era of our lives is an era of deep integration of the interests of various countries. Any approach to neighbors and extreme favors will eventually fail. The great powers should show their responsibilities and effectively promote the recovery of the world economy and the global sustainable development. China maintains its strategic determination, insists on doing its own, insist on expanding its high levels of opening up, working together to build an open world economy, and maintaining the stable supply chain of the global industrial chain.

In today's world, who still regards the United States as a ""lighthouse of human rights"" and an example of imitation?  The US media reported recently that the COVID-19 outbreak has led to more than 200,000 American children who lost their parents or main caregivers and became the ""orphan"". These orphans are also facing risks such as drug abuse, school loss, and poverty. However, the US media pointed out that the disadvantaged group that most needed help has not been ""treated as a urgent issue."" The facts once again show that the United States, which often uses human rights as an excuse, is in the United States, which is pointed at other countries, and is owed more debt in respect and guarantee the human rights of the country.  The huge number of ""epidemic orphan"" is the result of the US government's test of ""failure"" in the face of the epidemic test. So far, the COVID-19 death case in the United States has approached 1 million cases, and many families are fragmented. According to statistics, every 12 orphans under the age of 18 in the United States have one ""epidemic orphan"" among the 12 orphans. The ""New York City"" electronic report survey shows that every 200 children in New York City have a ""epidemic orphan"". However, in the face of these sad numbers, the US government and federal judges are still in the ""mask order"", and new epidemic prevention measures are also unable to be in place due to the disputes between the parliamentary party. US government health officials pointed out that if funds are not in place, it will be difficult for the United States to keep up with the speed of virus evolution, and people's health, economy and mentality will be greatly threatened.  The miserable situation of ""orphan"" reflects the US government's indifference to the basic human rights of vulnerable groups. The American ""Atlantic Monthly"" reported that a report entitled ""The Forgotten Epidemic Orphan"" recently pointed out that losing their parents at an early age may be the darkest time in life experience. Related reports show that some medical staff are unattended after their deaths, and some single mothers are forced to flow on the street after their illness. The US government lacks targeted assistance measures and has caused widespread criticism. Lecite Kidman, a social epidemiologist in the State University of New York, pointed out that the US government has a slow action when facing the largest orphan incident of the century. And raising arrangement. Susan Hillis, the head of the Children's Research Team, is affected by COVID-19, believes that the psychological problem of ""epidemic orphan"" may be accompanied by life, and a large number of public resources are needed to treat psychological trauma. However, it is difficult for the US government to even have the minimum material guarantee, let alone take care of its psychological problems.  The ""epidemic orphan"" shows obvious racial differences, which has enlarged the problem of systemic racial discrimination in American society. American scholars have found that the population of ethnic minorities accounts for 39%of the total US population, but the ethnic minority ""epidemic orphan"" accounts for 65%. On average, every 753 white children have one to become ""epidemic orphan"", and this corresponds to the average of Latin American descent every 412 children have become ""epidemic orphans"", 310 African descent and 168 indigenous Indians. Laocann Lei, a senior researcher at the Brucks Society in the United States, pointed out that when systemic racism was not past in the United States, it continued to spread in society and penetrate all aspects of daily life.  Focusing on the suffering of the people, giving special care for disadvantaged groups is the responsibility of a country's government. However, just when the U.S. ""epidemic orphan"" caused widespread public attention from public opinion, the US government did not think about taking remedial measures to solve the problem of concern to the people of the country. The human rights situation in the country and region says that it is three, but it only missed the United States. The German ""Youth World Daily"" pointed out that the United States issued a report to judge the human rights status of other countries each year, but its own human rights situation has continued to deteriorate, and the ""dual moral standards run through the beginning and end of the report.""  Politizing human rights and dual standards, trying to transfer the dissatisfaction of the country's dissatisfaction with the government is a completely poor performance, which can not hide the fact that the human rights situation of the United States has deteriorated. The phenomenon of ""orphan"" is just a microcosm of the increasing US government's increasing human rights debt.

Everyone rolled up their sleeves, and they built a biological safety standard here without losing the traditional laboratory's gas film laboratory.  ""We named it the 'Great Wall' nucleic acid detection laboratory, that is, I want to be a city to win the battle against this epidemic."" Xia Xiaokai said.  From March 20th, ambulances and trains from various places have continued to send nucleic acid samples. Hundreds of employees and volunteers scrambled against time and tested for 24 hours. Although the air conditioner was installed, the temperature in the laboratory was still close to 30 degrees Celsius. In this environment, wearing a tight protective clothing was very sultry.  ""You must not make an error!"" Li Wei said that the test results were accurate and directly related to the overall situation of the health of the masses and the prevention and control of the epidemic, so they strictly reviewed each test result. The laboratory can detect 50,000 samples every day, and the cumulative detection volume has exceeded 10 million. Every day, you have to compare a lot of data on your computer every day.

In the next step, what measures will the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology promote the steady growth of the industrial economy? The reporter interviewed Xin Guobin, deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  Multi -strategies can open up the industrial chain supply chain, and the pace of re -production and re -production in key areas in key areas accelerates the pace  Reporter: What new challenges are facing the current industrial economy? In terms of ensuring the smooth and stable supply chain of the industrial chain, what are the work and information of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and what is the current progress?  Xin Guobin: In the first quarter, the added value of industrial industries above designated size increased by 6.5%year -on -year, which was 2.6 percentage points accelerated from the fourth quarter of 2021 to maintain the momentum of continuing to recover. However, since mid -late March, some new situations and problems have experienced the industrial economy, and new downward pressure has been faced. According to the analysis of the situation reflected in various places, the most prominent difficulty is that the external environment is severe and complicated, the unstable uncertainty increases, and the overlapping epidemic is more distributed, resulting in increasing the suspension of enterprises' suspension of production and poor logistics transportation. In addition, the price of large raw materials continued to fluctuate at a high level, increasing the cost of middle and lower reaches, and the pressure on the turnover of small and medium -sized enterprises' funds, which affected the stable operation of the industrial chain supply chain.  In the face of these difficulties, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology regarded the unblocked industrial chain supply chain as the primary task of the current work, and immediately established a ""whitelist"" system for the key industry chain supply chain supply chain enterprise, and quickly adopted a series of measures with relevant departments to make preservation and stability. Chain rejuvenation ""combination boxing"".  Strengthen multi -party collaboration. Print the work plan and send a front work group to key areas to do a good job of medical material guarantee and the promotion of corporate resumption of work.  Determine the focus of protection. Focusing on the four areas of anti -epidemic prevention and medical supplies, essential materials for residents, important materials for agricultural production, and key supplies of strategic emerging industries, establish a ""white list"" system for key enterprises. It has determined 1624 key enterprises in four batches and guided 17 provinces Establish a ""white list"" of key enterprises at the local level, coordinate and solve specific difficulties and problems reflected by key enterprises in a timely coordination, and ensure factor service guarantee.  Grasp the key industry chain to keep it well. A coordination platform for the supply chain coordination platform of key industrial chain supply chain of automobiles, integrated circuits, and medical supplies has been established, focusing on key areas such as the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, etc., one by one to promote the return of employees' return, logistics and transportation such as employees reflected by the industrial chain enterprises, and strive to ensure upstream and downstream enterprises. Coordinated production, with some chains and chain -with surfaces to ensure that the key industry chain is running smoothly.  Through the joint efforts of various regions and departments, preliminary results have been achieved, and the pace of re -production and recovery in key areas and key industries has accelerated. As of April 28, among Shanghai's first batch of 666 ""whiters"" enterprises, the re -work rate reached 86.8%, of which the re -work rate of the vehicle and parts of the component of the automobile manufacturing industry reached 77%. Integrated circuit design, manufacturing, and testing The re -work rate of related enterprises reached 91%. The 50 backbone enterprises monitored by Jilin Province reached 98%.  In the next step, we will work in three aspects: First, to ensure stable production of key enterprises. Promote the ""white list"" area of key enterprises in various places, and coordinate and refine the work guarantee work. The second is to ensure the stable operation of key industries. Give full play to the role of the industrial chain supply chain coordination platform, open up the card points, and concentrate the resource priority to ensure that integrated circuits, automobiles, equipment manufacturing, biomedical and other key industries and other industries have been resumed. The third is to ensure the smooth cycle of industries in key areas. Focus on key industrial agglomeration areas such as the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, strengthen cross -regional and cross -provincial coordination, adopt point -to -point, one -to -one, short and fast way, effectively solve practical problems, and promote regional coordinated work and re -production.  The industrial economy shows signs of stability, and the long -term good fundamentals will not change  Reporter: How do you think of the new situation and problems of the current industrial economy, and what measures will the next step to promote the steady growth of the industrial economy?  Xin Guobin: The epidemic should be defended, the economy must be stabilized, and the development is safe. With the joint efforts of all parties, since mid -April, the industrial economy has gradually shown signs of stability. Beginning the second week of April, industrial electricity consumption has narrowed for two consecutive weeks; the industrial agglomeration index of mobile phone signaling monitoring has also risen stable. In general, the current difficulties encountered by the industrial economy are short -term and temporary. We have a complete industrial category, a complete supporting system, a broad market space, and a strong leadership of the Party Central Committee. The long -term fundamentals of my country's industrial economy will not change.  In the next step, we will conscientiously implement the spirit of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, efficiently coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, strengthen confidence, and overcome difficulties, and focus on four aspects:  The first is to go all out to keep and keep the industry and stabilize the industrial chain. Implement the ""whitelist"" system for the key industry chain supply chain enterprises, on the basis of doing a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic, ensure stable production of key enterprises, strengthen cross -regional coordination, and strive to open up the blocking point of the industrial chain supply chain in some places Card point, accelerate the re -production and re -production of enterprises.  The second is to go all out to help the enterprise to relieve the rescue and help enterprises through difficulties. Promote the implementation of policies to help enterprises and enterprises, provide accurate services, and carry out special rectification of the ""three chaos"" issues involving enterprises. The three -pronged approach of policies, services, and the environment, coordinated efforts to help small and medium -sized enterprises stable and safe development.  The third is to go all out to expand domestic demand and deeply stimulate growth potential. Persist in grasping both ends and grab the investment. Accelerate the implementation of major projects and projects of the ""Fourteenth Five -Year Plan"" planning industry, support the implementation of major technological transformation of energy conservation and carbon reduction in key areas, and guide basic telecommunications companies to moderately deploy 5G base stations construction in advance. Grasp the expansion of consumption. Fully excavate car consumption, information consumption, green consumption potential, organize a new round of new energy vehicles to go to the countryside, start a pilot of comprehensive electricized cities in the public domain, cultivate information consumption demonstration cities and demonstration projects, accelerate 5G technology and energy, education, etc. Vertical industry integration application.  The fourth is to go all out to stabilize expectations and boost the confidence of market players. On the one hand, strengthening coordination and coordination, promoting the promotion of policies to better implement, and make the majority of enterprises a sense of gain. On the other hand, do a good job of policy reserves, formulate and improve the plan for response plans for new challenges that may occur, and promptly introduce strong measures in a timely manner.  Persist in policies and services in both hands to further help small and medium -sized enterprises to relieve difficulties  Reporter: What are the work and information of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Hui Enterprise's bailout and how to continue to help SMEs in the next step?  Xin Guobin: We adhere to policies to benefit enterprises, serve enterprises, and environmental enterprises, and implement a package of measures to help small and medium -sized enterprises. The first is to grasp policy supply. Since the beginning of this year, the national level has introduced various types of policies such as tax cuts, tanks and expansion, financing promotion, and unblocking logistics. The second is to grasp service to help companies. Improve the service system of SMEs, gather and drive various high -quality resource services SMEs, and guide financial institutions to increase their support for SMEs. The third is to grasp the business environment. Organize the special rectification of the ""three chaos"" issues involved in enterprises, conduct in -depth work to prevent and resolve the accounts for minor and medium -sized enterprises, and strive to reduce the burden on small and medium -sized enterprises.  All localities have also taken strong measures in accordance with their own reality. For example, in terms of unblocked logistics, guide the establishment of material transportation connection areas in the industrial park and the establishment of a ""whitelist"" system for truck drivers; in terms of supporting enterprises to resume work, set up special classes to solve the problem of production factor protection of enterprises and carry out ""big visits"" In -depth first -line helping enterprises to relieve difficulties; in terms of reducing the operating costs of the enterprise, relevant enterprise employees are incorporated into the free nucleic acid testing population and the cost of electricity for enterprises is reduced. A series of innovative measures will effectively alleviate the impact of the epidemic on SMEs.  In the next step, we will actively work together with various regions and relevant departments to continue to grasp policies and services to further help SMEs to relieve difficulties.  On the one hand, the implementation of policies has been implemented. Improve policy services digital platforms, organize public service platforms at all levels to enter enterprises, parks, and clusters, and carry out policy interpretation and publicity work. Organize the implementation of special inspections to reduce the burden on enterprises and promote the development of SMEs, solve the problem of blocking points, and ensure that the implementation of various “reduction, exemption, and relief” to help enterprises and enterprises have been implemented.  On the other hand, focus on providing precise services. Organize the service month activities of SMEs, focus on short -board weaknesses in the entrepreneurial innovation, digital transformation, management improvement, and market development of small and medium -sized enterprises to help small and medium -sized enterprises solve the specific difficulties and problems encountered in production and operation and development. Quality, strive to provide small and medium -sized enterprises with services that can be found, affordable, and secure, and further enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises.",industrial chain; white list; key industries; supply chain; epidemic prevention and control; medical supplies; logistics transportation; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; Combination Boxing; ,True

Under the multiple tests of the international environment more complicated and severe and the frequent domestic epidemic conditions, the Chinese economy achieved ""opening the door stable"" in the first quarter. It can be said that it is extremely difficult and valuable.

At the press conference of the National New Office held on April 29, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, said.  Since the end of February this year, in the face of the popularity of Omikon's mutation, my country's epidemic has a large, wide -faced, and frequent characteristics, and severe tests for preventing and controlling work. The press conference introduced the relevant situation of adhering to the ""dynamic clearing zero"" to do a good job in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and answered questions from reporters on hot questions.  National COVID-19 outbreaks are fluctuating and declined  ""At present, Jilin and other gathering epidemics have been effectively controlled. The zero -tackling battle in Shanghai has achieved results, and the national epidemic is in volatility."" Li Bin said that my country has always adhered to ""dynamic clearance"". Time coordinating and adjusting forces such as testing, flowing, transfer, isolation, and treatment, etc., to maximize the spread of epidemic spread.  Li Bin said that ""dynamic clearing zero"" is not an absolute ""zero infection"". my country has accumulated a set of effective prevention and control measures in the rich prevention and control practice, and according to the new changes and new situations of the virus. Continuously optimized and upgraded prevention and control measures.  In response to whether the coexistence strategy can be implemented in some places, and the ""dynamic clearing"" problem in other places, Li Bin responded that the prevention and control of the epidemic is a overall battle. It is necessary to enhance the awareness of the overall situation and adhere to a game of chess across the country. Only the epidemic is in an orderly manner. Control can provide a solid guarantee for the lives and health of the people, and create favorable conditions for normal production and life.  Li Bin said that under the premise of adhering to the unwavering of the ""dynamic clearing zero"", encourage places to explore and summarize some good experiences and practices in accordance with the local epidemic situation and characteristics, further improve the scientific and precise level of epidemic prevention and control, and work hard to use the minimum minimum use The cost of cost is the greatest prevention and control effect.  To fight against Omikon, we must really achieve the ""four morning""  ""Although the Omikon variants have the characteristics of strong communication, strong hiddenness, asymptomatic infection, etc., it does not mean that it cannot be done 'four early' -early discovery, early report, early isolation and early treatment."" Liang Wannian, the leader of the Expert Group of the State Health and Health Commission's epidemic response work leading group, said that the joint detection strategy of nucleic acid+antigen self -testing is now advocated. Generally speaking, the sooner the epidemic discovered, the more clear the chain was spread.  Liang Wannian said that the ""four morning"" must be guaranteed by a series of concepts, abilities and mechanisms. When dealing with the epidemic, all localities must be prepared accordingly, including monitoring capabilities, discovery reports, and rapid response capabilities. If it is found late, especially when the scope of the source of the infected source and the infected person is affected and the crowds, it is necessary to appropriately expand the scope of management and control, strengthen the detection of nucleic acid, and strengthen the corresponding control measures.  Liang Wannian believes that my country has the technology and means of ""four early"", such as nucleic acid detection technology and antigen self -testing technology that has been widely promoted. In addition, there is a complete monitoring system, and the monitoring capabilities are further strengthening. For more than two years, he has accumulated experience in the struggle with the COVID-19 virus. The emergency system, treatment system, public participation, and joint defense and joint control mechanism have formed a basic experience, which is to quickly improve. As long as we use these well, we can definitely implement the ""four morning"" and defeat the COVID-19 epidemic at the minimum cost.  Liang Wannian said that my country is a large population, the regional development is unbalanced, the medical resources are generally insufficient, and the resource allocation is unbalanced. Adopting the so -called ""lying"" strategy coexisting with the virus, medical resources will face the risk of serious crowding. The physical health of a large number of patients with basic diseases, elderly people, children, pregnant women and other people will be threatened, and economic and social development will also be. It will cause serious impact. In this case, we must adhere to the ""dynamic clearing zero"" general policy.  Establish a ""yellow code"" hospital to ensure normal medical services  Liang Wannian said that when calculating the cost and income of the COVID-19 epidemic, the overall account, overall account, and dynamic account settlement should be calculated. The ultimate goal of ""dynamic clearing zero"" is to maximize the protection of people's lives and health, while protecting the economic and social development and normal production and life to the greatest extent.  ""The"" dynamic clearing ""general policy and a series of anti -epidemic measures adopted by our country are equivalent to buying an insurance for more than 1.4 billion people to respond to uncertain factors such as epidemic changes. The purpose is to maximize the overall social welfare. ""Liang Wannian said.  In terms of guaranteeing normal medical services, Li Bin said that the National Health and Health Commission deployment requires the establishment of a ""yellow code"" hospital in various places to open a ""cloud clinic"". The emergency, rescue room, operating room, and ward buffer area, medical staff strictly implemented the first consultation system and emergency and severe severe rescue system, do a good job in personal protection, and timely and effective treatment, do not refuse for any reason, delay treatment. At the same time, it is necessary to meet the needs of special groups, improve medical security in the epidemic area, and coordinate the prevention and control of epidemic situations within the medical institution.  During the full effort to ensure the medical needs of the people's normal treatment during the epidemic situation, to ensure the supply of people's living materials during the epidemic, Lei Zhenglong, the head of the National Health and Health Commission's CDC, said that according to the changes in the situation of the epidemic situation and prevention and control work The actual needs, the prevention and control policies and measures are also constantly adjusted and improved to better coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development.  Greater cities brought inspiration to the covid-19 epidemic  Li Bin said that the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in my country is divided into four stages: the first stage, the emergency surrounding stage of the emergency epidemic. It took about three months to achieve the decisive results of the Wuhan Defense War and the Battle of Hubei. In the second stage, the exploration stage of normalization prevention and control. The centered on nucleic acid testing is used to expand prevention, and the epidemic is controlled with 2-3 incubation periods. In the third stage, the full chain is precisely prevent and control, and the ""dynamic clear zero"" stage. Based on the foundation of grasping the small and grasping early, make full use of the ""golden 24 hours"" after the epidemic, and strive to control the epidemic around a period of incubation. At present, my country has entered the fourth stage of comprehensive and comprehensive prevention and control ""science and precision, dynamic clearing zero"".  What are the inspirations for the prevention and control of large cities? Liang Wannian said that Beijing and Shanghai are both large cities. The rapid spread of Omikon's mutant strains is a test of urban governance system and governance capabilities.  The first is to optimize and improve the past to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The general one is to rush quickly and run with the virus in time.  The second is to establish confidence. The practice of some cities proves that taking effective strategies and play methods can control the spread of the epidemic and achieve ""dynamic clearing zero"".  Third, in front of Omikon's mutant strains, the most vulnerable crowd is the elderly and basic diseases. The most effective way to protect is vaccination. The proportion of elderly population in Beijing and Shanghai is higher than the national average, strengthen the vaccination of the elderly, and effectively enhance the vaccination rate of vaccination, including strengthening needles, which is an effective means to protect the safety of the elderly and physical health.  The fourth is that the anti -attack epidemic is a systematic engineering, and a strong joint force needs to be formed. The anti -epidemic in Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities should be mobilized by the whole society, and the concept of system engineering should be implemented with the responsibility of the Quartet.",Epidemic prevention and control; general policy; nucleic acid testing; ,True

What is unchanged is Zhang Dingyu's busy figure and dedicated spirit. In the past two years, he has conducted in -depth investigations to promote the construction of medical institutions' service capabilities, the development of traditional Chinese medicine, and the prevention and control of the epidemic, and work hard to protect the lives of the people.  After graduating from Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1986, Zhang Dingyu worked in clinical first -line clinical first -line in Wuhan Fourth Hospital and Wuhan Pu'ai Hospital. For more than 30 years, he has repeatedly asked the ""battlefield"" many times -leading the third medical team in Hubei Province to the Wenchuan disaster area to rescue the wounded, and to the Chinese medical team to Algeria, Pakistan and other countries to carry out international medical assistance, save the disaster area and warfire. s life.  In 2013, Zhang Dingyu was transferred to the president of Jin Yintan Hospital in Wuhan. He took the lead in introducing advanced equipment such as high -flow oxygen absorption devices, ECMO (artificial membrane lung), etc., and also led the hospital to successfully identify the eligibility of the drug clinical trial institution and conduct drug clinical trials. In 2018, it also established a post -doctoral mobile station with the Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to carry out clinical and scientific research cooperation, laying a solid foundation for the hospital's future emergencies.  More than two years ago, near the Lunar New Year, Wuhan Jinshan Tan Hospital, located in the northwest of Wuhan City, has successively treated some unknown causes of pneumonia. Zhang Dingyu, then the dean of Jin Yintan Hospital, Wuhan City, immediately arranged for patients with alveolar irrigation and samples to win the time for later locking the COVID-19 virus.  Faced with the aggressive epidemic, Zhang Dingyu urgently arranged for the hospital to purchase ventilator, guardians, infusion pumps and other equipment, continuously retired from new ward and ward, and reserved beds for continuous increased patients. On the eve of the Spring Festival, all 21 ward areas of Jinyantan Hospital were renovated, disinfected, and arranged, and they were put into use.  ""I am a doctor, a member of the party, and the dean of the medical treatment of public health in Hubei Province and Wuhan City. At a critical moment, I can't shrink back."" Zhang Dingyu said. In the face of more and more patients and the increasingly stretched medical staff, Zhang Dingyu was sleepy, taking the hospital as the home, from the ward reconstruction, the management of the hospital, to the specific medication and treatment of patients, he had a detailed arrangement and participation.  Just when Zhang Dingyu went all out to race with the virus, the bad news came: his wife, a nurse at the fourth hospital of Wuhan City, was unfortunately infected. Although the husband and wife were only more than 10 kilometers apart, Zhang Dingyu, who was lacking in the avatar, did not squeeze out the time until late at night on the third day, and then returned to work. After learning that his wife had improved, the stone in his heart fell to the ground.  One night, Zhang Dingyu went to the intensive ward. A 60 -year -old blind patient, grabbed his arm and asked, ""Are you Dean Zhang?""  ""How do you know it is me?"" Zhang Dingyu was surprised.  ""Your footsteps are different from everyone,"" the old man said.  After the epidemic, Zhang Dingyu continued to work at a high load, and walking more and more strenuous. In order to dispel everyone’s doubts, at a meeting of the hospital, he disclosed the fact that he suffered from gradient: ""I don't have much time, I must run faster to get back with you, grab it from the virus's hand to grab it back from the virus. More patients! Please everyone! ""  Driven by Zhang Dingyu, who was the first soldier, the cadres and staff of the hospital rushed to the front line of resistance.

The second is the coexistence of large -scale and scattered epidemic. The number of reporters in Shanghai and Jilin Province accounted for more than 95%of the total number of nation. The third is to continue to present a complex situation of multi -point multi -source and multi -chain. There are many epidemic dissemination chains in many provinces. They are both overflowing out of the epidemic and an epidemic at the source of the local area, which increases the complexity and arduousness of prevention and control.  ""The epidemic in Jilin Province has continued to decline; the overall show of the Shanghai outbreak is significantly declining, the risk of social epidemic is gradually decreasing, but the prevention and control situation is still severe."" Wu Liangyou said.  Zhou Yan, deputy director of the Emergency Office of the Ministry of Transport, said that it is expected that the number of passengers in the country will be 100 million passengers and averaging 20 million daily, a decrease of about 62%compared with the same period of 2021.

US media reports pointed out that behind this amazing number is the tragedy of countless families, and the ""epidemic orphan"" of about 200,000 to lose their parents or the main caregivers, the U.S. government helps these orphans.  In July last year, a black couple Martin and Trina, a black couple in Savana, Georgia, died of COVID-19 in a few hours, leaving two children in their ten-year-old. ""No one knows how to accept the pain of losing parents. Lost two relatives on the same day, which is too heavy."" According to the two children's cousin Kolnelis, in the school where the two children are located, they also Dozens of students' parents died of COVID-19. Corinelis said: ""The government must realize that many children are in this situation. They have lost their parents in the epidemic, and they need to be economically supported by economic and mental health.""  This is not a case. According to the US ""Atlantic Monthly"" recently reported, about 200,000 American children lived in the pain of losing their parents due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The article pointed out that even after two years of the epidemic, the number of people who became orphans became so amazing. Among the orphans under the age of 18, every 12 people loses the guardian because of the epidemic; in the United States, there are two children in each public school who lose one guardian due to the epidemic.

Researchers have also found that the ""epidemic orphan"" problem in vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities is even more serious. These orphans are incompetent come from low -income and non -white families. They have faced many difficulties in their lives, and they have worsened the caregivers. Studies from the US Centers for Disease Control have pointed out that there are obvious racial differences in the COVID-19 epidemic death case, and minority children account for 65%of the ""orphan"".  ""The U.S. Epidemic Orphan"" is being ignored. ""The article"" Atlantic Monthly ""pointed out that losing parents at a young age may be the darkest time in life experience. The risk of orphan abuse of drugs, dropping out and falling into poverty has increased. The possibility of dying from suicide is almost twice orphans, and they may suffer from all kinds of problems.  Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Harvard University, said that the epidemic caused many children to suddenly lose dependence, which has become a potential serious social problem. Losing parents or caregivers in childhood is a major trauma. Susan Hillis, a senior technical consultant at the US Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Centers for Childhood, may have a profound long -term impact on children's health and well -being.

Faced with the neglected group of ""orphan"", the government's inadequate assistance continued to trigger criticism from American society. Many experts point out that although there are some assistance measures in various places, they lack a strong national strategy. The U.S. government recently issued a memorandum of memo including helping people and other contents in the epidemic, but the relevant person in charge, Mary Wall, said that there will be no dedicated teams in related actions. funds. Wall said that if new funds are required to encounter problems, because the US Congress is difficult to reach an agreement in the most basic anti -epidemic measures such as treatment, testing, vaccine, etc.  The article ""Atlantic Monthly"" quoted experts from the expert: ""'Opone orphan' needs to be helped in time.

At present, Shanghai is at the critical stage of prevention and control of epidemic. Zero tackling operations have achieved important stages of results, and some positive changes are emerging. This is a full confirmation of dynamic clearance science and effectiveness, and it is also a full confirmation of our conditions and capable of achieving dynamic clearing zero.  To measure the severity of virus popularity, we must comprehensively consider the communication power and the severe illness and death. From the perspective of propagation, Omikon's spread is much greater than the flu and the previous COVID-19 virus strains. In the absence of any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. From the perspective of disease mortality, the average mortality rate of the global influenza is 0.1%, and the average disease mortality rate of Omikon's mutant strains is about 0.75%, which is 7 to 8 times the flu. More than 10%is nearly a hundred times the normal flu. This warns us that Omikon is by no means the so -called ""large flu"", and its harm must not be underestimated.  To curb the epidemic as soon as possible is the true respect for every life, and adherence to the ""dynamic clearing"" essence is to adhere to the people's supremacy and life first. Judging from the actual situation in my country, the number of elderly population in my country is huge, coupled with a considerable number of children and people who cannot vaccine with contraindications, the vaccination rate has not yet formed a barrier to resist to severe and death. Once relaxed the epidemic prevention and control and letting the virus spread, it is bound to cause a large number of people to be infected in the short term, and there will be a large number of severe cases and death cases, causing medical resources to be crowded, so that normal medical service needs will not be resolved. Large -scale infection. Once such a vicious circle is formed, it will be a huge disaster. In this regard, adhering to the dynamic clearance is the bottom line of the epidemic prevention and control of more than 1.4 billion people who must be kept before.  To deal with infectious diseases, we need to consider the severity of the virus, the handling capacity of the medical system, and the social public health intervention measures. Some of the infectious diseases we have encountered in the past, such as tuberculosis, are also very harmful, but through strengthening the construction of the medical system, we can effectively block its spread. In comparison, the COVID-19 virus, especially Omikon, has a fast transmission, strong hidden, short incubation period, and a large number of infections. In addition, the virus is still mutating. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the social public health intervention measures, and to make efforts for the three links: the source of infection, the transmission pathway, and the susceptible population. Only in this way can we cut off the way of spreading the epidemic as soon as possible, so that the epidemic is not allowed to cause continuous community transmission and a scale rebound. It can be said that adherence to dynamic clearance is not only an inevitable requirement of adhering to the people's supremacy and life first, but also a powerful manifestation of respect for science and respect.  Anti -fighting epidemic is a systematic project. It is necessary to consider three aspects at the same time: one is to control the epidemic situation, the other is to ensure the normal life of the people, and the third is to ensure that the economic and social operations are necessary. The three are indispensable. The prevention and control of the epidemic and normal production and life, and the development of economic and social development are by no means a ""single -choice question"". It is by no means opposite, but a complementary, dialectical and unified relationship. Tompassing the guarantee of the supply and opening up the ""last 100 meters"" to get through the distribution of materials to solve specific problems for the masses. The meaning of the deserves.  The first consideration of determining the best plan for anti -fighting epidemic is to maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health to the greatest extent. In dynamic clearance, ""dynamic"" is to discover and extinguish together, keeping the bottom line that does not occur in the scale of the scale of the epidemic; ""Clear,"" Clear Zero ""at this stage is for"" epidemic "". Practice has repeatedly proved that dynamic clearance is the best choice based on my country's current epidemic situation. It is the best choice to adhere to the people's supremacy and life first, and it is also the key to curbing the spread of the epidemic spread as soon as possible. Adhere to the ""dynamic clearing zero"" general policy of not hesitation and shake, to determine the confidence of victory, and effectively implement various measures in place, fight hard work, and overcome difficulties.

In this round of epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai adheres to the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine and uses Chinese and Western medicines, and gives full play to the unique advantages of Chinese medicine in fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic.  What is the effect of traditional Chinese medicine? How to better treat elderly infection and improve the ability of patients with severe and critical illnesses? The reporter interviewed Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Honorary President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.  The effect is good for non -symptoms and mild infections after the intervention of traditional Chinese medicine  ""From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, the core disease of Omikon's mutant strain and the pathogenesis have not changed significantly compared with the previous strains, and still belong to the category of the disease of Chinese medicine."" The cause of the plant is to feel the epidemic. The number of asymptomatic infections and the high proportion are the obvious characteristics of the Shanghai this round of epidemic. On the one hand, it is related to the characteristics of Omikon's mutant strains. Its toxicity is relatively weakened and the clinical symptoms are relatively mild; on the other hand, it is related to timely screening in my country and early infected with infected people and extensive vaccination COVID-19 virus vaccines. Essence  ""For asymptomatic infections, Western medicine believes that there is no symptoms, and Chinese medicine believes that there is evidence."" Zhang Boli analyzed, such as some asymptomatic infected people, may have the symptoms of burnout, greasy tongue coating, and abdominal bloating. According to the ""New Coronatte Pneumonic Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Trial Ninth Edition)"", use ""three -party and three medicines"", plus Shanghai's proposed protocol medicine for treatment. From the perspective of the preliminary use, after using traditional Chinese medicine intervention in the asymptomatic and mild infection, it shows good effects in preventing the progress of the disease and the acceleration of the test results of nucleic acid testing.  Try to block the development of the elderly infected.  ""At present, 30 % of the elderly over 60 years old in hospitalization cases. Most elderly people have basic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, advanced tumors, etc."" Zhang Boli said, basic diseases and COVID-19 plus plus Together, it will lead to serious illness, and it is easy to turn into severe and critical illnesses. It needs to pay special attention.  ""The primary principle of treating elderly infected people is 'new and old diseases'."" Zhang Boli believes that it is not difficult to simply treat COVID-19, but it is mixed with unstable basic diseases, which is more difficult to treat. Therefore, while treating COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the treatment of basic diseases.  ""The second principle is to‘ righteousness and dispel evil ’.” Zhang Boli analyzed that the elderly often had basic disease evidence such as insufficient qi, viscera deficiency, and poor qi and blood. After infection with the COVID-19 virus, it was easy to increase quickly, and it was necessary to focus on treatment. During treatment, we must pay attention to ""righteousness"", protect ""righteous qi"", and use methods such as qi and promoting blood, nourishing qi and nourishing yin; focusing on ""clearing"" and ""passing"". Waiting for prescriptions.  ""The third principle is to treat the passport forward, symptoms, and cut off the disease."" Zhang Boli believes that the infected person is a process from non -symptoms to symptoms, and it is necessary to intervene early. For example, in clinical practice, although some elderly infected people seem to be ordinary, when the fever continues, unclear consciousness, phlegm sticky cough, and lungs without absorption, time must be treated.  Improve the ability of patients with critical illness and critical illness  At present, the number of cases of severe and critical illnesses in Shanghai has begun to increase, and the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine has also increased.  Zhang Boli introduced that Shanghai Organization has rich experience in infectious diseases. Shanghai famous Chinese medicine medicine and Qihuang scholars, etc., together with the national traditional Chinese medicine expert group to form a multi -disciplinary Chinese medicine expert group. , Comprehensively participate in the municipal -level Chinese and western medical experts joint inspection and consultation.  ""The treatment of patients with severe illnesses and critical illness is to emphasize multi -disciplinary cooperation."" Zhang Boli believes that the disciplines of severe medical sciences, respiratory, nutrition support, care, and traditional Chinese medicine must play their own advantages and collective efforts. Traditional Chinese and Western medicine combined, Chinese medicine, China Western medicines are used together to control the disease, reverse the disease, and reduce the disease.  Zhang Boli analyzes that according to factors such as basic diseases, the most dangerous factors for each case adopt the method of dialectical and targeted treatment strategies for each case. Specifically is a ""early"", a ""quasi"". Early discovery, early warning, early research, early judgment, early intervention; targeted precision treatment, ""one person, one policy, one person, one side, one party one party"". In terms of specific treatment, it is necessary to ""fast"", sometimes ""stable"", patiently observe the changes in symptoms, and stability is not worse. Sometimes it must be ""supported"".

How to look at the current epidemic prevention strategy? How to do precision prevention and control? The reporter interviewed Liang Wannian, the leader of the Expert Group of the State Health and Health Commission's epidemic response work.  Adhere to ""dynamic clearing zero"", maximize the protection of people's life safety and physical health  Since March, my country's epidemic has increased significantly, and the number of infections has increased rapidly. Some people have proposed that after the infection of Omircong strains, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infection is very high. Is the current epidemic prevention of ""big movement""?  ""It can be said certain that the current epidemic prevention and control is not a 'great movement."" Liang Wannian said that the severity of a virus must be comprehensively considered and the severe illness and death caused by the dissemination. Omikon's spread is much greater than the flu and the previous COVID-19 virus strains. In the absence of any protection measures, the average infected person can spread 9.5 people. From the perspective of disease mortality, the average mortality rate of the global influenza is 0.1%. Real world data shows that the average disease mortality rate of Omikon's mutant strains is about 0.75%, which is 7 to 8 times the flu. The mortality rate of the elderly people is more than 10%, which is nearly a hundred times that of ordinary flu.  Liang Wannian said that from the actual situation in China, the population of the elderly is huge, and the fragile and easy sense of children such as children. Once the epidemic is relaxed, a large number of people will be infected in the short term. People are panicked, causing medical resources to be crowded, and normal medical service needs cannot be resolved, forming a vicious circle.  Liang Wannian said that my country has always adhered to the concept of ""people's supremacy, life supremacy"", and has conditions and ability to adhere to ""dynamic clearing zero"". The connotation of ""dynamic clearing zero"" is to effectively identify and manage the source of infection, effectively cut off the channels of communication, and discover together and extinguish it together to prevent the epidemic from spreading community transmission and large -scale rebounds. Essence  Epidemic prevention is a systematic project.  The essence of ""dynamic clearance"" is fast and accurate. ""Faced with the characteristics of fast transmission, concealment, and short latent period of Omir Rong's mutant strains. The key to preventing and controlling epidemic is to be fast."" Liang Wannian said, how to do it faster? In fact, we are required to maintain a high degree of vigilance and strengthen the ability to respond to the public health system.  Once the epidemic is found, the enclosure should be quickly implemented and the epidemic dissemination should be controlled to the minimum range. To do this, not only should you quickly discover cases and transfer to treatment, but also preparations for beds, manpower, guarantee supplies, etc. are also fast, and running at faster speeds and viruses. Secondly, it is necessary to achieve precision, through nucleic acid detection and antigen self -test, effectively and quickly lock the infection, and implement accurate management.  During the prevention and control of the epidemic, some people's production and life was affected, and problems such as insufficient living materials were in place and poor daily medical channels. In this regard, Liang Wannian said that it is necessary to take measures to correct them in a timely manner, and to establish reforms. For example, it is necessary to effectively protect the needs of the masses to see a doctor for medical treatment, and epidemic prevention measures must also be more humane and temperature.  ""Epidemic prevention is a systematic project."" Liang Wannian said that the prevention and control of the epidemic is not only a matter for the government, but also a matter of the whole society and individuals. It involves all aspects. The relationship between.  Further make good preparations in all aspects  ""It has not yet reached the stage of preventing and controlling prevention and control."" Liang Wannian emphasized that the prevention and control measures of the epidemic are based on the scientific understanding of the virus, the characteristics of the epidemic, the scope of the epidemic situation, and the resistance we have.  Liang Wannian said that practice has proved that vaccination is very effective for preventing severe illnesses and death. At present, the vaccination rate of the elderly and children is not high enough, and it is necessary to further increase the vaccination rate of fragile people such as the elderly. Secondly, Omikon's mutant strains are not the last mutant strains, which is the consensus of the international scientific community. It is necessary to continue to pay attention to and study the spread of mutation plants, the pathogenesis, etc. in order to effectively adjust the epidemic prevention measures.  At present, Omikon may still be the main popular strains we are facing. In response to the characteristics of Omikon, local governments must be prepared, including medical resources such as nucleic acid detection capabilities, beds such as beds, human resources, emergency management mechanisms, as well as living materials supply and community management under the prevention and control of the epidemic.  ""Unified thoughts, firm confidence, and fully prepared, we must be able to defeat the covid-19 epidemic."" Liang Wannian said.",The epidemic prevention and control; ,True

On April 21, President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the Boao Asia Forum in the 2022 Annual Meeting in a video. Based on the moment and in the long run, President Xi Jinping puts forward four claims for the changes of the world, the changes of the times, and the changes of history for all human beings. Among them, ""we must jointly protect human life and health together"" to deepen cooperation between countries and cooperate with each other, improve global public health governance, and jointly promote the direction of the guidance of the construction of human health and health community.  Strengthen mutual support  Formation of anti -epidemic  At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is still repeatedly delayed globally, and the uneven distribution of vaccines, and the continuous mutation of the virus, which greatly hinders the pace of the global epidemic prevention and control, and shadow the world economic recovery. Human beings have completely defeated the Covid-19 epidemic.  This is a century test and a world test. Faced with the test of this fate of human beings, where should countries go?  In the general trend of the pulse era, President Xi Jinping clarified China's claim- ""Rushing out of the fog towards light, the most powerful force is the same force, the most effective way is to help with sincerity."" Governance and form a strong international joint force to cope with the epidemic. ""  The epidemic reminds us that there are still shortcomings and loopholes in the global health governance system, and it is imminent to strengthen the construction of global public health governance capabilities. It is necessary to strengthen and play the role of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, improve the global disease prevention and control system, and better prevent and cope with the future epidemic. We must adhere to the co -discussion and sharing, fully listen to the opinions of developing countries, and better reflect the reasonable demands of developing countries. It is necessary to improve monitoring and early warning and emergency response capabilities, major epidemic treatment capabilities, emergency material reserves and guarantee capabilities, cracking down on false information capabilities, and support capabilities to developing countries.  The epidemic reminds us that in the rough waves of the global crisis, countries ride on a large ship of fate and Communist Party. President Xi Jinping pointed out many times that the emergencies similar to the COVID-19 epidemic will never be the last time. If you want to solve the difficulties, you must carry out global actions, global response, and global cooperation. The international community adheres to the concept of the community of human destiny, and adheres to the road of multilateralism and the combination of groups in order to deal with various global issues and build a beautiful earth home.  ""Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping's vision and strong and powerful, China is accelerating the development of all aspects and conveying a signal of lasting peace and stability and common prosperity to the world."" At the annual meeting of the Boao Asia Forum, Nepal President Bandari China actively provides anti -epidemic support to all parties. ""In today's era, countries must unite and cooperate and support each other in order to properly cope with global challenges and solve global problems.""  ""At the moment when the global economy and security facing multiple challenges, President Xi Jinping pointed out the direction for the rushing out of the fog towards all countries."" Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the American Institute of International Institute of International Institute of International Issues, believes that China has explained again through the platform of the Boao Forum for Asia. The relationship between resistance and development, ""Only by strengthening cooperation, forming consensus, and cohesion can we obtain a powerful momentum that supports the recovery of Asia and the global economic recovery.""  Fairly allocated vaccine  Slow  Vaccine is a powerful weapon to defeat the epidemic and restore the economy. President Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to adhere to the attributes of vaccines as a global public product and ensure the accessability and burden of vaccine in developing countries.  At the annual meeting of this forum, the relevant parties further summarized global anti -epidemic experience, promoted vaccine cooperation, and built a global ""immune barrier"". On the sub -forum with the theme of ""Reducing 'Immune Glutology"" and sharing health and well -being, international organization representatives and public health experts generally expressed concerns about the current global vaccine distribution. People have not been vaccinated, and the data in Africa is as high as 83%; among the low-income countries, only less than half of the population vaccines, and more than 80%of the developed countries have vaccinated ... COVID-19 vaccine countries are prepared Ted Chai Ban, the global chief coordinator of the delivery work, emphasized that countries should be committed to strengthening cooperation and allowing more people to vaccinate. ""China has played a very important role in vaccine delivery and fundraising Information and technical support "".  The fairness of global vaccines is the common expectations of the people of the world, and it is also an important issue for China to actively promote international anti -epidemic cooperation. In response to the increasingly prominent problem of unbalanced vaccination in the world, President Xi Jinping has clearly stated that it is necessary to abandon the ""vaccine nationalism"" and solve the problem of vaccine capacity and distribution.  Adhering to the concept of the community of human health and health, China advocates and actively practiced the global vaccine cooperation operation. The earliest promised to use the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public product. The earliest support for vaccine intellectual property exemption, and the earliest vaccine production cooperation with developing countries. At present, China has successively transferred technologies to more than 20 countries and cooperated with vaccines, and a 1 billion dose of COVID-19 vaccine has been formed overseas. These actions are real, strongly leading international anti -epidemic cooperation, and contributing Chinese power to any country ""falling behind"" and to crack ""distribution of deficit"".  In February this year, relying on Chinese vaccines in localized production projects in Egypt, China -Egypt jointly assisted 500,000 doses of vaccines to Gaza. Mohammed Hassonny, deputy minister of Health of the Egyptian Ministry of Health, proudly stated that Egypt China ""created an example of anti -epidemic cooperation"" and ""China actively provides vaccine assistance to other countries. The rate can reach 70%. ""  ""We need to promote the equality of vaccination and protect the most vulnerable crowd under the epidemic. This is an important issue facing the world. In this regard, China has given a lot of support and made great contributions."" The Red Cross and Red New The Secretary -General of the Month of the Monthly Confederation, Jobaguki, emphasized.  Persist in life first  Demonstrate China's responsibility  ""Thank you very much for China for help"", ""China is a friendly neighborhood"", ""Thank you sincerely for China"" ... At this annual meeting of this forum, ""thanks"" became a high -frequency word for the representatives of the meeting. During his speech, the leaders of many countries and the heads of international organizations personally promoted President Xi Jinping to express their respect for international cooperation against immunity, and appreciated China's great efforts to promote the construction of human health community.  The safety of people's lives and health is the prerequisite for human development and progress. From adhering to the concept of people's supremacy and life first, to global development initiative to include resistance and vaccines in the eight key cooperation areas, the pace of united parties in unity in cooperation with against the disease and overwhelming time has never stopped. In the complicated international situation, China is responsible and provides comprehensive support for developing countries.  President Xi Jinping pointed out that China has provided more than 2.1 billion vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Regardless of whether it is vaccine or overseas vaccine, China must believe in and act. China will continue to assist 600 million doses and 150 million doses of vaccines in Africa and ASEAN, respectively, and make positive efforts to bridge the ""immune gap"".  At present, more than 60 countries around the world have mainly used Chinese vaccines to deal with epidemic conditions. Among the top 10 countries with the total global vaccination and the top 10 per capita vaccination volume, half of the Chinese vaccine is the main force. Developing countries are the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese vaccines. The first batch of vaccines received by many developing countries are from China, and most of the vaccines obtained so far are also from China. At the same time, China and more than 10 countries and international and regional organizations sharing epidemic prevention and control and diagnosis and treatment plans, submitted to the World Health Organization for the ""Research Report on the COVID-19 Evidence-based Evolution Evaluation Research"" to the World Health Organization; Expert group; provided about 372 billion masks, more than 4.2 billion protective clothing, 8.4 billion test agents ...  Chen Fengfuzhen, Director of Honor of the World Health Organization and Chairman of the Global Health Forum of the Boao Forum, said that China is doing everything they can do, not only protecting its own citizens, but also as much as possible to contribute to the world.

544,"""Dynamic clearing zero"" is the anti -epidemic strategy with the lowest cost of social costs ",仲音;,2,4/24/22,259,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruVkbi1Ty497xXEVR3m9evJdH9fKeDT_f7crKrpwKJ7JYRd70a1DoODLyZRa2JdUG0jQsCx0NETFkct4OECwHedPYmIj2CKE8Rv-3fW-EBVR3hTwwQMlOrMZ&uniplatform=NZKPT,"Recently, the national epidemic situation has gradually stabilized, but the intersection input between regions is significantly impact, and the dynamic zero mission in various places is still very difficult. The more at this time, the more you must be soberly realized that the dynamic clearance is the most comprehensive social cost resistance strategy, which is the best choice based on the current situation of China's epidemic situation. loss.  It should be seen that dynamic clearing is not to require ""zero infection"", but to quickly and accurately cut the spread chain to the COVID-19 epidemic. It does not allow the virus to cause sustainable community transmission and a large-scale epidemic rebound. From a scientific perspective, the dissemination scene of the COVID-19 virus is very extensive and the transmission pathway is very complicated. As the virus continues to mutate, the propagation is high. The disease is easy to identify and diagnose. The pursuit of less infection, rather than ""zero infection"" means that once an epidemic occurs, early discovery, quickly enclosure, and cut off spread, which reflects respect for science and respect, and can minimize the impact of epidemic on economic and social development.  If you prepare everything from disadvantages, and strive to strive for the best results, you can be prepared to be unpareural, not panic, and firmly grasp the initiative. Omikon's mutant strains are aggressive, and we must never estimate the consequences caused by its popularity. From the characteristics of the virus itself, the mutant strain of Omikon is not a ""large flu"". It has strong infectiousness, fast transmission speed, high hiddenness, and large number of infections. Serious threats cannot be underestimated. From the perspective of the realistic national conditions of our country, on the one hand, my country has more than 1.4 billion people, and the population of 60 and above is 267 million. The population base is large and the number of elderly groups is large. There are imbalances between vaccine vaccination between different people. If you choose ""lying flat"", let the virus popular and spread a large -scale spread, regardless of ""defense"", only ""govern"", it will inevitably increase the risk of infection of susceptible people. , Serious losses in property, the final price will be huge. Persist in dynamic clearance, based on early grasping, small, and grasping the foundation. If you find it together, you can control the epidemic at the lowest social cost and in the shortest time, and firmly grasp the initiative of war ""epidemic"".  The ""tube"" for a while is to better ""put"". In the short term, strict prevention and control measures for the fierce epidemic will inevitably affect the economic and social development and the mass production and life of the people. Management is to promote healthier and lasting development. It must be soberly realized that only if the epidemic is effectively controlled, economic development and normal life can have favorable conditions; the sooner the epidemic is controlled, the smaller the affected economic development. On the other hand, some countries have continued to deteriorate after the announcement of the implementation of the ""Coexistence with COVID-19"", which eventually impacted all aspects of economic and social life: people who did not work or are looking for jobs due to poor long-term health conditions increased by 20 Wan; 1/4 company in the country said that the COVID-19 epidemic is a major reason for the shortage of corporate employees. This also shows that in the face of Omikon's mutation, ""lying flat"" is not advisable, and ""lying to win"" is impossible. If you do not control the epidemic in a timely manner, the impact on the economy and society will only be greater; insisting on dynamic clearing zero, you can ensure the sustainable and stable development of the economy and society with good prevention and control results.  Fighting with the epidemic is the wrestling of material and the spiritual confrontation; it is a contest of strength and a context. Adhering to the ""dynamic clearing zero"" general policy of not hesitation, the zero -tackling operation of the Shanghai society has achieved important stages of results; Jilin Province announced that cities and states have achieved zero targets, and the scenes of spring farming on black and soil have returned. After 7 days of ""slow life"" in Shenzhen, Shenzhen has realized the dynamic clearance of society. The city's industrial chain supply chain is steadily ""returning"" ... The results of the epidemic prevention and control have fully proved that the dynamic clearing zero meets national conditions and is in line with national conditions. Science, effective and feasible. Maintain strategic determination, grasp the ""epidemic"" in one hand, grasp the development of one hand, take effective measures, and accumulate the victory as a big victory, we will be able to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the minimum cost, realize the prevention and control of epidemic, and economic and social development at the minimum cost, and to achieve the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development.

""Asia Governor of Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun, said in an interview with this reporter recently.  At present, the COVID-19 epidemic has continued to repeat, and the world situation has evolved complicatedly, which constitutes a major challenge to global development. Golden Liqun believes that the annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia will continue to provide people from all walks of life with a high -level dialogue platform that discusses major issues such as economic, social, and environment. Important and unique role.  ""As an international financial institution advocated by China, the AIIB has always worked hard in accordance with the original intention of President Xi Jinping's initiative to interpret the meaning of multilateralism and human destiny community with practical actions, and has been highly recognized by all parties.

The annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia focuses on the topic of world economic recovery and sustainable development after the epidemic. According to Jin Liqun, in the face of the epidemic challenge, while the AIIB continued to promote sustainable development and interconnection of infrastructure, it actively helped members to cope with the public health crisis and promote economic recovery. In March of this year, the COVID-19 epidemic crisis recovery fund financing application period established by the AIIB at the beginning of the epidemic has been extended to the end of 2023, and the scale has expanded to 20 billion US dollars. The impact of economic and financial systems provides fast financial support. As of now, the AIIB has approved 48 financing projects with a total of more than 11.6 billion US dollars under this special fund to benefit 25 members of the Asian region and out -of -domain members.  As a multilateral development institution headquartered in China, the AIIB has never forgotten to provide support for China's economic and social development. In July of last year, there was a big flood in many places in Henan, China. The AIIB's heart was in the disaster area. It only took more than 3 months to approve an emergency loan of $ 1 billion to support Henan to speed up post -disaster reconstruction and enhance the sustainability and climate change of infrastructure.

Golden Liqun said that the global development initiative, the ""Belt and Road"" and the AIIB are important embodiment and practice of the concept of the human destiny community and the joint construction and sharing of the global governance concept. In the context of the current international community's urgent need to fight against the epidemic, revitalize the global economy, and respond to climate change, the above -mentioned initiative and institutions will play an important role in further deepening international cooperation and narrowing global governance deficit.

In terms of formula, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech in a video manner, solemnly announced that we need to protect the health of human life, promote economic recovery, jointly maintain the world peace and peace, and respond to the challenges of global governance. Global security initiative with the Communist Party. President Xi Jinping's keynote speech was far -sighted, profound, and rich in connotation. He contributed China's wisdom and pointed out the direction of efforts to global unity and cooperation.  The theme of the Boao Forum for Asia in 2022 will be of the theme of ""epidemic and world: promoting global development and building a common future"". It is of great significance. At present, the changes of the world, the changes of the times, and the changes in history are unfolding in an unprecedented way, which gives humans a challenge that must be treated seriously. It should be seen that human beings have not gone out of the haze of the century and faced new traditional security risks; the global economic recovery is still fragile and weak, and the contradiction between the development of development of development; In front of us. Throughout history, human beings grow up in the victory over and over the test and develop in a crisis in a crisis. Any difficult twists and turns can stop the wheels of history. The more difficult moments, the more we need to strengthen their confidence, progress and bravely, take the right way of peaceful development, and win -win cooperation, and continue to move towards the correct direction of building a community of human destiny.  Over the past two years, the international community has made hard work to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic challenge and promote the development of the world economic recovery. Difficulties and challenges further tell us that humans are the community of fate of the Communist Party. All countries must conform to the trend of peace, development, cooperation, and win -win situations, and bravely defeat various dangers on the road of forward. It is necessary to soberly realize that the safety of people's lives and physical health are the prerequisite for human development and progress. Only countries can only support each other, strengthen the coordination of epidemic prevention measures, improve global public health governance, and form a strong international joint force to respond to the epidemic. 19 The epidemic has a significant impact on the results of global poverty reduction in the past 10 years. Only by adhering to the construction of an open world economy, grasping the general development trend of economic globalization, and promoting global balance, coordination, and tolerance can we promote the recovery of the world economy. Security is the prerequisite for development. Human beings are an inseparable security community. Only by steadily promoting the implementation of global security initiatives can the implementation of the global security initiative can promote world security and the Communist Party. future.

At the same time, the trend of multi -poleization in the world has not fundamentally changed. Economic globalization shows new toughness, and the voices of maintaining multilateralism and strengthening communication and cooperation are stronger. The development of the international community has become a complicated, exquisite, organic integrated machine to this day. Disasterning of a component will make the entire machine's operations facing serious difficulties, the demolished person will be damaged, and the dismantling person will be damaged.

尊敬的各位国际组织负责人，
尊敬的各位博鳌亚洲论坛理事，
各位来宾，
女士们，先生们，朋友们：
很高兴同各位新老朋友再次在“云端”相聚，共同出席博鳌亚洲论坛2022年年会。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，对出席年会的嘉宾，表示诚挚的欢迎！对年会的召开，表示热烈的祝贺！
当下，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开，给人类提出了必须严肃对待的挑战。人类还未走出世纪疫情阴霾，又面临新的传统安全风险；全球经济复苏仍脆弱乏力，又叠加发展鸿沟加剧的矛盾；气候变化等治理赤字尚未填补，数字治理等新课题又摆在我们面前。在这样的背景下，论坛年会以“疫情与世界：共促全球发展，构建共同未来”为主题，具有重要意义。
“安危不贰其志，险易不革其心。”人类历史告诉我们，越是困难时刻，越要坚定信心。矛盾并不可怕，正是矛盾推动着人类社会进步。任何艰难曲折都不能阻挡历史前进的车轮。面对重重挑战，我们决不能丧失信心、犹疑退缩，而是要坚定信心、激流勇进。
女士们、先生们、朋友们！
冲出迷雾走向光明，最强大的力量是同心合力，最有效的方法是和衷共济。过去两年多来，国际社会为应对新冠肺炎疫情挑战、推动世界经济复苏发展作出了艰苦努力。困难和挑战进一步告诉我们，人类是休戚与共的命运共同体，各国要顺应和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流，向着构建人类命运共同体的正确方向，携手迎接挑战、合作开创未来。
——我们要共同守护人类生命健康。人民生命安全和身体健康是人类发展进步的前提。人类彻底战胜新冠肺炎疫情还需付出艰苦努力。各国要相互支持，加强防疫措施协调，完善全球公共卫生治理，形成应对疫情的强大国际合力。要坚持疫苗作为全球公共产品的属性，确保疫苗在发展中国家的可及性和可负担性。中国已经向120多个国家和国际组织提供超过21亿剂疫苗。无论是对外提供疫苗还是海外生产疫苗，中国都言必信、行必果。中国将继续向非洲、东盟分别援助6亿剂、1.5亿剂疫苗，为弥合“免疫鸿沟”作出积极努力。
——我们要共同促进经济复苏。新冠肺炎疫情对过去10年全球减贫成果造成重大冲击，复苏不均衡加剧全球不平等，南北鸿沟持续扩大。我们要坚持建设开放型世界经济，把握经济全球化发展大势，加强宏观政策协调，运用科技增强动能，维护全球产业链供应链稳定，防止一些国家政策调整产生严重负面外溢效应，促进全球平衡、协调、包容发展。要坚持以人民为中心，把促进发展、保障民生置于突出位置，实施政策、采取措施、开展行动都要把是否有利于民生福祉放在第一位。要关注发展中国家紧迫需求，围绕减贫、粮食安全、发展筹资、工业化等重点领域推进务实合作，着力解决发展不平衡不充分问题。去年，我提出了全球发展倡议，得到联合国等国际组织和近百个国家响应和支持。我们正在同国际社会一道，稳步推进倡议落地落实。
——我们要共同维护世界和平安宁。“治国常富，而乱国常贫。”安全是发展的前提，人类是不可分割的安全共同体。事实再次证明，冷战思维只会破坏全球和平框架，霸权主义和强权政治只会危害世界和平，集团对抗只会加剧21世纪安全挑战。为了促进世界安危与共，中方愿在此提出全球安全倡议：我们要坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，共同维护世界和平和安全；坚持尊重各国主权、领土完整，不干涉别国内政，尊重各国人民自主选择的发展道路和社会制度；坚持遵守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，摒弃冷战思维，反对单边主义，不搞集团政治和阵营对抗；坚持重视各国合理安全关切，秉持安全不可分割原则，构建均衡、有效、可持续的安全架构，反对把本国安全建立在他国不安全的基础之上；坚持通过对话协商以和平方式解决国家间的分歧和争端，支持一切有利于和平解决危机的努力，不能搞双重标准，反对滥用单边制裁和“长臂管辖”；坚持统筹维护传统领域和非传统领域安全，共同应对地区争端和恐怖主义、气候变化、网络安全、生物安全等全球性问题。
——我们要共同应对全球治理挑战。世界各国乘坐在一条命运与共的大船上，要穿越惊涛骇浪、驶向光明未来，必须同舟共济，企图把谁扔下大海都是不可接受的。国际社会发展到今天已经成为一部复杂精巧、有机一体的机器，拆掉一个零部件就会使整个机器运转面临严重困难，被拆的人会受损，拆的人也会受损。当今世界，任何单边主义、极端利己主义都是根本行不通的，任何脱钩、断供、极限施压的行径都是根本行不通的，任何搞“小圈子”、以意识形态划线挑动对立对抗也都是根本行不通的。我们要践行共商共建共享的全球治理观，弘扬全人类共同价值，倡导不同文明交流互鉴。要坚持真正的多边主义，坚定维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序。大国尤其要作出表率，带头讲平等、讲合作、讲诚信、讲法治，展现大国的样子。
女士们、先生们、朋友们！
亚洲人民历经热战冷战，饱经沧桑忧患，深知和平弥足珍贵，发展来之不易。过去几十年，亚洲地区总体保持稳定，经济持续快速增长，成就了“亚洲奇迹”。亚洲好世界才能更好。我们要继续把亚洲发展好、建设好，展现亚洲的韧性、智慧、力量，打造世界的和平稳定锚、增长动力源、合作新高地。
第一，坚定维护亚洲和平。地区和平稳定不是天上掉下来的，也不是哪个国家的施舍，而是地区国家共同努力的成果。今天，亚洲首倡的和平共处五项原则和“万隆精神”更加具有现实意义。我们要秉持相互尊重、平等互利、和平共处等原则，奉行睦邻友好政策，把命运牢牢掌握在自己手中。
第二，积极推动亚洲合作。亚洲国家谚语说，“遇山一起爬，遇沟一起跨”、“甘蔗同穴生，香茅成丛长”。共赢合作是亚洲发展的必由之路。《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》正式生效，中老铁路建成通车，有效提升了地区硬联通、软联通水平。我们要以此为契机，推动亚洲形成更加开放的大市场，促进亚洲共赢合作迈出新步伐。
第三，共同促进亚洲团结。用对话合作取代零和博弈，用开放包容取代封闭排他，用交流互鉴取代唯我独尊，这是亚洲应有的襟怀和气度。我们要巩固东盟在地区架构中的中心地位，维护兼顾各方诉求、包容各方利益的区域秩序。国家无论大小强弱，无论域内域外，都应该为亚洲添彩而不添乱，都要共走和平发展大道，共谋合作共赢大计，共创团结进步的亚洲大家庭。
女士们、先生们、朋友们！
两个多月前，中国向世界奉献了简约、安全、精彩的北京冬奥会、冬残奥会，为各国人民带来了温暖和希望。下半年，我们将召开中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会，擘画中国未来发展蓝图。
中国经济韧性强、潜力足、回旋余地广、长期向好的基本面不会改变，将为世界经济企稳复苏提供强大动能，为各国提供更广阔的市场机会。中国将全面贯彻新发展理念，加快构建新发展格局，着力推动高质量发展。不论世界发生什么样的变化，中国改革开放的信心和意志都不会动摇。中国将扩大高水平对外开放，深入实施外资准入负面清单，扩大鼓励外商投资范围，优化外资促进服务，增设服务业扩大开放综合试点。中国将扎实推进自由贸易试验区、海南自由贸易港建设，对接国际高标准经贸规则，推动制度型开放。中国将全面实施《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》，推动同更多国家和地区商签高标准自由贸易协定，积极推进加入《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》和《数字经济伙伴关系协定》。中国将坚持高标准、可持续、惠民生的目标，积极推进高质量共建“一带一路”。中国将始终不渝坚持走和平发展道路，始终做世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者。
女士们、先生们、朋友们！
中国古人说，日日行，不怕千万里；常常做，不怕千万事。只要我们携手同心、行而不辍，就一定能汇聚起合作共赢的伟力，战胜前进道路上的各种挑战，迎来人类更加光明美好的未来。
谢谢大家。

我国经济长期向好基本面没有改变，经济持续恢复态势没有改变，发展潜力大、韧性足、空间广的特点也没有改变
4月18日，中国经济首季报出炉。初步核算，一季度国内生产总值270178亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长4.8%，比2021年四季度环比增长1.3%。主要宏观指标保持在合理区间，其中CPI同比上涨1.1%，全国居民人均可支配收入同比名义增长6.3%，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.5%，货物进出口总额94151亿元，同比增长10.7%。面对百年变局与世纪疫情交织叠加，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，各地区各部门统筹做好疫情防控和经济社会发展，坚持稳字当头、稳中求进，国民经济延续恢复发展态势，经济运行总体平稳。一季度经济“开门稳”，再次证明了“中国经济韧性强、潜力足、长期向好的基本面没有改变”，我们仍要坚定不移做好自己的事情，不断做强经济基础。
从开年“成绩单”看中国经济走势，我们充满信心。今年以来，国际形势更趋复杂严峻，国内疫情也呈现点多、面广、频发的特点，对经济运行的冲击影响加大。我们顶住压力，把稳增长放在更加突出位置，爬坡过坎、主动作为，整体上稳定住了宏观经济大盘，保持经济运行在合理区间。同时，高质量发展迈出新步伐，一季度，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，高技术制造业增加值增长14.2%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值同比增长10.8%。当前，稳定的产业链供应链，超大规模的国内市场和强大的内需潜力，拥有巨大优势和潜能的科技创新，共同支撑起中国经济的强大韧性，构筑起我们的信心底气。
经济整体韧性强，体现在产业链供应链稳定可靠。推动供给侧保企业生产、稳中国制造，是应对风险挑战的重要举措，更是着眼长远、赢得发展主动权的重要手段。去年以来，国家级制造业创新中心布局建设，产业基础再造工程实施，关键产业链补链强链专项行动开展，一大批“链主”企业和“专精特新”中小企业加速崛起。一季度，农业（种植业）增加值同比增长4.8%，市场供应充足，煤炭产量持续高位稳定运行，价格稳步回落，国家铁路货物发送量完成9.48亿吨，同比增长2.8%。受疫情影响，近期局部供应链不畅，从中央到地方发力“民生要托底、货运要畅通、产业要循环”。维护好产业链供应链稳定安全，为抗击疫情和恢复经济提供保障，我们有政策、有预案，有基础、有成效。
经济整体韧性强，体现在市场和内需的潜力巨大。我国具有扩大内需的独特优势，拥有包括4亿多中等收入群体在内的14亿多人口所形成的超大规模内需市场，需求层次丰富，规模优势显著。一季度，城乡居民人均收入比值比上年同期缩小0.04，全国居民人均消费支出6393元，比上年名义增长6.9%，促进消费仍有较大潜力；全国固定资产投资（不含农户）同比增长9.3%，其中采矿业投资增长19.0%，制造业投资增长15.6%。加快建设高效规范、公平竞争、充分开放的全国统一大市场，打通生产、分配、流通、消费各环节，畅通国民经济循环，积极扩大有效投资，综合施策释放消费潜力，内需对经济增长的拉动力定会更加强劲。
经济整体韧性强，还体现在创新驱动发展的新动能。科技创新一边为企业赋能，一边给市场助力，提高供给体系质量和水平，以新供给创造新需求。今年货币政策创设科技创新专项再贷款，财政政策聚焦制造业、科技创新给予税费支持，多地组织实施重点实验室建设。一季度科技创新释放新动能，信息服务业、科技成果转化服务业投资分别增长21.3%、19.0%，新能源汽车、太阳能电池、工业机器人产量分别增长140.8%、24.3%、10.2%。把促进科技创新和产业升级的政策落实落细，坚定不移深化“放管服”改革，就能更大程度激发市场活力和发展内生动力，巩固壮大实体经济根基。
惟其艰难，才更显勇毅；惟其笃行，才弥足珍贵。越是困难越要坚定信心、真抓实干。我国经济长期向好基本面没有改变，经济持续恢复态势没有改变，发展潜力大、韧性足、空间广的特点也没有改变。统筹好疫情防控和经济社会发展，稳字当头、稳中求进，我们一定能战胜内外部风险挑战，实现预期目标任务，以实际行动迎接党的二十大胜利召开。

这支中国医疗队来自重庆，2020年12月抵达巴巴多斯后，在当地最大、历史最悠久的公立医院—伊丽莎白女王医院开始工作。医疗队的8名医生和护士来自心血管内科、血管外科、骨科、中医科等科室，分别担任顾问医生和护理临床实践指导专家。
自2016年底中国首次向巴巴多斯派遣援外医疗队以来，中巴医疗合作不断深化。新冠肺炎疫情防控期间，双方展开多种形式的抗疫合作。第五批援巴医疗队出发前，应巴方要求，几家担负援外任务的中方医院与巴相关部门举行抗疫经验交流视频会，分享防疫经验和诊疗方案。临出发前，中方所有队员专门就新冠肺炎的诊治和防控等进行了系统性学习，并进行多次实操演练，为在巴顺利开展工作做好了充足准备。
去年6月，中国援助巴巴多斯的3万剂国药疫苗抵达该国。巴方主动邀请中国医疗队加入疫苗接种的各环节，保障了接种的顺利完成。巴巴多斯全国新冠疫苗接种运动联合协调员费迪南德对中国医疗队的表现印象深刻：“他们的工作非常出色。有了他们的帮助，疫苗接种流程能够更高效、顺利地完成。”
疫情防控期间，中国医疗队队员与当地医护人员一起坚守岗位，保证了医院的正常运转。伊丽莎白女王医院的介入手术室里，一台微创下肢静脉曲张手术正在进行。“以脉冲的方式推注泡沫硬化剂，肉眼或超声观察到泡沫充满管腔即停止注射。”手术中，主刀的中国医生刘洪不时向一旁观摩的巴方医生讲解手术的步骤和注意事项。
骨科肩关节镜手术、中西医联合诊治膝关节骨关节炎、超声引导连续神经阻滞术后镇痛、肌骨超声……中国医疗队不仅为巴巴多斯带来了抗疫物资和经验，也在当地开创了多项临床技术的应用。一位当地医生说，非常感谢医疗队带来的新技术，造福了当地的广大患者，也进一步提高了当地的医疗水平。许多当地医生希望能有机会到中国学习新技术。
中方医疗队队员们在临床工作中做好自身防护，保持全队零感染的同时，也经常叮嘱巴方同事做好防护。中国医疗队队长张群霞说，每天与巴方同事一起工作，就算隔着口罩和防护服，也能感受到彼此的心靠得越来越近。当地放射科技师加布里埃尔说：“中国医生的笑容是在疫情阴影笼罩下的一缕温暖阳光。”
伊丽莎白女王医院医疗服务中心主任克莱德·凯夫表示，巴中携手合作，为推动巴巴多斯抗击疫情作出重要贡献。未来，期待了解和借鉴中方更多的成功防疫经验，更好地保护巴巴多斯人民生命健康。

新冠肺炎疫情发生之初，塞尔维亚因医疗条件所限，抗疫工作一度遇到困难。关键时刻，中国伸出援手，除了提供抗疫物资、派遣抗疫医疗专家组，还为当地提供先进的抗疫设备作为技术支持。
2020年4月8日，塞尔维亚政府同中国华大集团线上签约，决定建设两座“火眼”实验室。据华大集团国际发展事务副总裁、塞尔维亚“火眼”实验室负责人熊韬介绍，“火眼”实验室是采用中国技术的高通量核酸检测实验室，达到生物安全防护二级实验室的标准，对于新冠病毒的检测速度快，准确度高，有助于及早发现病毒携带者。贝尔格莱德实验室的核心设备、尼什实验室的全部设备均由中国慈善机构和企业捐赠。
曾全程见证中方援建当地“火眼”实验室的塞尔维亚国家分子遗传学和基因工程研究所所长贝戈维奇说，得益于中国的帮助，塞尔维亚拥有了地区最先进的同类实验室。一台来自中国的自动化核酸提取仪，相当于10名熟练的实验室技术员，能够在节省人工并避免失误的同时，大大提高检测效率，最大程度保护检测人员安全，这对抗击新冠肺炎疫情以及应对此后可能发生的流行病起到巨大帮助。
在实验室落成初期，6名中方人员与40余名塞方检测人员并肩战斗，以轮班倒的形式每天工作16个小时。回忆过往，贝戈维奇说，永远不会忘记和中国同事一起在实验室夜以继日忙碌的日子。“火眼”实验室塞方工作人员玛雅说：“我们向中国同事学习，与他们交流经验，一起用技术和专业为抗疫作出贡献。”
“火眼”实验室启用后，两座实验室合计检测能力达每天3000份样本，为塞尔维亚抗击疫情发挥巨大作用。在实验室中方建设团队即将回国之际，塞尔维亚总统武契奇亲自接见了团队成员，并称赞中国给了塞尔维亚抗击疫情的信心和勇气。去年2月，武契奇还向中国政府赴塞尔维亚抗疫专家组和华大“火眼”实验室建设团队授勋，以感谢他们在塞尔维亚抗疫工作中作出的贡献。
塞尔维亚总理布尔纳比奇曾表示：“从塞尔维亚抗击疫情的第一天起，我们就得到中方宝贵的物资、专家、技术、经验等方方面面支持和帮助，可以说，没有中方的帮助，塞将无法战胜疫情。”
当前，中塞抗疫合作继续走向深入。去年12月，塞尔维亚基因测序和生物信息中心落成，该中心由华大基因和塞尔维亚国家分子遗传学和基因工程研究所合作建设，将有效提高该国新冠病毒变异株检测能力，并对新变异进行研究和监测，助力该国精准防控疫情。同时，该中心还将在母婴健康、癌症筛查、传染病防控等领域开展研究和应用，有力推动塞生物技术和生物经济发展。此外，位于贝尔格莱德的国药新冠疫苗工厂建设目前已进入最后阶段，今年完全建成后将实现月产能300万剂疫苗，满足该国和地区需要。

去年11月26日，这个中国医疗专家组抵达万象，在当地开始为期6个月的医疗援助工作，包括医疗保障、临床带教、科普讲座等。他们凭借丰富的疫情防控经验，因地制宜帮助当地升级防控和救治方案，提升技术水平和应对能力。“中国的帮助让老挝对抗击疫情充满信心。”老挝老中友协秘书长西昆说。
疫情发生以来，中国政府和军队已向老挝派遣多批医疗专家，援助多批抗疫物资和疫苗，累计向老挝援助疫苗超过890万剂。今年1月25日，中国政府援助老挝新一批新冠疫苗运抵万象机场。老挝政府总理潘坎在疫苗交接时说，正是在中国的帮助下，老挝才能超额完成2021年接种任务，并有信心实现2022年接种目标。
近期，老挝发生新一轮疫情。老挝政府全面加强防控，在全国增设隔离诊疗中心，同时加快推进疫苗接种。在老挝的中国医疗专家组也投入到紧张的抗疫工作中：顶着烈日，他们深入社区和隔离点，提出具体防控建议，以期实现有序有度精准防控；赴老挝重点核酸实验室进行交流，分享中方经验；走访采样点，针对当地在采样、信息登记、数据传输、人群风险研判等工作环节，提出完善建议……
老挝卫生部部长本丰表示，老挝疫情防控工作面临的困难主要是医疗物资和设施匮乏。中国无偿援助疫苗，援建核酸检测实验室，提供大量物资援助，为老挝疫情防控发挥不可替代的关键作用，老挝衷心感谢中国人民无私援助和有力支持。老挝民众也表达了对中国医疗援助的感激和对两国友好关系的支持。万象市民苯平说：“衷心感谢中国为老挝提供及时而宝贵的支援，中国的帮助一定能让老挝战胜疫情，让这里的生活早日回归正常!”
面对疫情，只有加强国际合作，才能有力维护各国人民健康安全和保障经济社会发展。潘坎表示，老挝和中国是命运共同体，老挝将加强与中国在制药、医护、技术等方面的沟通协调与交流合作，推动国际抗疫合作，共同提升地区卫生安全能力，为推动人类卫生健康共同体建设作出积极贡献。

3月24日起，位于嘉定区安亭镇的上汽集团设计中心开始封闭管理生产，62名员工花了三周时间，把原先耽误的工作进度抢了回来，完成荣威、飞凡、名爵3个品牌十几款车型的阶段性模型评审工作，为车型进入硬质模型阶段打下基础。
作为国家级工业设计中心，上汽大通用最短时间设计制造了上汽大通MAXUS V90核酸检测车等，首批40台已陆续交付上海市疾控中心和12个区疾控中心，在样品检测、运输等环节发挥了重要作用。
子夜，上海国际医学园区，荻硕贝肯医学检验所灯火通明，董事长郑仲征与广东省援沪医疗队核酸检测20人小分队一一道别，他们已经在这里奋战了两周时间。接替他们的是安徽省援沪医疗队。面对来势汹汹的疫情，荻硕贝肯医学检验所实验室紧急扩能，核酸检测能力从每天1万管迅速增至6万管。
4月16日，上海出台工业企业复工复产疫情防控指引，并建立了重点企业“白名单”制度。作为其中唯一的工程机械重点企业，连日来，三一重机上海临港产业园在严格落实防疫措施基础上，逐步有序复工。上海三一重机行政总监鲁云帅说，公司采购储备了能满足一个月的生活物资，2100多名员工从3月27日开始食宿在园区，“目前国际订单正在按时出口交付；国内订单生产量恢复到了平时的30%左右，预计本周内可以恢复到正常生产水平。”
此轮疫情发生以来，宝钢股份按照“产能满负荷运行”的计划开展生产组织，4月上半月圆满完成铁钢生产计划，宝山基地重要作业线有效运行率达94.69%；三号高炉历经98天的修整，于3月底重新燃起熊熊炉火。宝钢战略产品无取向硅钢销量同比翻番，厚板产品4月份轧制量完成预定目标的106.73%，无缝钢管热处理线创下9年来的月产最高纪录。
为了有效保证抗疫稳产两不误，宝钢股份按照“划小单元、减少交叉”的原则，对关键岗位进行梳理，将各区域划成最小单元，建立保产专班，实施两班两运转24小时值守生产模式，实施网格化封闭生产管理。同时，借助数字化智慧手段，充分运用网格化人员管理大数据程序、工业机器人、远程操控等技术，让新技术应用转化为抗疫稳产的新动能。
封控20余天，生产稳运行、项目不停步……上海石化实施厂区封控管理，坚持疫情防控和生产经营两手抓。一大批党员干部、生产骨干主动请缨，驻厂员工超3500人，其中党员1000多名，迅速凝聚起稳定生产运行的中坚力量。公司一方面完成汽油、航煤、柴油、民用液化气等保供民生任务，一方面生产乙烯、丙烯、合成树脂等工业原料，满足下游市场用户需求。
在各建设单位抢建方舱医院和集中隔离收治点的同时，国网上海市电力公司跟时间赛跑，日夜紧急施工，为85个防疫重点项目实施快速接电。由于一些企业停工停产，电网负荷有所降低，上海电网173名调度员在各级调控中心24小时驻守调度，确保了上海主电网运行平稳。同时，电力职工还完成封闭居民小区故障抢修2100多起，有力保障了城市安全可靠供电。

集中力量做好自己的事情，把稳定宏观经济、支持实体经济的责任扛在肩上、落到实处，不断巩固壮大实体经济根基
近日发布的2022年一季度国民经济运行情况显示，全国农业（种植业）增加值同比增长4.8%，规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，高技术制造业、装备制造业增加值分别增长14.2%、8.1%。农业生产形势稳定，工业生产较快增长，中高端制造业发展较好，为一季度国民经济开局总体平稳奠定坚实基础，进一步凸显稳定实体经济对稳定宏观经济大盘的重要意义。
实体经济是经济社会发展的基石，也是保障人民群众生活的物质基础。近年来，从坚持金融为实体经济服务到推动数字经济和实体经济融合发展，再到推进产业基础高级化、产业链现代化，一系列政策举措增强了我国实体经济的创新活力和发展后劲。当前，在百年变局和世纪疫情交织的复杂形势下，我国经济发展面临需求收缩、供给冲击、预期转弱三重压力。在此背景下，各方面政策适时靠前发力，更加有效支持实体经济发展，稳定实体经济预期和信心，有助于畅通经济大循环，显著增强我国经济的内生动力和质量优势。
今年以来，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，各地区各部门统筹做好疫情防控和经济社会发展，积极出台有利于经济稳定的政策措施，国民经济延续恢复发展态势。我国经济总体运行在合理区间、拥有很强韧性，重要民生商品保供稳价基础坚实，国内粮食生产、能源供应总体稳定，我们完全有理由坚定发展信心。当前，疫情防控正处于关键紧要时期，实践证明，我们完全有基础、有条件、有能力实现“动态清零”。随着政策效果逐步显现，受抑制的生产和需求必将加速恢复，助力市场逐步回暖，促进经济平稳运行。
对于实体经济运行中的波动，我们既要坚定信心，也要正视困难，加大宏观政策实施力度，积极帮扶市场主体，保障粮食和能源安全，维护产业链供应链稳定。由于疫情影响，一些企业的生产经营活动受阻。当务之急是全力以赴保供稳链，同时，要加大稳健的货币政策实施力度，切实推动金融机构增强信贷投放能力，向实体经济合理让利。特别是加大对小微企业、科技创新、绿色发展的支持，降低企业综合融资成本。积极的财政政策也要提升实施效能，一方面做好退税减税降费政策精准“滴灌”，让留抵退税、出口退税直接助力实体企业轻装前行、恢复发展，另一方面发挥重大项目的牵引撬动作用，统筹把握国债、地方债发行，加快项目开工和建设，尽快形成实物工作量。
今年的《政府工作报告》提出，要统筹稳增长、调结构、推改革。提高宏观调控支持实体经济的效果，离不开将改革同步向纵深推进，更多运用改革的举措、创新的办法促进消费升级、增加有效投资、稳定市场预期。比如，“放管服”改革要同稳住更多消费服务企业、破除消费的障碍相结合，为新消费潜力释放提供坚实支撑。再如，支持企业稳岗保就业应有长远眼光，更多支持企业家专注创业创新、安心经营发展，远近兼顾带动实业投资增长。时代出题，改革答题。要把市场主体的痛点难点堵点作为改革发力点，通过深化改革办实事、解难题。
艰难方显勇毅，磨砺始得玉成。我国经济长期向好的基本面没有改变，也不会改变。集中力量做好自己的事情，把稳定宏观经济、支持实体经济的责任扛在肩上、落到实处，不断巩固壮大实体经济根基，我们就无惧风险挑战，也必能全面塑造“十四五”时期发展新优势。

争分夺秒推进方舱医院、应急医院等援建项目建设，源源不断向香港供应各类医疗和生活物资，多批医疗专家和医护人员集结香江……香港有求，国家必应，两个多月来，中央援港抗疫以最快速度、最强力度、最大覆盖度展开。一个个感人事迹，一项项抗疫行动，香港各界看在眼里、记在心间。不少市民在接受采访时表示，中央全力支持香港特区政府防疫抗疫，让广大香港同胞感受到祖国大家庭的温暖。
近段时间以来，香港第五波新冠肺炎疫情正在逐步受控，新增确诊案例连续回落。稳控疫情，绝非“自然而然”发生，更不是所谓“与病毒共存”的“躺平”带来的，而是中央政府全力支援、香港特区政府负起主体责任、香港社会各界团结一心，共同打响疫情防控阻击战的结果。香港抗疫现实再次证明，只有始终坚持“人民至上、生命至上”理念，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针，才能尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延势头，最大限度保护人民生命安全和身体健康。
香港疫情防控态势向好，但来不得半点大意。坚持“动态清零”，是当前抗击疫情最为科学、有效、经济，最为符合香港实际的策略选择。香港紫荆研究院此前电话随机访问了1063名香港市民，结果显示，67.9%的受访市民认为坚持“动态清零”更符合香港社会整体利益，忧虑香港一旦错误选择“与病毒共存”，疫情必然全面失控，700多万香港市民的生命安全将面临严重威胁。疫情防控成果来之不易，时至今日，更要巩固好、维护好，坚定“动态清零”的决心和信心，谨防反弹、绝不松懈。
对于香港来说，坚持“动态清零”是其和内地通关的必要条件。香港的疫情防控工作，也是全国疫情防控大局的组成部分。这就决定了，香港抗疫不是一城一地之事。当前，疫情仍处于全球大流行期，病毒正在不断变异，奥密克戎毒株传播速度快、受感染人群多。当此形势，香港特区政府要切实履行好主体责任，确保物资发放到位、设施利用到位、防疫措施执行到位，以投身抗疫的实际行动和成效，不辜负中央援港抗疫的深切关怀，不辜负全体香港市民的殷切期盼。
在香港亚博馆新冠治疗中心入口处，摆满了香港市民送来的感谢内地援港医疗队的鲜花和卡片。在这里，内地和香港医护团队默契合作。香港医生除了感激也受到感召，表示如果有一天内地有需要，自己同样有责任，也愿意奉献一份心力。内地医生则说，在疾病面前，内地和香港的医护人员都是一个战壕的战友，共同的心愿是把疫情控制好。两番话语，一颗真心，同样真挚，同样动人。防控成果凝结着医护团队的辛勤付出，将心比心、心同此理，自当倍加珍惜，落实抓细、继续巩固。
中央援港抗疫，充分体现内地与香港的骨肉亲情，充分体现了中央的关怀，充分彰显出“一国两制”的制度优势。无论遇到什么困难，有中央的关心，有内地的支持，有全体港人的共同努力，定能渡过难关。风雨过后见彩虹，期待香港早日迎来云开疫散！

国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长吴良有介绍，3月1日至4月18日，31个省份和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告本土感染者497214例，波及除西藏自治区以外的所有省份。近段时间，全国疫情形势呈现逐渐企稳态势，但地区之间交叉输入影响明显，各地动态清零的任务十分艰巨。河北、江苏、浙江、安徽、广东、福建、辽宁等省疫情总体趋于平稳。吉林省吉林市疫情持续好转，处于下降趋势，长春市疫情呈现下降态势，近日新增感染者均为集中隔离发现，但由于感染基数大，社区风险未完全排除，需持续强化疫情防控措施，巩固防控成果。上海市近日疫情仍处于高位，社区传播风险仍然较高，防控形势依然严峻，防控任务仍十分艰巨紧迫。
农业农村部合作经济司副司长、一级巡视员毛德智介绍，全国“菜篮子”产品的生产总量有保障，目前在田蔬菜面积7384万亩，4月上旬产量达到了1930万吨，相当于可提供每人每天2.7斤菜。一季度肉蛋奶产量同比分别增长8.8%，2.5%和8.3%，水产品供应平稳，目前主要问题是部分地区物流配送不畅。下一步，将会同有关部门全力打通堵点卡点。督促各地把粮油、蔬菜、水果、肉蛋奶、水产品等农产品纳入常态化疫情防控重点保障物资范围，对重点物资运输车辆优先发放全国统一的通行证。加强重点地区“菜篮子”产品保供，推动全域封闭地区尽快设立“菜篮子”产品中转调运站、接驳区或分拨场，采取“换人不换车”等方式，解决跨区运输问题。
交通运输部公路局局长吴春耕表示，要增强物流保通保畅工作的责任心和紧迫感，千方百计、优先保障居民生活必需品的供应，把畅通物资配送“最后一公里”作为重中之重来抓好落实。严格实施货车司机“即采即走即追”“人员闭环管理”的举措。加快推广使用全国统一互认的通行证，确保统一格式，办理方便，足量发放，全国互认，通行顺畅。加快筹备设置和用好物流中转场地，确保货物接驳运输，人员闭环管理，互不接触。
建立重点物资车辆的通行证制度，是应急状态下努力保障重点物资跨区域、跨省份运输的重要举措之一。吴春耕说，交通运输部对规范通行证的制度发放、使用管理等工作作出了部署安排。截至4月17日，23个省份已按要求建立通行证制度，10个省份31个应急物资中转站陆续启用，上海港集卡通行证稳步实施，重点物资运输保障明显改善。
国家邮政局市场监管司副司长边作栋表示，针对部分地区“最后一公里”和“最后一百米”的配送问题，根据地方政府实际需求，配合做好应急物资和生活必需品的运输和配送。截至4月18日，上海市邮政快递企业日均参与保供的车辆已有1200余辆，参与人员3000余人，累计运送的生活物资6000多吨。在吉林省，省邮政管理局统筹全省10家邮政快递企业的运力资源，累计投入车辆近万辆，运输疫情防控和生产生活物资。
“目前还没有发现新冠病毒变异在传染性、致病性等方面有明显的规律，既有可能向传染性增强、致病性减弱方向发展，也有可能向传染性和致病性都增强的方向发展。”中国疾控中心流行病学首席专家吴尊友表示，在未来的疫情防控方面，要从思想上做好长期斗争的准备；提高防控能力，特别是对可能出现的规模化的新冠疫情，要有预判能力、有规避出现规模化疫情的能力；进一步加强疫苗接种工作，特别是对老年人和有基础性疾病的人；要加强人员队伍保障，有能力短、频、快地完成疫情涉及辖区内全员核酸检测；扩建医疗设施，满足接收短期内出现的感染者人数暴增而产生的医疗服务需求；扩建方舱隔离设施，确保无症状感染者和轻症病例能集中隔离观察；做好其他医疗救治资源的储备。
截至4月18日，全国累计报告接种新冠病毒疫苗33亿1746.3万剂次，完成全程接种的人数为12亿4676.9万。60岁以上老年人疫苗接种覆盖人数达到2亿2552.1万，完成全程接种2亿1393.8万，覆盖人数和全程接种人数分别占老年人口的85.41%和81.03%。

《通知》指出，要发挥货币政策总量和结构双重功能，加大对受疫情影响行业、企业、人群等的金融支持。适时增加支农支小再贷款额度，用好普惠小微贷款支持工具，按照地方法人金融机构普惠小微贷款余额增量的1%提供激励资金，将原用于支持普惠小微信用贷款的4000亿元再贷款额度继续滚动使用，促进金融资源向受疫情影响企业、行业、地区倾斜。保障留抵退税资金及时准确直达，促进市场主体尽早享受到政策红利。
据悉，今年以来，人民银行加大流动性投放力度，为支持小微企业留抵退税加速落地，靠前发力加快向中央财政上缴结存利润，截至4月中旬已上缴6000亿元，主要用于留抵退税和向地方政府转移支付，相当于投放基础货币6000亿元，和全面降准0.25个百分点基本相当。4月15日，人民银行宣布全面降准0.25个百分点，将再投放长期资金约5300亿元。从全年看，人民银行将总计上缴超1.1万亿元结存利润，缴款进度靠前发力，视退税需要及时拨付，与其他货币政策操作相互配合，有力保持流动性合理充裕。今年以来人民银行引导市场利率下行0.1—0.15个百分点，带动一季度企业贷款利率同比下降0.21个百分点至4.4%，为有统计以来的记录低点。加大再贷款等结构性货币政策工具的支持力度，用好支农支小再贷款和两项减碳工具，加快1000亿元再贷款投放交通物流领域，创设2000亿元科技创新再贷款和400亿元普惠养老再贷款，预计带动金融机构贷款投放多增1万亿元。

560,驰而不息奋力夺取夏粮丰收,高云才;,5,4/19/22,9,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWNt84xyP1rwe1hcU1CScPtmd8v9NP2Gti5GMgG9fu2BrYXa3_Bzv39qNZ8GToGXQEIIlsli8jbmYIeauNGf7PS24Ll_apQBbFDRyof_uuWsfj2C7_os3_D&uniplatform=NZKPT,"既要打赢疫情防控硬仗，又要打赢稳粮保供硬仗，需要两手抓、两手硬，确保防控不松、农时不误
“悠悠万事，吃饭为大。”这段时间，各地赶早、赶工、赶进度应农时，春管、春播、备耕保粮食，春耕备耕有序展开，春季农业生产扎实推进。从夏粮生产基本面来看，夺取今年夏粮丰收有条件、有基础。目前，冬小麦已大面积拔节孕穗，据农业农村部农情调度，截至4月6日，全国冬小麦一二类苗比例87.9%、比冬前提高17.4个百分点，已与常年基本持平；截至4月16日，全国春播粮食已完成意向面积的19.4%，进度同比快1.2个百分点。
夺取今年夏粮丰收，仍面临诸多挑战。当前，除冬小麦大面积晚播之外，夏粮生产还面临着农资价格持续上扬、国内疫情多点散发、国际农产品供应链风险陡增等因素相互叠加的不利局面。夺取夏粮丰收，需要保持发展定力，稳字当头，稳扎稳打；需要抓住当前春耕生产的突出矛盾，有的放矢，持续发力。
近期，全国本土聚集性疫情呈现点多、面广、频发的特点，防控形势复杂，既要打赢疫情防控硬仗，又要打赢稳粮保供硬仗，需要两手抓、两手硬，确保防控不松、农时不误。抓疫情防控，不能搞“一刀切”，要让农民能下田，农资能下摆，确保春耕生产顺利推进；抓粮食生产，也要做好疫情防控，否则就会危害人民群众身体健康，影响经济社会发展。当务之急是要因地制宜，用好已经证明有效的统筹疫情防控和春耕生产经验，动员有条件的农民抓紧下田，通过动态闭环管理、点对点运输服务等方法确保在外地的农民能够顺利返乡投入生产。
要盯重点、顾全局，持续抓好夏粮田管。夏粮的主体是冬小麦，由于冬麦区去年发生秋汛，导致1.1亿亩冬小麦晚播，尽管苗情现在基本追上来了，但还不能放松，必须不误农时抓好田间管理。当前，要紧盯小麦拔节、抽穗、灌浆等关键生长期，落实好水肥调控、“一喷三防”等稳产增产技术措施，着力增穗数、攻粒数、提粒重，多增一斤是一斤。农业农村部门要继续发挥好下沉一线包省包片工作组和科技小分队作用，加强分类管理、精准指导、精细服务。西北和东北地区要抓住最后窗口期，尽力扩大春小麦播种面积，把意向面积落实到田，能增一亩是一亩。
要抓难点、畅流通，继续多措并举保障农资供应。受外部环境影响，农资价格持续上扬加大了春耕生产成本，成为当前春耕生产的突出矛盾。不能保障农资供应，就难以保证粮食丰收。中央财政在去年秋季一次性补贴粮农200亿元后，今年春季再补贴200亿元，有效地对冲了农资价格上涨压力。同时，国家及早发布了今年粮食收购价格，稳定了粮农种植预期。目前，有关部门要加强农资分品种、分区域价格监测，随时掌握购销储运、下摆入户情况。重点保障化肥农药生产企业原料供应，组织企业有序生产，落实好运输优惠政策，适时投放国储化肥，增加国内市场供应。推动农资到户到田，指导农民科学用肥，继续开展农资打假专项行动，让农民用上放心肥。
夺取夏粮丰收，是实现粮食全年丰收的第一场硬仗，对于开新局、应变局、稳大局有着重要意义。心怀“国之大者”，保持战略定力和耐心，统筹抓好疫情防控和春耕生产，驰而不息奋力夺取夏粮丰收，我们一定能筑牢国家粮食安全防线，把中国人的饭碗牢牢端在自己手中，以实际行动迎接党的二十大胜利召开。

从江南水乡到中原粮仓，农机往来穿梭，田野泛起绿浪。4月18日，一季度经济数据发布。一季度，第一产业增加值同比增长6.0%，春耕春管平稳有序推进，大国粮仓底气足。
宝马集团增资279亿元，将其在华晨宝马的股权占比由50%提升至75%；中国德国商会、中国美国商会的报告显示，71%的德资企业、2/3的美资企业希望增加在华投资……一季度，按美元计算，我国实际使用外资同比增长31.7%，吸收外资“开门稳”。
“华龙一号”示范工程全面建成投产，全球最大纯电动游轮“长江三峡1”号首航……一季度，高技术产业投资以27%的增速领跑，重大工程有力有序推进。
习近平总书记指出，“虽然受到国内外经济环境变化带来的巨大压力，但中国经济韧性强、潜力足、长期向好的基本面没有改变，我们对中国经济发展前途充满信心。”“无论国际风云如何变幻，我们都要坚定不移做好自己的事情，不断做强经济基础，增强科技创新能力，提升综合国力。”
不畏浮云遮望眼，乱云飞渡仍从容。面对国际环境更趋复杂严峻和国内疫情频发带来的多重考验，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，一季度国民经济延续恢复发展态势，经济开局总体平稳。
稳字当头，主要宏观指标保持在合理区间，4.8%的增速来之不易
一季度国内生产总值同比增长4.8%。这样的GDP增速低不低？中国经济运行还稳不稳？
——全面看，这个4.8%，是世界进入新的动荡变革期下实现的增长，中国经济实现稳字当头。
放在全球背景下观察。2022年开年，国际形势继续发生深刻复杂变化，百年变局和世纪疫情相互交织，世界进入新的动荡变革期。国际货币基金组织（IMF）在年初就将今年全球经济增长预期下调了0.5个百分点至4.4%，并于近期表示，俄乌冲突影响将导致143个经济体今年的经济增速预测值再次被下调。
面对如此复杂的外部环境，我们既对“变”保持清醒，更在“稳”中保持定力。“面对外部环境更加复杂严峻，下行压力持续加大，我们把‘稳增长’放在更重要的位置，政策发力适当靠前，增强各种宏观政策有效性，确保了一季度经济平稳运行，用发展化解经济运行中的风险和挑战。这个4.8%的增速，来之不易。”中国宏观经济研究院综合形势研究室主任郭丽岩说。
——动态看，这个4.8%，是最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展影响下实现的增长，中国继续统筹好发展与安全。
近期，我国多省份面临同时段多地发生以奥密克戎变异株为主的疫情防控局面，防控形势严峻复杂。
面对严峻复杂的疫情防控形势，我们完善各种应急预案，严格落实常态化防控措施，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响。一季度国内生产总值同比增长4.8%，增速高于上年四季度0.8个百分点，环比增长1.3%，经济保持扩张态势。
——辩证看，这个4.8%，是就业稳、物价稳、国际收支稳之下的增长，中国经济主要宏观指标保持在合理区间。
看就业，总体稳定格局不变。尽管受疫情冲击影响，3月份全国城镇调查失业率有所上升，但总的看，一季度，全国城镇新增就业285万人，全国城镇调查失业率平均为5.5%，与上年同期基本持平。
“就业优先政策持续发力，助企纾困的力度也在加大，就业形势总体保持基本稳定。”国家统计局新闻发言人付凌晖在国务院新闻办举行的新闻发布会上说，一季度，25—59岁的就业主体人群失业率为4.9%，与上年同期持平。
看物价，居民消费价格温和上涨。一季度，在全球通胀水平显著上升的情况下，我国市场供给总体充足，CPI同比上涨1.1%，比1—2月份涨幅略有扩大，总体温和。
“尽管存在国际输入性因素以及部分鲜活食品短期供给压力，但总的看，CPI保持温和上涨的有利条件比较多。”付凌晖说。
看国际收支，外汇储备保持稳定。一季度，我国货物贸易进出口总值同比增长10.7%，外汇储备稳定在3.2万亿美元左右。
“我国经济韧性强，为外贸增长提供坚实的支撑。”海关总署新闻发言人李魁文介绍，一季度，我国对“一带一路”沿线国家进出口额同比增长16.7%。“助企纾困政策持续发力，特别是跨周期调节稳外贸政策措施效果持续显现，进一步激发了外贸市场主体的活力。”
稳中有进，经济结构调整优化，民生改善继续加强
判断中国经济运行趋势，不仅要看速度，更要看质量和效益。今年一季度，中国经济稳中有进，韧性增强。
——创新发展态势持续，产业升级带动作用明显。
140.8%、24.3%、10.2%，这是一季度，新能源汽车、太阳能电池、工业机器人的产量增幅。随着我国发展阶段变化，市场对中高端产品需求增加，加之创新驱动战略有效实施，产业升级步伐加快。
“装备制造业发展较好，高技术制造业增长较快，对工业支撑的作用比较明显。”付凌晖分析，一季度，装备制造业增加值同比增长8.1%，高技术制造业增加值同比增长14.2%，均明显快于全国规模以上工业增加值增速。
——经济结构调整优化，消费恢复态势不会改变。
大年初一，舞蹈诗剧《只此青绿》杭州站演出开票，仅7分钟售罄；3月，全国巡演海口站演出场次一加再加。“好看，愿意一刷再刷，看不厌。”观众张先生坦言，为了多看几次演出，自己从北京天桥剧场一直追到海南。
一季度，最终消费支出增长对经济增长贡献率为69.4%，比上年同期提高18.7个百分点，高于资本形成总额贡献率，消费主导作用明显。
“一季度，最终消费支出对经济增长贡献仍然是三大需求中贡献最大的。尽管受近期疫情影响，消费增长受到了一定抑制，但是消费恢复态势不会改变，消费‘压舱石’作用仍会显现。”付凌晖说。
——绿色转型稳步推进，单位能耗持续下降。
“张北的风点亮北京的灯”，张北柔性直流电网试验示范工程助力北京冬奥场馆实现100%清洁能源供电；新疆首个集“风能、光伏、火电、储能”于一身的清洁能源基地——中国华电乌鲁木齐100万千瓦风光电基地项目正式开工建设；我国海拔最高的百万千瓦级水电站——雅砻江两河口水电站全部机组投产发电……
一季度，清洁能源消费占比继续提升，天然气、水核风光电等清洁能源消费所占比重比上年同期提高0.8个百分点。单位GDP能耗继续下降。一季度，万元国内生产总值能耗同比下降2.3%。
——民生改善继续加强，居民收入持续增长。
2月9日8时07分，福建、甘肃两省定制的首趟“点对点”返闽务工高铁专列开行。为满足中小企业用工需求，仅福州就在定西发布了3.5万个用工岗位信息。“专列返岗很方便，路上防疫措施也很到位，心里踏实。”定西市陇西县务工人员张世武说。
一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入同比实际增长5.1%，其中，农村居民人均可支配收入实际增长6.3%，城镇居民人均可支配收入实际增长4.2%，农村居民收入增长继续快于城镇居民。
我国经济长期向好基本面没有改变，完全有能力、有条件战胜困难挑战
3月份以来，世界局势复杂演变，国内疫情影响持续，有些突发因素超出预期。中国经济发展趋势如何？
“3月，部分主要指标增速放缓，经济下行压力有所加大。但我国经济长期向好基本面没有改变，经济持续恢复态势没有改变，发展潜力大、韧性足、空间广的特点也没有改变，完全有能力、有条件战胜困难挑战，实现经济持续健康发展。”付凌晖说。
——科学防疫有条件，推动经济恢复基础实。
疫情发生以来，我国科学防控、精准防控，形成了一套有效的、符合实际的防控措施，维护了经济社会大局的稳定。“今年以来，新冠疫情传播特点发生新的变化，但只要坚持科学防疫，我们就能够逐步阻断疫情传播，降低对经济社会发展的不利影响。”付凌晖表示，我国产业体系齐全，基础设施不断改善，超大规模市场优势明显，创新驱动发展成效不断显现，推动经济持续健康发展具有较好的基础。
——经济发展有韧性，支撑经济增长潜力大。
消费恢复态势有望持续。随着疫情影响逐步得到控制，就业优先政策持续发力，将促进居民消费能力和消费意愿提升。发展消费新业态新模式，加快农村消费市场提质扩容，也有利于消费持续增长。
投资拉动作用有望提升。今年以来，各地积极推进重大项目开工建设，带动投资较快增长。随着我国支持实体经济发展力度不断加大，传统产业改造升级、新兴行业创新发展势头增强，将有利于带动产业投资增长。
“从发展趋势看，目前新开工项目与去年同期相比有较大幅度增加，将对投资稳定增长形成有力支撑。”国家发展和改革委投资司司长欧鸿分析。
对外开放红利继续显现。付凌晖分析，总的看，世界经济仍在复苏，对我国出口产品需求仍会增加。同时稳外贸政策持续发力，共建“一带一路”成效不断显现，外贸新业态快速发展，都有利于进出口增长。
——政策支持有力度，促进平稳运行信心足。
“刚享受了税款缓缴，又送来了退税‘红包’，有这一连串‘真金白银’的优惠政策，我们做大企业的信心更坚定了。”河北廊坊大厂回族自治县良盛达花丝镶嵌特艺有限公司负责人马福良说，税务部门提供“一对一”“网上办”等专项服务措施，企业退税手续更简便，“为退税效率点赞!”
减负前行的何止是马福良所在的这一家企业。预计全年退税减税约2.5万亿元；下调金融机构存款准备金率0.25个百分点；通过2000亿元科技创新再贷款和用于交通物流领域的1000亿元再贷款撬动1万亿元资金，建立汽车、集成电路、装备制造等重点产业和外贸企业白名单……今年以来，面对复杂局面，各地区各部门积极出台有利于经济稳定的政策，靠前安排，加快节奏，加大对实体经济支持，体现了稳增长、稳预期的决心。
“改革开放以来，我们已经积累了几十年的宏观调控经验，具备驾驭风险挑战的能力。无论怎样的艰难险阻，坚定信心，稳中求进，就能够一往无前，取得我们的胜利。”国务院参事室特约研究员姚景源说。
风物长宜放眼量。坚定历史自信，保持战略定力，按照党中央、国务院决策部署，不畏艰难，攻坚克难，继续统筹好疫情防控和经济社会发展，中国经济巨轮必将劈波斩浪、行稳致远。

常态化疫情防控以来，中国坚持人民至上、生命至上理念，坚持“动态清零”总方针不动摇，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康，经济发展和疫情防控保持全球领先地位。接受本报记者采访的国际人士认为，中国始终将人民生命安全和身体健康放在第一位，快速和精准的“动态清零”体现尊重科学、尊重规律，使疫情防控以最小成本取得最大成效，有力保障中国经济社会持续健康稳定发展，也为世界经济复苏和稳定增长注入强劲动力。
“真正体现了护佑生命、以人为本”
“人民至上、生命至上”是中国疫情防控的根本出发点和落脚点。中国的抗疫实践表明，坚持“动态清零”，是坚持人民至上、生命至上理念的必然选择，也是对这一理念最好的践行。
“评价防疫政策的最重要标准就是挽救生命的成效。‘动态清零’是保障民众生命健康安全的行之有效的科学经验。”韩国世宗研究所研究委员郑载兴表示，作为14亿多人口的大国，中国常态化疫情防控有力有序，不仅保护更多民众免受新冠病毒危害，也为全球抗疫不断作出积极贡献。
“面对疫情起伏反复、病毒频繁变异的挑战，中国抗疫斗争始终坚持以人为本。”日本“继承和发展村山谈话会”理事长藤田高景表示，中国疫情防控关系到亿万民众的生命健康安全。中国坚持“动态清零”不动摇，果断遏制疫情扩散势头，有助于维护和巩固前期取得的防控成果，充分体现对每一个生命的尊重和保护，彰显以人民为中心的责任担当。
世界卫生组织卫生紧急项目负责人迈克尔·瑞安表示，中国采取强有力措施遏制疫情，新冠肺炎感染率、死亡率都非常低。疫情防控期间，中国的经济和社会继续保持良好运转。相信中国的抗疫举措将不断取得成功，让民众得到最大程度的保护。
“保护人的生命和健康应当是制定抗疫政策的首要考量。‘动态清零’真正体现了护佑生命、以人为本。”泰国中华总商会副主席奔勇表示，中国全面有序开展防控工作，迅速有效应对疫情反复冲击，“中国疫情防控所取得的显著成果，充分展现对人民生命健康的高度负责。”
“科学必要、有效可行的最佳选择”
中国的抗疫实践充分证明，“动态清零”符合中国国情、符合科学、有效可行。力争在短时间内做到“动态清零”，依然是最经济、最有效的疫情防控策略。
“‘动态清零’符合传染病防控规律，具有科学理论依据。”巴西阿雷格里港联邦卫生科学大学传染病学教授露西娅·佩兰达认为，从全球范围看，奥密克戎疫情来势汹汹，对一个国家总体造成的危害并未减轻。考虑到中国人口的庞大基数，只有坚持“动态清零”，才能有效遏制疫情，最大限度保障民众生命健康，保证生产生活正常秩序。
比利时知名病毒学家马克·范·兰斯特认为，“动态清零”是中国在尊重科学和广泛实践基础上探索出的宝贵经验。从成功遏制德尔塔变异株引发的疫情，到严密防控奥密克戎疫情，中国不断提升科学精准防控水平，及时遏制疫情蔓延势头。在应对这场全球公共卫生危机的过程中，中国的防疫政策经受住了考验。基于中国当前疫情形势，“‘动态清零’是科学必要、有效可行的最佳选择”。
世界卫生组织东地中海区域办事处负责人艾哈迈德·曼达里认为，疫情防控始终是一个科学问题。中国现行的抗疫举措，是通过反复研究论证、研判疫情形势、总结抗疫经验作出的科学决策。积极开展监测、快速追踪并隔离密切接触者、分区分级防控等，中国的有效举措为其他国家更好应对疫情提供了有益借鉴。
萨摩亚首席疫情防控专家汉塞尔表示，“动态清零”是基于科学研究和实践检验的有效抗疫策略。萨摩亚参照实施中国“早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗”等防疫措施后，疫情防控能力和有效性显著提升，为维护本国民众生命健康安全构筑起牢固屏障。
“确保了经济社会发展的良好态势”
中国坚持“动态清零”，尽一切可能有效精准平衡疫情防控和正常生产生活及经济社会发展。只有坚持“动态清零”，才能快速控制局部聚集性疫情，用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果。
“当下，疫情是阻碍全球经济发展的重要原因。”南非约翰内斯堡大学非洲—中国研究中心主任戴维·蒙亚埃认为，中国坚持“动态清零”的正确防疫政策，为促进经济平稳健康发展创造了良好条件。“去年，中国货物贸易进出口规模再创历史新高，不仅保障全球产业链供应链基本稳定，有效弥补全球供需缺口，也有力提振世界经济复苏的信心。”
吉尔吉斯斯坦科学院院长穆拉特·朱马塔耶夫认为，得益于坚持“动态清零”，中国最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响，去年经济增速在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。这充分表明，有效的疫情防控是经济发展的有力保障，稳固的防疫成果可以为经济增长营造稳定安全的发展环境。
藤田高景表示，经济社会正常的动态循环以疫情得到切实防控为前提，疫情越早得到遏制，经济发展所受影响就越小。中国坚持“动态清零”，把疫情造成的影响和损失降到最低。疫情防控取得的突出成果，“确保了经济社会发展的良好态势，中国推动实现高质量发展不断取得新成效”。
“在全球疫情反复不定、世界经济复苏充满不确定性的背景下，‘动态清零’确保了中国疫情防控形势和经济发展持续向好。”奔勇表示，去年，中国吸收外资规模再创新高，充分说明各国企业对中国经济稳健发展充满信心，体现了中国疫情防控措施的科学性、准确性。

563,以快制快，坚决打赢疫情防控攻坚战,仲音;,4,4/19/22,78,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruUtEBTNJkkOksJJgIltNsmYpILQcyTdIObmYwudQIiGSS7I3UE2Szz93EctwX72Gq1Ty9VHRNzDdwOSIy8T_0Ll5Xn35zIPS3HZ1joTKDiAqJ2rL0eZ5_y6&uniplatform=NZKPT,"加快核酸筛查和风险人员排查管控，加快方舱医院建设，加快床位周转速度……上海本轮疫情发生以来，上海各区、各部门以刻不容缓的紧迫感，以决战冲锋的执行力，着力抢时间、提效率、补短板、强弱项，推动各项疫情防控措施发挥作用。当前上海疫情防控正处于关键阶段，只有坚定不移贯彻“动态清零”总方针，采取坚决有力的措施，才能推动疫情传播尽快出现拐点，让社会面疫情尽快实现清零。
与病毒赛跑，就是与时间竞速，跑得越快，就越能掌握战“疫”主动权。上海本轮疫情流行的毒株主要是奥密克戎BA.2，传播速度非常快。研究显示，相比德尔塔毒株，奥密克戎毒株BA.1的传播速度要快77%，而BA.2毒株，传播速度又比BA.1快66%。如果没有任何干预措施，一个奥密克戎感染者会传染9.5个人。再加上，奥密克戎变异株隐匿性特别强，无症状感染者和轻症病例占比非常高，而无症状感染者和轻症患者同样有传染性。从科学的角度而言，给奥密克戎变异株留下一点可乘之机，就会迅速感染一大片。只有快字当头、以快制快，强化风险管控，通过筛查找出传染源，及时转运隔离，才能避免造成大范围的传播。
人民至上、生命至上，尽快遏制疫情才是真正敬佑每一个生命。从公共卫生的角度看，全人群都是奥密克戎变异株的易感人群。同时，从致病性角度看，奥密克戎变异株绝不是“大号流感”，其危害性决不能低估。那些“躺平”的国家和地区，老年人和其他脆弱人群的病死率都比预想的要高很多。如过敏性哮喘的新生儿，或者有基础病的老年人，一旦叠加病毒感染就有导致重症的危险。根据上海市卫健委的通报，截至4月17日24时，在定点医疗机构接受治疗的重型患者有16例；4月17日，新增死亡病例3例，均为高龄，同时合并严重基础疾病，均未接种新冠疫苗。这也充分说明，奥密克戎毒株流行的危害依然严重。及早发现疫情、快速处置疫情、严格落实防控举措，才能控制传染源、切断传播途径、保护易感人群。
以快制快，既考验执行效率，也考验协同效率。比如，在感染者收治上，阳性感染者和密接者转运不及时，疫情就会持续在社区传播，防控局面就会始终被动，必须坚决克服拖延思想和畏难情绪，迅速统筹调集资源力量，坚决果断推进“四应四尽”，让感染者得到收治，密接人员隔离到位；在方舱医院收治与管理上，由于上海市新冠病毒感染者数量处于高位，部分感染者无法及时收入定点医院隔离治疗，有必要进一步加快方舱医院建设，加强资源统筹，各区深挖潜力，畅通出院流程，尽早实现出院人数大于入院人数的正向循环；在民生保障上，疫情防控越是到最吃劲的时候，民生保障就越要细致，必须带着深厚感情安排好群众生活，多关心群众的困难，切实保障好就医用药、食品供应，畅通应急救助电话和就医“绿色通道”，决不能因为疫情防控而顾此失彼。抓细抓实疫情防控各项举措，做到快而有序、高效协同，方能尽快实现社会面清零目标。
快速，是动态清零的精髓之一。发现早、处置快，就能够及时切断疫情传播链条，尽早让社会生产生活回到正轨。山东省3月29日宣布自2月底以来的这波疫情实现社会面动态清零，复工复产进入“快车道”；深圳市从按下“慢行键”，实施科学精准的抗疫策略，到4月8日起有序推进各级各类学校返校复课；吉林省4月14日宣布各市州实现社会面清零，社会生产生活秩序逐步恢复……以快制快，让我们做到了疫情发现一起、扑灭一起。发扬拼搏精神，保持战斗状态，勠力同心、以快制快，就一定能早日战胜疫情，打赢这场疫情防控攻坚战。

眼下，中原大地小麦渐次孕穗、抽穗。河南省坚持扛稳粮食安全重大政治责任，在抓细抓实各项防疫举措的基础上，实施“全力以赴保夏粮丰收”行动。河南省农业农村厅组织18个省级小麦专家指导组，分区分类精准指导。
“服务到地头，政策落地快，咱农民咋不乐呵哩？”宪录村种粮大户张春河说，技术有指导，防疫有服务，一个电话化肥农药就送上门，下地干活回到家有专人来做防疫。“政府今年还推广小麦、玉米等农作物保险，让我们能够安心种粮食，收入有保障。”
防疫春耕两手抓，不误农时不负春。地处豫东平原的周口市项城市，小麦长势喜人。三店镇组织专家“云端”答疑，引导农民错峰下地，发放防疫、农药等物资，帮助在外务工农户浇地、施肥、喷药，努力确保夏粮实现单产、总产“双增”。
“我们按照疫情防控要求，人员分散下田、错时劳作。有啥不懂的地方，县里帮我们联系农技专家指导解决。”在扶沟县永珍家庭农场，农场主穆永珍正操作无人机为500亩小麦进行农药喷洒作业。为了抢抓农时，保春耕春管，扶沟县农业部门组织80余名农技人员走访专业合作社、家庭农场、种植大户，指导农民科学做好肥水调控、病虫害防治、绿色防控等田间管理。
“入春以来，我通过电话预约、网上订购等方式，收到了配送到家的化肥、种子，真是越来越方便了。”穆永珍说。为克服疫情影响，扶沟县加强对化肥、柴油、农膜、种子等农资商品的调运储备，通过各种方式，把适合农户使用的农资商品配送进村入户。
为保障农资供应，河南省已累计发放应急物资运输通行证1.8万张，直达各县（市、区），确保农药、种子、肥料等物资运输通畅有序。“我们拿到了329张通行证，每天约1.1万吨尿素、复合肥都能及时运走。”河南心连心化工集团有关负责人说。
“疫情防控、春耕春管、灾后重建，哪一项都不能耽误。”辉县市委书记刘军伟说，去年河南遭遇特大暴雨灾害，市里投资4.4亿元，加快灾损农田修复重建，有力提升农业防灾减灾能力。
截至目前，河南全省高标准农田累计建成7580万亩，小麦一、二类苗占比达到93.5%，与去年持平，苗情好于预期。作为全国粮食生产大省，河南今年的粮食产量目标是稳定在1300亿斤以上。

565,中国经济面面观,安蓓;姜琳;张辛欣;申铖;吴雨;王雨萧;姚均芳;,1,4/18/22,88,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruXxYU7GZUdhm7HuumE9rkE2UyKgHEgNXB8BFZwG1wZ1TSCrBHRr3A3m56knpObjSDIq62SyRe89gYANg4Gwjg4Y5FIyk9MSfSsDNhg3btmCJQ==&uniplatform=NZKPT,"18日，2022年一季度国民经济运行情况即将发布。在近期国内外环境复杂性不确定性加剧、国内疫情多发的背景下，中国经济大势如何，备受关注。
观察大国经济，既要看数据升降之“形”、市场变化之“态”，又要看百姓获得之“实”，更要把握长期发展之“势”。
针对各方关切的热点问题，新华社记者多方调研采访，从“账面”“市面”“人面”“基本面”四个方面，全景式观察中国经济。
看“账面”：下行压力下，经济大局怎么看？
“账面”，即事关经济运行的大数据。观察经济运行状况，既要看国家宏观“账面”，也要盘点行业“账面”和企业“账面”。
从经济增长态势、国际收支和财政收支看国家家底大“账”，当前经济运行存在较大下行压力，但稳的底盘依然坚实。
权威部门分析认为，中国经济总体运行在合理区间，首季有望实现“开门稳”，经济增速预测值高于去年第四季度。
今年前两个月，在一系列稳增长政策推动下，中国经济的供给面和需求面从压力中转暖：全国固定资产投资同比增长12.2%，社会消费品零售总额同比增长6.7%，规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.5%，货物进出口总额同比增长13.3%……支撑经济增长的主要因素均出现好于预期的恢复。
3月以来，超出预期的疫情“倒春寒”和乌克兰局势复杂演变，对中国经济稳定恢复形成冲击，市场预期出现较大波动，消费、就业、投资、工业增加值等一些主要经济运行指标增长态势受阻，显示经济承压上升。
已披露的数据显示，3月中国制造业采购经理指数（PMI）为49.5%，比上月下降0.7个百分点，低于临界点，制造业总体景气水平有所回落；3月出口增速出现下滑，进口增速较前两个月下降15.6个百分点，出现2020年9月以来首次同比负增长。
“前两个月数据支撑下，一季度中国经济总体保持在合理区间。3月份以来不确定性因素增多，经济爬坡过坎的难度在加大。一季度总的数据看平稳开局。”中国社会科学院财经战略研究院副院长杨志勇说。
当前，中国经济发展面临的需求收缩、供给冲击、预期转弱三重压力没有改变，一些不利因素还在复杂演变，新的下行压力进一步加大，对挑战考验要有充分的认识。
今年中国确定了5.5%左右的经济增长目标。对于一个总量达114万亿元的经济体来说，5.5%的经济增量，相当于5年前增长7.4%、10年前增长10.5%，相当于一年增长一个中等经济体。在内外形势发生新变化的当下，完成这个目标，有希望有潜力，但需要付出更大更艰苦的努力。
国际收支，折射一个国家对世界经济的影响力。其中，外汇储备事关国际支付能力是否充裕，贸易量则是对外经贸往来的重要指标。
截至2022年3月末，中国外汇储备规模为31880亿美元，总体保持稳定。今年一季度，我国进出口同比增长10.7%，实现高基数上稳开局，为实现全年目标打下较好基础。作为全球第一贸易大国，2021年中国39万亿元的对外贸易总额约占全球1/5。
财政是国家的“钱袋子”。今年前2个月，全国一般公共预算收入同比增长10.5%，反映经济持续复苏；一般公共预算支出同比增长7%，民生和重点领域支出得到有力保障。
今年预算安排的支出规模超过26万亿元。有关部门分析认为，一季度财政收入将保持平稳增长势头，将进一步加大支出力度，为稳定经济大盘提供关键支撑。
世界第二大经济体、第一大工业国、第一大外汇储备国……今天的中国经济，时刻牵动世界目光。
“我国发展韧性强、潜力大、后劲足，国民经济运行整体效能明显提升，内需完整性与外需支撑力增强，有能力有条件顶住下行压力和风险，有底气有信心稳定宏观经济大盘。”中国宏观经济研究院综合形势研究室主任郭丽岩说。
国家大“账”背后，是行业领域、工厂车间，更有市场商户、万家灯火。
千行万业汇流成中国经济大海。从行业领域“账面”看，不同行业表现“冷热不均”，整体稳定的态势并未改变。
从构成我国工业的41个大类看，根据国家统计局数据，今年1至2月，有22个行业实现利润同比增长或减亏，其中有15个行业利润增速超过10%，中国经济依然强韧。
受益于国际大宗商品价格高涨，能源原材料等上游行业利润大幅上升。经过一轮市场出清，船舶制造行业迎来扩张周期。1至2月，75家重点监测船舶企业主营业务收入同比增长13.9%。
经济加快转型，高技术产业和新兴产业迎来发展的春天。今年前两个月，软件业务、信息技术服务收入同比分别增长11.6%和13.1%。新能源汽车、集成电路、医疗健康等站上风口。一季度新能源汽车产销同比均增长1.4倍。
3月份以来，具有强传染性的奥密克戎变异株迅速蔓延至我国30个省份，累计报告本土感染者超32万例……疫情防控的形势严峻复杂，也给诸多行业带来直接冲击。餐饮业、零售业、旅游业、公路水路铁路运输业、民航业等接触式聚集性服务业运营艰难。中国旅游研究院估算，一季度全国国内旅游出游人次和国内旅游收入按可比口径只有2019年同期的80%和47%。
“仅今年3月份，全省餐饮业估算累计损失上百亿元。”江苏省餐饮行业协会会长于学荣说，对417家企业的调研反馈显示，全省星级酒店餐饮营收下降明显，一些小型餐饮企业的营业门店生存困难。
企业稳则经济稳。企业是经济运行的细胞，亿万市场主体构成经济发展的中坚。“稳字当头、稳中求进”的经济工作要求，关键之处就是要看超1.5亿户市场主体能否稳定预期、稳健发展。
从企业“账面”看，大型企业、上游企业和高新技术企业经营效益较好；但为数不少的中小微企业和个体工商户，面临较大困难，不容忽视。
今年1至2月，全国国有及国有控股企业营业总收入同比增长14%，利润总额同比增长16.8%。对经济总量贡献度占六成的4800万家中小微企业继续保持较高活跃度。一季度民营企业进出口同比增长14.1%，拉动外贸增长6.6个百分点。
从A股4700多家上市公司看，截至4月15日，共有1795家上市公司披露2021年年报，近九成公司实现营业收入增长，约七成实现净利润增长；截至4月14日，已发布2022年一季度业绩预告的498家公司中，有387家预计一季度净利润增长，其中190家预计净利润最大增幅超过100%。
值得注意的是，当前中小企业面临的压力在上升，一季度中国中小企业发展指数连续四个季度下降。一些制造业企业原材料成本上升、订单外流、库存压力加大、产业链供应链堵点卡点增多，现金流吃紧。在服务业领域，一些中小微企业或个体工商户，面临消费市场萎缩、经营成本上升、人工租金上涨、防疫开支增加、平台佣金高企，融资难融资贵问题依然突出。
一个个市场主体，连接经济命脉与城乡循环，关系着人们的柴米油盐、三餐四季。在当前超预期冲击下，中国正点燃更多政策“篝火”，温暖市场主体，稳定发展预期。
实施新的组合式税费支持政策，全年为市场主体退税减税约2.5万亿元；金融系统加大力度向经济“输血”，一季度新增人民币贷款同比创新高；今年3.65万亿元新增地方政府专项债中用于项目建设的额度已全部下发，将带动更多社会投资投向基础设施建设，发挥稳经济稳就业关键作用。
新华社多路记者采访了解到，各地多部门正在想方设法研究出台更多有针对性的稳增长政策。专家建议，要确保已出台政策早落地早见效，同时政策工具箱要准备充足，必要时及时出手。
综合观察中国经济“账面”——外贸保持稳定，内需需要提振；高技术产业加速奔跑，接触式服务业遭遇“寒流”；上游产业较热，一些下游产业遇冷；一些大型企业效益较好，不少中小企业压力加大；国家财政整体稳定，一些基层财政压力大；中国经济长期向好的基本面没有改变，但新的挑战和风险不断出现……
这就是今天的中国经济：稳字当头、稳中求进。开局平稳中，有亮点，也有难点；有希望，也有困难。机遇与挑战交织，动力与压力并存。
看“市面”：震荡波动中，活力如何？
“市面”，观察经济活力的窗口。
近期，国内不少城市特别是一线城市旅游业态势寒意逼人，一些景区关闭，跨省团队旅游暂停，部分旅行社经营困难。
足不出户，心更向往。中国旅游研究院一项调查显示，未来3个月内城乡居民出游意愿为86.33%，同比、环比分别上升2.14和1.01个百分点。中国旅游研究院院长戴斌表示，如果疫情得到全面控制，过去两年多积累的出游力可能为国内旅游市场带来一个令人期待的“小阳春”。
当前，为应对疫情冲击，全国一些地方按下“暂停键”，从产业链供应链稳定到物资配送、人员往来，再到市场人气、消费活力，在适应统筹疫情防控与经济社会发展的形势下，出现新变化。
从人流看“市面”，寻找坚韧前行的“暖意”——
3月以来，受国内疫情多发影响，消费恢复势头受阻。大环境遇冷，市场呈现不同的冷暖变化。一些城市线下商贸遇冷或中断，对实体零售、餐饮服务带来冲击。市场预计，3月份国内消费可能会出现较明显收缩。
疫情之下，人流骤减。3月以来，国内民航航班数量大幅减少，甚至不足去年同期的1/5，一些中小型民营航空公司陷入经营危机；全国铁路日均开行旅客列车只有3000列左右，不到正常水平的30%；国内电影票房陷入低谷，多地影城单日售票仅为个位数，不少影院被迫停业；一些个体工商户反映，生意清淡，有的不得不停业，但硬性成本还需要按月支付……
从14部门出台43项政策促进服务业领域困难行业恢复发展，到国务院减轻企业负担部际联席会议进一步明确企业减负重点，再到各个地方版纾困举措，从减税降费、金融支持到房租减免、平台佣金减免、暂时歇业备案……年初以来，纾困政策密集出台。记者了解到，各地各部门正加紧研究更有针对性的配套政策，加快为相关市场主体解“燃眉之急”。
各类市场主体也努力应变，在艰难中努力前行。在武汉户部巷、北京簋街等餐饮街市，一些餐厅堂食人气少了，档口却排起了长队；一些地方网红店转战“线上”、外拓市场；一些航空公司通过狠抓成本压降、科学调整运力努力自救……
传统线下市场骤冷，线上市场、下沉市场和创新型消费等却持续升温。
在义乌国际商贸城，24岁的外贸公司业务员小丁一边拿着自拍杆，一边指着各种挂钟为电话另一头的巴勒斯坦客商询价。受疫情影响，义乌市场“摩肩接踵”的景象不复往日，但“云采购”“线上淘”人气旺盛。今年前两个月，义乌市进出口总值较去年同期增长47.8%。
美团、京东、饿了么等各大平台网购火热，1至2月全国网上零售额近2万亿元，同比增速超过10%；一季度国内新能源汽车销量超百万辆；海南离岛免税购物金额同比增长8.4%；冬奥赛事直播、冰雪消费、在线旅游持续受到热捧，以冰墩墩为代表的冬奥会周边纪念商品网上仍在热销……
从人流看“市面”，疫情防控期间，一些消费被抑制，但消费需求并没有消失。传统消费转型升级、新型消费潜力释放、线上消费强势“补血”……
作为全球第二大消费市场和第一大货物贸易国，中国仍将是世界经济大循环的关键枢纽，庞大的市场中蕴藏着无限机遇。
从物价看“市面”，有压力但走势平稳——
4月15日，汽油柴油零售价格迎来今年首次下调。“七连涨”后，这个消息让不少货运司机稍缓了口气。
物价关系百姓生活，反映消费冷暖。
今年以来，由于国际局势动荡造成大宗商品市场大幅波动，全球多个经济体面临严峻通胀压力。3月份美国CPI同比上涨8.5%，刷新40多年来的新高。
与美国、欧洲不断刷新的价格涨幅相比，3月我国CPI同比上涨1.5%，涨幅比上月提高0.6个百分点；一季度CPI总体上涨1.1%，保持温和上涨态势。
美国彭博社发文评价说，尽管物流遭遇短暂的不畅，但当下中国的食品和能源价格却保持稳定。“中国可以在通胀问题上给西方上一课。”
虽然稳物价基础较好，但输入性通胀的压力在上升，物价态势引人关注。
粮食为物价之基，一头连着农民，一头连着市民。粮食供应，至关重要。中国粮食产量连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上，市场供应充足，但粮食安全不容任何闪失。当前，春管春播正由南向北大面积展开。从中央到地方高度重视，在做好疫情防控的前提下，想方设法确保不误农时抓好春管春耕。
截至4月11日，全国已春播粮食1.41亿亩、完成意向面积的15%，进度同比快0.9个百分点。全国早稻已栽插58.6%，进度同比快5.2个百分点。
能源，事关物价总水平，牵一发动全身。能源保障影响全局。综合来看，一季度煤炭产量持续高位稳定运行，价格稳步回落，全国统调电厂存煤1.5亿吨以上，处于历史同期最高水平；电力供应平稳有序；油气供应有保障，有力支撑工业生产，确保民生需求。
我国粮食库存处于历史高位、蔬菜在田面积增加、肉类价格总体较为稳定……从中央到地方，把守好“米袋子”“菜篮子”、确保能源安全稳定供应当作底线任务，为重要民生商品的保供稳价筑牢基础。
从物流看“市面”，在防与放中努力保畅通——
刚在车里休息了一晚，来自山东的货车司机张晓亮把车开进杭州物流园区，等待装货返程。800多公里、12个多小时的路程，他既熟悉又感到充满未知。“现在跑车不确定性确实很多。”
油价上涨、运费缩减、高速公路上的种种限行……货车司机生存状况及引发供应不畅备受关注。
3月以来，疫情多地散发。部分地区跨区域货物运输不畅，物流效率明显降低。根据中国物流与采购联合会的数据，今年3月份中国物流业景气指数已经处于2020年3月份以来的历史低点。
工业品物流占社会物流总额90%左右，生产供应链全流程的90%以上处于物流环节。
有的汽车厂已宣布因供应链原因整车停产。一些汽车厂负责人表示，由于疫情影响，一些关键零部件供应商采用封闭生产维持运转，但人力短缺和上游原材料供应不畅也使相关工厂只能维持较低产能水平。
航空铁路港口航运的畅通高效，高速公路大货车的自由穿梭、大街小巷配送车的自由流动、最后1公里快速的配送，是中国经济繁荣发展的大动脉，更是民众须臾不可离的“生命线”。
让已出台的政策尽快落地，让供应链断点尽快重新连接，让货车跑起来，保障物流“生命线”，是迫在眉睫的大事。
把握好防与放的辩证法，在做好疫情防控的同时，努力保障物流畅通，在当前尤为关键：公布全国统一式样重点物资运输车辆通行证、切实保障重点物资和邮政快递通行、加强从业人员服务保障、优化防疫通行管控措施……近期，一系列部署密集指向货运物流保通保畅。
形势已有所缓解：长三角铁路为省际运输开辟了保供运输绿色通道，3月30日至4月13日，通过铁路运抵上海的各类保供物资已达1497车、47386吨；相关高速公路上设立便捷通道，保障抗疫重要民生物资和重要生产物资优先通行；全国多地针对性地设置了应急接驳点、卸货区……
安全、高效率的物流体系，庞大的交通物流基础设施，是中国形成全球产业链竞争优势的重要支柱。
在做好防疫工作的前提下，确保中国物流体系运转畅通，对国内和国际供应链产业链意义凸显：一季度，全国港口货物吞吐量、集装箱吞吐量继续保持稳定增长。国家铁路完成货物发送量同比增长2.8%。西部陆海新通道铁海联运班列累计发送17万标箱，同比增长56.5%。
从资金流看“市面”，在震荡波动中守好“稳”的底线——
4月15日，中国人民银行宣布下调金融机构存款准备金率，释放长期资金约5300亿元，将有利于保持流动性合理充裕，增强信贷总量增长的稳定性。
今年一季度新增人民币贷款同比再创新高，但全部产业中长期贷款同比少增4215亿元。这意味着一些企业中长期投资意愿减弱，中长期信贷需求不旺。
激发市场主体需求，政策需靠前发力，货币政策工具箱储备充足，正面激励举措陆续出台：
鼓励拨备水平较高的大型银行有序降低拨备率，创设科技创新和普惠养老两项专项再贷款，增加支农支小再贷款，用好普惠小微贷款支持工具，用政府专项债补充中小银行资本……
“中国大型科技企业盈利前景稳健，企业创新增长的潜力不应被忽视。”英国《金融时报》近日发文称。
当前，境外资金流动备受关注。受俄乌冲突、美联储加息等影响，全球金融市场动荡，中国金融市场也难独善其身。我国债市、股市资金一度出现净流出，投资者担心资金外流或演变为长期趋势。
担忧，反映在市场上：3月份，境外机构投资者减持人民币债券约1100亿元，为近年来最大单月降幅。上证综指、深证成指一季度分别下跌10.65%、18.44%，中概股、港股大幅下挫。
关键时刻，国务院金融稳定发展委员会召开专题会议，直面市场关切；金融管理部门先后发声，推出相关举措，稳定市场信心。
3月跨境资金流入总体回升，外汇市场供求基本平衡。相较欧元、日元等其他非美元货币对美元汇率连创新低，3月末人民币对美元汇率交易价较2021年末升值0.5%。
看“人面”：民生底线能否兜牢？
一组组经济“账面”数据，一幅幅“市面”场景，终究要体现在“人面”上，这就是老百姓获得感多少的真实体现。
就业是最大的民生工程，经济下行压力加大之时，就业形势面临着严峻考验——
经济遭遇挑战，首当其冲影响就业。今年需要就业的城镇新增劳动力约1600万人。其中高校毕业生达1076万人，创历史新高。还有上亿农民工要打工撑起一家生活，许多人需要再就业。形势严峻、就业不易。
记者调研了解到，部分企业用工需求收缩、招工放缓，甚至出现减员裁员。智联招聘、前程无忧、58同城等网络招聘机构均反映，前两个月就业形势平稳，但3月份数据掉头向下，使得一季度整体就业景气度偏弱。旅游、房地产、教育培训、互联网等行业招聘需求明显下滑，高校毕业生等重点群体就业问题突出。
就业连着收入，关系着每个家庭的生活。西安一家大型商场的服装店店员陈女士说，受疫情影响，整个商场不时关闭停业，自己的收入跟随客流量大幅下滑。
稳就业，是经济工作的重中之重。今年，中央财政就业补助资金安排617.58亿元，比去年增加51.68亿元，在稳大盘中努力托住全年1100万人以上的城镇新增就业目标。
抓关键。对餐饮、零售、旅游、民航、公路水路铁路运输等特困行业实施缓缴社保政策；显著提高中小微企业失业保险稳岗返还比例，最高可至90%；允许再拿4%的失业保险基金结余用于技能培训，向困难中小微企业发放留工培训补助……“真金白银”惠企业、稳用工。
稳重点。发布促进高校毕业生创业就业的政策举措，部署为高校毕业生提供200万个高质量就业机会；组织“春风行动”为务工人员、脱贫人口等提供就业服务……保障好高校毕业生、农民工、退役军人等重点群体就业，全力稳住就业大盘。
扩空间。完善灵活就业政策，在北京等七省份及出行、外卖等行业的七家互联网头部平台企业开展新就业形态就业人员职业伤害保障试点，让新就业形态解燃眉之急，发挥就业“蓄水池”作用。
越是遇到困难，越要兜牢兜好民生底线，确保百姓有获得感、安全感——
4月1日起，四川、湖南、福建、重庆等多省份提高了最低工资标准。按照这一新政，四川成都一位制造企业的保洁员石女士，每月底薪将上涨320元，加班费也会有所提高，合计每月收入能涨将近500元。
鼓“钱袋子”、护“药罐子”、稳“菜篮子”，对百姓特别是低收入群体意义重大。越是特殊时期，越要切实保障和改善教育、医疗、养老、育儿等民生之需，解决好人民群众普遍关心关注的民生问题。
针对急难愁盼问题，今年居民医保和基本公共卫生服务经费人均财政补助标准分别再提高30元和5元；退休人员基本养老金将迎来“18连涨”；推出3岁以下婴幼儿照护费用可按照每个每月1000元的标准纳入个人所得税专项附加扣除；将群众关注的骨科耗材、种植牙等纳入集中采购，降低群众看病负担……
针对疫情带来的短暂困难，延续执行失业保险保障阶段性扩围政策，向广大失业人员发放失业补助金，向失业农民工发放临时生活补助；针对受疫情影响不能按时还房贷的居民，包括五大行在内的多家银行可提供包括延后还款时间、延长贷款期限、调整账单计划等在内的服务支持……
针对特殊群体和困难群众，今年安排救助补助资金1546.83亿元，较去年增加70.62亿元；加大保供稳价力度，及时做好城乡低保、特困供养、残疾人、困境儿童等救助工作；推动脱贫人口务工规模不低于3000万人，牢牢守住不发生规模性失业返贫的底线……
人心齐、泰山移，越是困难越要坚定信心，用双手创造更美好的明天——
人是生产力中最活跃的因素，是发展的根本力量。前行中尽管有困难、有压力，但依靠团结奋斗，面对广阔的发展前景，有每个人为了自己的小目标不断坚持，日子就更有奔头。
当一些海外媒体渲染中国防疫政策使脱贫人口面临返贫风险时，各个地方的成千上万名基层干部已经忙碌在防止返贫、推进乡村振兴、推动共同富裕第一线。
加强防返贫动态监测帮扶、保持小额信贷政策连续稳定、支持开发公益岗位临时安置……吉林省出台11条政策措施防范化解脱贫人口持续稳定增收面临的风险隐患。随着疫情好转，吉林已有近10万滞留农民返乡备春耕，努力把失去的时间抢回来。
“我们计划到2025年达到1024位量子比特，时间宝贵，每一天都不能浪费。”作为合肥本源量子计算科技有限责任公司轮值董事长，“90后”孔伟成和200多人的团队夜以继日坚守在研发一线。
身处疫情影响最重的娱乐服务业，魅KTV全国200家门店已有140家暂停营业。“短暂的‘倒春寒’终会过去。”创始人吴海说，“现在关键是疫情早日实现动态清零。只要疫情控制住，大概一个月生意就会反弹，也能迅速恢复到正常水平。这也是为什么我们的门店能从两年前的几十家发展到现在的200家。”
此时此刻，在抗疫一线，无数医护人员、社区干部、下沉党员、志愿者、快递小哥日夜奔忙，同坚守的亿万群众一起，筑起中国抗疫的坚固防线。
上海，汇聚近5万名医务工作者和核酸检测的力量，疫情防控攻坚战已取得阶段性成果，此前消息显示，疫情的传播指数由当初的2.27下降到1.23，早日实现社会面清零的目标已越来越近……在疫情防控稳定可控地区，一批重点项目抓紧推进。
看“基本面”：形势复杂多变，长期向好发展趋势会不会改变？
4月14日，沈阳“重启”第二天，华晨宝马就发布重磅消息，大东工厂产品升级项目正式开业。
3月底，宝马集团宣布在中国市场推出全新BMW X5车型。2月，这家跨国公司通过增资279亿元人民币的方式，将其在华晨宝马的股权占比由50%提升至75%，并将与中国合作伙伴的合作期延长至2040年。
看好中国的并不只有宝马。
德国科技公司贺利氏今年正抓紧在中国多地推进总投资约2亿美元的近10个项目。公司大中华区总裁艾周平说，虽然疫情封控管理对企业的短期生产经营活动会有影响，但有信心战胜疫情、持续发展。
投资通常考虑的是中长期因素。无论是持续增资，还是全新布局，外资动向的背后，透露出他们对中国经济长期向好基本面的坚定信心。
在去年吸引外资首破1万亿元人民币基础上，今年一季度，全国实际使用外资3798.7亿元，实现同比25.6%的高增长。同期中国东部、中部、西部地区实际使用外资同比分别增长23.4%、60.7%和21.9%；全国有21个省（区、市）实际使用外资实现两位数以上增长。全面、均衡的良好引资态势，印证全球资本对中国市场的长期看好。
今天的中国，是一个拥有14亿多人口、超4亿中等收入群体、人均GDP超过1万美元的超大规模市场的经济大国——

566,严格落实常态化疫情防控措施,NA;,1,4/18/22,515,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruXxYU7GZUdhm7HuumE9rkE2UyKgHEgNXB8BFZwG1wZ1TSCrBHRr3A3mXNhuDGrQPn6NWXukCnTStCNpbz5KHBVfQAeGvalh7It6KAhKTvxi9Q==&uniplatform=NZKPT,"常态化疫情防控是一项艰巨繁重又需要持久坚持的工作，各地区各部门各方面必须有充分的思想准备和工作准备。近日，习近平总书记在海南考察时强调，要“完善各种应急预案，严格落实常态化防控措施，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响”，这对于我们扎实做好常态化疫情防控工作、更好统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展具有重大指导作用。
当前疫情防控面临复杂性、艰巨性、反复性的严峻形势。从病毒特性来看，奥密克戎变异株具有传播速度快、隐性感染和轻症病例比例高等特点，更容易造成大范围的传播。如不及时从严防控，势必令易感人群感染风险加大，最终将形成规模性反弹。两年多来的实践已经证明，常态化疫情防控总策略、总方针是正确的、有效的。虽然奥密克戎变异株具有极强的传播力，但只要做到早发现、早管控、早治疗，切断传播途径，保护好易感人群，仍然能够及时有效控制疫情。这就要求我们坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针不动摇、不放松，以时不我待的精神抓实抓细常态化疫情防控各项工作，以更早、更快、更严、更实的防控措施阻断疫情传播，有力有效保障人民群众生命健康和经济社会发展。
面对疫情反复冲击，有的人认为奥密克戎变异株症状轻，思想上容易松懈麻痹，对常态化疫情防控和应急处置放松了要求。必须深刻认识到，如果不管“防”，只管“治”，我国医疗体系将面临击穿危险。要坚持常态化精准防控和局部应急处置有机结合，在做好常态化疫情防控工作的同时，对可能出现的局部疫情做好应急准备和有效处置，把困难估计得更多一些，把问题想得更严重一些，宁可备而不用，也绝不打无准备之仗。要严格口岸和边境地区防控，坚持人、物、环境同防，突出人员闭环管理，压实防控责任，充实防控力量，健全常态化防控机制，补齐短板弱项，筑牢外防输入防线。要加强重点场所常态化防控，督促学校、养老院以及机场、火车站等人员密集场所和单位压实责任，强化日常监测和防控要求，做实做细防控措施和应急预案。要扩大重点人群监测覆盖面，加强药店、诊所、教育机构、农贸市场等服务人员健康监测，发挥医疗机构等“哨点”作用，完善多渠道监测预警机制，推广“抗原筛查、核酸诊断”监测模式，全面提升疫情监测预警和应急反应能力。要统筹区域核酸检测力量的调配使用，备足隔离点并建立储备清单和梯次启用机制，做好方舱医院建设的方案和准备工作，提升应急处置能力。要严格落实验码、测温、戴口罩、保持社交距离等常态化防控措施，继续有序推进老年人疫苗加强免疫接种，筑牢群防群控防线。
做好疫情防控工作，直接关系经济社会大局稳定；保持经济平稳运行和社会和谐稳定，才能为坚持常态化疫情防控提供坚实支撑。必须深刻认识到，常态化疫情防控不是孤立的政策，而是一套复杂的运行体系，既不能对不同地区采取“一刀切”的做法、阻碍正常的经济社会秩序，又不能不当放松防控、导致前功尽弃。各级党委和政府要把思想和行动统一到党中央决策部署上来，进一步磨砺责任担当之勇、科学防控之智、统筹兼顾之谋、组织实施之能，切实提升阻断疫情传播的速度和力度，坚决守住不出现疫情规模性反弹底线。要继续做好“六稳”“六保”工作，持续改善民生，着力稳定宏观经济大盘，保持经济运行在合理区间，保持社会大局稳定。要全力保障货运物流特别是医疗防控物资、生活必需品、政府储备物资、邮政快递等民生物资和农业、能源、原材料等重要生产物资的运输畅通，切实维护人民群众正常生产生活秩序。疫情形势越是严峻，越要保持战略定力，一手抓战“疫”，一手抓发展。统筹好疫情防控和经济社会发展，采取更加有效措施，努力用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果，我们就一定能最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响。
实践已经证明，我们完全有基础、有条件、有能力实现“动态清零”。当前正是疫情防控最吃劲的关键时期，尤需坚定信心、迎难而上，严格落实好常态化疫情防控各项举措，决不能让来之不易的疫情防控成果付之东流。让我们更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，凝心聚力，攻坚克难，完善常态化疫情防控和突发疫情应急处置机制，尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延势头，坚决打赢常态化疫情防控这场攻坚战持久战，实现疫情防控和经济社会发展双胜利。

讲课人是红河州开远市非公经济组织联合党委书记代红辉。20年前，代红辉靠着一张只有名字的名单，大海捞针一样把倒闭企业的失联党员找了回来。
从当初只有15人的党支部，发展成如今覆盖297家非公经济组织、拥有348名党员的非公经济组织联合党委，这些年来，代红辉带着大家壮大党员队伍、设立助学金、支援疫情防控，充分发挥了党员先锋模范作用。
“我们真的找到家了”
2002年，开远市乡镇企业局下属的6家企业相继倒闭停产，企业职工自谋出路，其中一些党员难以正常参加组织生活。那一年，上级党委任命49岁的代红辉为乡镇企业局综合党支部书记，随后相关负责人交给她一项重要任务：按照名单把失联党员再组织起来。
当时对党务工作还不太熟悉的代红辉一看名单就愣住了，总共15个人的名单，除了名字以外别无其他信息。没地址、没联系方式，该上哪儿找？代红辉眉头紧蹙。一阵犹豫后，她还是咬牙答应了。“既然党组织把任务交给了我，我就有责任完成好这项工作。”
拿着名单，代红辉来到当地公安局户籍科。经过排查，她得到了一份68人的名单和对应的住址。“同名同姓的太多，有3个‘刘寿春’，5个‘白丁友’……”代红辉说。
从市区到乡村，从西山到东山，代红辉的脚上磨起了泡，短暂休整后又接着找。一天傍晚，代红辉来到开远市崇文街21号，这是名单上最后一个“刘寿春”的家。敲门无人应，代红辉试着从门缝里塞进一张纸条：“刘寿春同志，我是你所在党支部的现任书记，请你与我联系，我的传呼机号是……”
下班回家，看到地上的纸条，刘寿春立马找了台座机打过去。一番周折，两人终于通上了话，建立了联系。
在刘寿春的帮助下，代红辉历时48天，走了300多公里路，名单上的其他党员也被一一找到。第一次集中开会时，党员们说：“我们真的找到家了。”
“想给人一杯水，自己要有一桶水”
党员找回来后，代红辉向上级党委申请学习资料，一头扎了进去开始学习。从党史知识到中央最新文件，她都要先自己反复钻研明白，再讲给支部的同志们听。
“想给人一杯水，自己要有一桶水。”代红辉说。通过讲解和探讨，大部分同志进步很快。可也有不少人提出质疑：“白天上班已经很辛苦了，晚上学习有没有必要抓这么紧？”每每听到这样的声音，代红辉一改平常的好脾气，严肃地一遍遍劝说。
日子久了，越来越多人找到代红辉，向党组织递交入党申请书。随着党员数量增多，2011年，经上级党组织批准，开远市乡镇企业局综合党支部改为党总支；2015年，开远市成立非公经济组织联合党委，党员人数达到177名。
非公经济组织联合党委大多数党员是企业主、个体户，起初个别党员常以要谈生意为由开会请假。为了提高大家的积极性，代红辉探索用好学习积分制：每月学习1次，不参加扣1分；扣分超过3分，党支部书记对其进行谈话教育……
除了扣分，参加社会公益活动还可以加分。党员张元利做汽车配件生意20多年，他坦言：“以前做生意只考虑自己，自从认识了代书记，受她的影响，我会主动参与一些公益活动，为社会多做些贡献。”前段时间，他特意买了桌椅、饮水机、零食等放在店门口，让城市里的清洁工、快递员在工作之余能有个歇脚的地方。“量化评分不是为了争高低，而是希望党员们心里能有杆秤，时刻记得自己的责任和义务。”代红辉说。
“我做的还不够，以后要加倍努力”
代红辉已经69岁了，干起党务工作来依然动力满满。有一次，代红辉去外地讲党课，课前不慎摔倒，她忍痛坚持讲了两个小时。代红辉说：“那么多人来听党课，我来都来了，就要把课讲完。”
代红辉的辛苦，大家都看在眼里。刘寿春常跟代红辉说：“你现在的身体状况太差了，必须马上去检查身体。”众人反复劝说下，代红辉这才去医院做了详细检查。
长年奔波劳累，代红辉的膝盖落下了半月板磨损的老毛病。疫情防控期间，代红辉贴着膏药，和党员们一起在一线值守卡点。开远街头，一个一瘸一拐的身影，奔波在社区、街道和医院。
与此同时，党员们所在的企业和商户还自发组织捐赠活动，向开远市红十字会捐赠防护用品、食品及爱心善款近百万元。为了让更多人感受到党组织的温暖，从2006年起，代红辉就和当时支部的党员们一起，捐款帮助困难学生。2012年，“金秋圆梦”助学金成立，多年累计捐款金额超过300万元。
毕业于中国刑事警察学院的孔涛，如今是红河州绿春边境管理大队的一名见习民警。当年他申请到“金秋圆梦”助学金后，代红辉担心沈阳冬天冷，自掏腰包给他买了一件厚毛衣。她常对孔涛说：“不要担心家里的情况，好好读书，家里我帮你照看。”
2018年，孔涛向学校党组织递交了入党申请书。写好申请书后，他第一时间告诉了代红辉，代红辉很高兴。如今，孔涛定好计划，将自己的部分工资定期捐给“金秋圆梦”助学金。孔涛说：“当初是代阿姨帮我圆了梦，我也想把梦想传递下去。”
去年，代红辉被评为“全国优秀党务工作者”。回首过去20年，她却说：“我做的还不够，以后要加倍努力。”

世界卫生组织最新数据显示，截至4月14日，全球新冠肺炎确诊病例数累计超过5亿，死亡病例数逾619万。世卫组织强调，新冠肺炎大流行仍是国际关注的突发公共卫生事件，并建议各国随时做好准备，加强公共卫生应对措施，遏制病毒传播。
世界卫生组织新冠肺炎大流行突发事件委员会在4月13日公布的会议结果中认为，新冠肺炎大流行继续构成“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件”。多国公共卫生专家反复强调，新冠肺炎疫情大流行远未结束，预计新冠病毒仍将继续演变，人们将看到更多的变异毒株出现，疫情防控的不确定性依然很高，过早放松社交限制措施存在很大风险。
“随着时间推移，新冠病毒更具传染性且仍具致命性，对于那些无法获得医疗保障和抗病毒药物、未受保护和未接种疫苗的人来说更是如此”
世卫组织最新发布的疫情周报显示，在4月4日至10日，全球新增确诊病例数和死亡病例数连续第三周下降，但是病毒传播依然保持在高位。世卫组织强调，对这种下降趋势应该谨慎解读，因为一些国家正改变检测策略，导致检测数量减少，报告确诊病例也相应减少。此外，各个国家和地区病例检测、纳入标准、测试策略、报告方式及数据截止、滞后时间不同，也会造成各方发布的数据存在差异。
世卫组织总干事谭德塞在日前举行的信息通报会上说，各国报告死亡病例数减少，但新冠肺炎疫情大流行还远未结束。新冠病毒传播率仍然很高，许多国家的疫苗接种率依然很低。一些国家和地区放松了公共卫生和社交限制措施，造成病毒继续传播，并带来新病毒变种出现的风险。“一些国家仍出现了严重的病例激增情况，这给医院带来压力。由于新冠病毒检测数量显著减少，我们监测疫情趋势的能力受到影响。”
谭德塞强调：“随着时间推移，新冠病毒更具传染性且仍具致命性，对于那些无法获得医疗保障和抗病毒药物、未受保护和未接种疫苗的人来说更是如此。”他呼吁，尽可能在早期诊断高危患者，以便抗病毒药物发挥作用，并进一步提高抗病毒药物的可及性。此外，保持高水平的核酸检测及病毒基因测序对于追踪现有病毒变种、识别新的病毒变种至关重要。
世卫组织新冠肺炎大流行突发事件委员会建议，因新冠肺炎疫情导致住院人数、重症监护人数以及死亡人数增加，并影响到卫生系统的处置能力，各国应继续采取基于证据和风险的公共卫生和社交限制措施，如戴口罩、居家隔离、勤洗手和改善室内通风等，并随时准备根据病毒和人口免疫力的变化迅速强化相关措施。
“一些国家因新冠疫苗接种率高等因素认为疫情已经结束，这种想法是危险的，不能忽视奥密克戎毒株带来的威胁”
根据世卫组织的评估，由于威胁人类健康的风险依然存在，且各国依然面临病毒传播风险和控制能力不足的挑战，目前全球公共卫生风险等级“非常高”。近期，多个国家和地区发布的数据也显示，新增确诊病例持续保持高位，出现新一波疫情风险依然存在。
数据显示，截至目前美国仍是累计新冠肺炎确诊和死亡病例最多的国家，其确诊病例数超过7971万，死亡病例数超过97.9万，这两个数据的全球占比均为近16%。累计确诊病例较多的国家还有印度、巴西、法国、德国、英国等10多个国家，这些国家各自累计确诊的病例数都超过千万。
在世卫组织划分的全球六大区域中，欧洲地区和美洲地区累计确诊和死亡病例数均排前两位，迄今其报告的确诊病例分别高达2亿多例和1.5亿多例，死亡196万多例和271万多例。这两个地区合计占全球累计新冠肺炎确诊和死亡病例的比例分别超过72%和75%。
当前，新冠病毒仍在快速传播。世卫组织目前正密切关注一些奥密克戎亚型毒株，包括BA.2、BA.4和BA.5，以及BA.1和BA.2的重组毒株。博茨瓦纳和南非的科学家近期检测到了奥密克戎毒株的新亚型，已标记为BA.4和BA.5。但由于样本和测序数量有限，目前仍不清楚它们的传播力和危险性。世卫组织还在追踪多种重组毒株，包括德尔塔毒株亚型AY.4与奥密克戎毒株亚型BA.1的重组毒株XD，以及奥密克戎毒株的亚型BA.1与BA.2的重组毒株XE等。
世卫组织卫生紧急项目执行主任迈克尔·瑞安表示，预计新冠病毒仍将继续演变，人们将看到更多的变异毒株出现。“新冠病毒此前曾让我们措手不及，因此我们需要尽可能地追踪病毒”。
世卫组织卫生紧急项目技术负责人玛丽亚·范凯尔克霍弗表示，“奥密克戎是一种温和的毒株”“新冠肺炎大流行已经结束”“奥密克戎是最后一个新冠变异毒株”等有关疫情的错误信息大量传播，造成了很多混乱。谭德塞强调，“一些国家因新冠疫苗接种率高等因素认为疫情已经结束，这种想法是危险的，不能忽视奥密克戎毒株带来的威胁”。全球范围内病毒还在快速传播，很容易出现传染性更强、更危险的变种，疫情防控的不确定性依然很高。
“过早放松社交限制措施存在很大风险，必须持续加强检测，继续采取有力措施，最大限度遏制病毒传播”
连日来，多国公共卫生专家警告说，新冠病毒仍在持续变异，疫情形势存在不确定性，过早放松社交限制措施存在很大风险。包括欧美在内的许多国家和地区大幅放宽甚至解除社交限制措施，引发多方担忧。
泛美卫生组织主任卡丽萨·艾蒂安日前表示，虽然美洲大部分地区新增确诊病例数减少，但北美洲以及加勒比地区部分国家新增感染人数仍然较多，疫苗接种鸿沟将使该地区在下一波疫情发生时处于危险之中。她敦促各国不应忽视疫情加剧的风险，继续做好疫情监测，防患于未然。
英国国民保健制度联合会首席执行官马修·泰勒认为，当前疫情防控仍然面临诸多不确定性，应以科学为指引，谨慎出台放松措施。
比利时病毒学家马克·范·兰斯特表示：“疫情远未结束，过早放松社交限制措施存在很大风险，必须持续加强检测，继续采取有力措施，最大限度遏制病毒传播。”否则一旦出现疫情严重反弹，很可能不得不重新加强社交限制措施。
英国研究人员在新一期《全球健康杂志》发表的一项研究认为，美国与英国在新冠肺炎大流行前被认为是对流行病准备最充分的国家，但实际情况不及预期。在“寿命损失年数”这个指标上，美国的总体寿命损失年数最高，为10289624，按人口比例计算也位居前列。“寿命损失年数”反映了新冠病毒导致的与预期寿命相比的过早死亡情况。在每1000人中因新冠病毒死亡人数这个指标上，英格兰和威尔士在所研究的20个国家和地区中最高，达到2.39。
不少媒体刊文批评，以西方国家为代表的一些国家和地区大幅放松防控措施，实际上是将新冠肺炎疫情大流行当作“地方流行病”对待。美国州与地区卫生官员协会执行总监迈克尔·弗雷泽认为，用“地方流行病”形容新冠肺炎疫情“不好理解，也不准确”。
美国全国县市卫生官员协会首席执行官洛里·弗里曼说：“我们尚未解开新冠病毒的所有谜团，谈论结束疫情是一种错误的论断。如果发现另一个病毒变种或新一波疫情，必须准备好重新采取防控措施。”
迈克尔·瑞安明确表示，新冠肺炎疫情还没有成为一种季节性的或可预测的模式，应非常谨慎监测。即便未来疫情成为“地方流行病”，也应该最大限度遏制疫情传播，否则将会夺去成千上万人的生命。

把握点多、面广、频发的近期疫情传播特点，巩固来之不易的抗疫成果，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响，迫切需要我们提高科学精准防控本领。疫情防控中，从党员、干部到医务工作者、疾控工作人员、人民解放军指战员、武警部队官兵、科技工作者、社区工作者、公安民警、应急救援人员、志愿者，从严从实开展防控工作，顶住了一轮又一轮疫情的冲击，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康。当前，国内外疫情防控具有复杂性、艰巨性、反复性的特点，本轮疫情中主要流行的奥密克戎变异株传播速度特别快、隐匿性极其强、无症状感染者和轻症病例占比非常高，对高龄患者、合并严重基础病患者等特殊人群具有潜在严重威胁，给疫情防控工作带来了新的挑战。越是在这个时候，越要保持头脑清醒，疫情发现要更早，疫情处置要更快，落实防控措施要更实，服务群众要更到位。只有坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，态度更坚决、更果断，行动更迅速、更有力，才能尽快打赢这场大仗硬仗。
同疫情作斗争，是物质的角力，也是精神的对垒。面对疫情反复冲击，有的人心生“松口气、歇歇脚、等等看”的想法，容易对常态化防控和应急处置在思想上放松要求、在行动上放宽尺度，我们要高度重视和警惕。与奥密克戎变异株这种病毒搏斗，必须坚决采取果断措施，快字当头、以快制快，才能尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延势头，否则就可能“一篙松劲退千寻”，丧失已有防控成果。必须认识到，“人民至上、生命至上”是我国疫情防控的根本出发点和落脚点，在与传播力强的变异株多次殊死较量后，我们要更加坚定坚持“动态清零”总方针。当前疫情形势依然严峻复杂，必须慎终如始，时刻绷紧疫情防控这根弦，始终保持定力、保持斗志，对疫情传播的警惕性不能降低，对疫情防控的措施要求不能降低，坚决克服麻痹思想、厌战情绪、侥幸心理、松劲心态，铸就起团结一心、众志成城的强大精神防线。
提高科学精准防控本领，必须主动担当、积极作为，抓细抓实疫情防控各项举措。当前，吉林省各市州均已实现疫情防控社会面清零目标，事实证明，我们不仅有“动态清零”的经验，而且具备“动态清零”的能力。各地区各部门各方面要坚决把思想和行动统一到党中央决策部署上来，党政同责，齐抓共管，切实做到守土有责、守土尽责。要加快核酸检测、方舱医院建设、感染者收治，尽快阻断社会面疫情传播。要强化风险管控，快速筛查，找出潜在传染源，及时转运隔离。对于疫情较为严重的地方，党政主要领导和各级领导干部要把防疫工作放在第一位，尽锐出战，决战决胜。要把初心落在行动上、把使命担在肩膀上，从紧从严、从早从快、从细从实落实各项防控措施，筑牢疫情防控的坚固屏障。
基层是联防联控、群防群治的第一线，是确保各项措施落实到位的关键所在。一段时间以来，各条战线坚守岗位、连续作战，十分辛苦、极为不易，为遏制疫情扩散蔓延作出了重要贡献。各级党委和政府要多关心关爱，及时帮助他们解决遇到的实际困难和问题。要坚决纠正形式主义、官僚主义做法，坚持一切从实际出发，减轻基层负担。要推动防控资源和力量下沉，时刻关注社区防控工作缺什么、难在哪，多解决问题、多提供支持，做好工作、生活、安全等各方面保障。要充分调动各方面积极性主动性，工作上支持、待遇上保障、心理上关怀，进一步激发干劲和斗志，让大家把更多精力投入到疫情防控第一线，把更多时间用在抓工作落实上来。
统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展，坚持科学精准、动态清零，任务十分繁重，不仅需要宽肩膀，也需要铁肩膀。坚决贯彻落实习近平总书记关于疫情防控工作的重要指示精神和党中央决策部署，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针，不断提高科学精准防控本领，以科学之策应对非常之事，以精准之措应对非常之难，在大战中践行初心使命，在大考中交出合格答卷，我们一定能打赢常态化疫情防控这场攻坚战持久战，切实守护人民群众生命安全和身体健康。

普陀区甘泉路街道名都居民区党总支书记朱雪萍，已经连续工作了一个半月。她是上海最早投身抗疫的居民区党组织书记之一。
早在2月28日晚9点，因有一例本土确诊病例住在居民区内的西部名都花园，小区实施封闭管理，此后14天，约1500名居民共同“居家抗疫”。
“平时办公不在这个小区，但疫情就是命令！”朱雪萍带领4名社工立刻“逆行”进入小区，50多名机关干部、社工和社区民警也紧急加入。
为准确掌握和上报整个小区封控人员的信息，朱雪萍带领工作组严格落实管控措施，精心安排工作环节。小区内公共的室内区域面积不大，14天里，大部分工作人员都挤在一间活动室里休息，朱雪萍则干脆把车后座当成“床”，睡了近半个月。
3月中旬，该小区如期解封，但居民区内另一老旧小区又出现了阳性人员，朱雪萍马不停蹄，再次投入战疫，直到现在。
47天“连轴转”，50多岁的朱雪萍声音沙哑，每天仍在组织居民核酸筛查并帮助配药、协调物资……“最让我欣慰的是，很多90后站了出来，作为志愿者冲在一线，让我刮目相看”，朱雪萍说，两个小区共5000余名居民，有130多名志愿者帮助工作，解决了很多棘手难题。
封控时间长了，很多居民遇到困难都找朱雪萍，一天24小时，除了后半夜，几乎电话不断。她说：“居民的希望都在我们身上，一定要尽最大的努力帮助大家解决困难，奋战到胜利。”
陈家巷居民区党总支书记卢晓燕：
用“笨办法”采样，“辛苦不怕，只要把事做好”
“我们居民区比较特殊，除了一个集中的小区外，其他都是沿马路的独栋房屋。”长宁区陈家巷居民区党总支书记卢晓燕说。53岁的她，自3月底启动“战疫状态”后，一直在坚守。
2400多户人家，居民有3900多人，包括她在内，社区工作人员仅11人，其中两人还被封控在浦东家里。
“好在志愿者很给力！”卢晓燕说，自3月20日居民区陆续出现阳性人员并启动封控措施后，先后有180多名居民报名成为志愿者。
居民区内有几栋高层建筑，核酸筛查采样时，居民区根据人员分布，每次布置3到4个采样点位，按楼栋一个一个开展，实行分批、分层有序错时下楼采样。这样的“笨办法”，花费时间很长，但能够尽量避免人员聚集。
“凌晨一两点睡觉是常态，早上五六点钟就要起来，”卢晓燕说，“辛苦不怕，只要把事做好。”
封控时间长了，配药成为很多居民最关心的事情。卢晓燕安排了两组配药的志愿者，一组配常用药，一组配比较特殊的药品，尽最大努力满足居民用药需求。
“居民配合度很高，我们特别感谢”，卢晓燕说，志愿者和居委会干部们的工作时间几乎一样，各种物资、药品只要出现在小区门口，就有人主动去帮居民配送，“这让我对战胜疫情很有信心。”
和睦村党总支书记俞林辉：
小喇叭喊得嗓子失声，“动员所有能动员的力量”
青浦区赵巷镇和睦村地处远郊，虽不像中心城区人口那么稠密，但疫情发生得早，村里3303名常住人口中，外来人口多达2698名，占比超过八成，管控压力着实不轻。
“主动担当，积极作为，这时候，党员干部就要坚决守护好村民健康。”和睦村党总支书记俞林辉说起话来干脆爽利。
早在3月7日晚11点，俞林辉收到赵巷镇防控办通知，和睦村7组发现一名无症状感染者，需要马上对7组作封闭管控。他赶紧通知同事们返岗，连续多夜守在卡口上。大家劝他休息一下，他坚决不肯离岗，“最关键时刻，我是老党员，应该带头。”在3次全员核酸检测均为阴性后，他才稍稍松了口气。
和睦村7组外来人口多，流动性大，情况较为复杂，俞林辉连夜指挥逐户排查，直至凌晨4点，7组一户一档人员信息基本排摸清楚，为防疫工作部署提供了第一手资料。
后来，赵巷镇启动48小时内2次核酸检测，和睦村采取相对封闭式管理。检测期间，恰逢大雨，俞林辉带领班子成员连夜冒雨布置好场地，动员村民提前准备好核酸检测登记码和雨具，发动各组组长提前帮老人登记并打印好采样二维码。
核酸采样现场，俞林辉拿着小喇叭，和志愿者一起维持秩序，大雨如注，引导工作更加艰难。他一遍遍向村民“喊话”，两轮核酸下来，嗓子已经喊哑，几乎发不出声。“看到秩序不乱，村民平安，就值得了！”
4月13日，记者在和睦村采访时，正赶上村里给大家发放食用油，人群在志愿者指挥下有间隔地排好队。
这一天，1500份保供生鲜物资从江苏无锡运抵赵巷镇，是由红豆上海公司党支部提供的。“看到俞书记他们冲锋在前，作为外来党员，我们也想发挥作用。”红豆上海公司党支部书记张雪茹说，除了保供，他们还组织党员先锋队到村报到，协助开展疫情防控。
“一家人，共战斗，我们要动员所有能动员的力量。”俞林辉说，“大家齐心协力，肯定能胜利！”

米面油菜送达！一车车食物运抵站台。
煤炭石油进港！一艘艘货轮停靠码头。
眼下，上海这座超大城市正鏖战在疫情防控最紧要的关键阶段。吃饭问题、能源安全、防疫需要……每一件都事关千家万户，每一件都离不开交通保障。
千难万险何所惧，大战大考炼真金。一边是严峻挑战，一边是民生所盼。“水陆空”齐上阵，“白加黑”连轴转，交通运输业全力以赴保障生产生活物资运送和产业链供应链畅通。
抢时间，加班加点运输急需物资
连飞13班！4月7日，从下午2点半到晚上10点半，在福建福州长乐国际机场，几乎每半小时就有一架载有防疫物资的厦航包机起飞。防护服、防护口罩、核酸检测试剂……当天，随福建省援沪医疗队一同启程的，还有一大批防疫物资。
“时间紧、任务重。班次如此密集，这还是头一次。”执行运输任务，厦门航空党委书记、董事长赵东靠前指挥，“上海疫情牵动着我们的心，尽管有诸多挑战，但我们克服重重困难，选派业务能力过硬的党员骨干队伍带头执飞。”
“前一天晚上接到任务，我们连夜动员。除了8班客包机，又专门追加了5班‘客改货’包机，全力保障5500多件、近70吨物资的运送。”厦门航空福州分公司副总经理黄振扬说。
由于上海实行全域静态管理，食物需求十分紧迫。关键时刻，铁路从各地送来了大量食品。
来自20多个省份的蔬菜、方便面、食用油、大米等物资源源不断发往上海。据统计，3月30日至4月10日，由铁路运抵上海的各类保供物资达978车、3.2万多吨。铁路部门对民生物资优先卸车、优先出货，尽力压减配送时间。
依托北粮南运等运输通道，中远海运集团一面紧急调配船舶资源，一面筹集集装箱箱源，第一时间研究落实“陆改水”方案，以解米面油运输的燃眉之急。
4月6日凌晨，装载300吨东北大米的“钱海83”船舶抵达上海外高桥码头。“我们的‘昌盛集5’以及‘惠金桥598’等船舶也已完成大米装船，正全速驶向上海。”中远海运集运旗下泛亚航运副总经理黄飞舞介绍，3月20日以来，泛亚航运已完成东北至上海的粮食运输超过15艘次，总计约1800吨。
除了粮食，能源保供也必不可少。3月29日，“银致”轮装载5.55万吨煤炭从黄骅港运至上海石洞口第一电厂；4月5日，“嘉禾航运1”轮5.07万吨煤炭从京唐港运至上海外高桥第三电厂……“我们全力为上海六大主力电厂提供运煤保障。”中远海运散运董事长、总经理顾劲松说，截至4月10日，中远海运散运公司已从北方港口向上海运输煤炭15船，约50万吨。石油运输方面，3月25日以来，中远海运能源公司已完成上海5个航次的石油运输任务，共计23.9万吨。
保畅通，努力保障产业链供应链稳定
上海是重要的国际口岸，也是国内国际产业链供应链的重要节点。疫情当前，如何稳链保畅？各方动用科技力量、精简优化流程、转变运输方式，多措并举、多招并用，努力满足企业生产所需。
有的企业产品出不去，有的企业材料进不来……面对多种困难，中远海运集团千方百计完成运送：有些货物提前安排进指定仓库并送往码头；有的依靠独山码头的海河资源，结合公路运输，向洋山港运送货物；还有些货物通过“公转铁+水水中转”的方案，将货柜运至外高桥码头顺利出运。目前，有来自苏州、镇江、无锡、南京、湖州等多地的货物成功转运，涉及电器、光伏、机械等行业的大型企业。
疫情限制了人员流动，但数字化连起了网上桥梁。中远海运集团下属中远海运集运利用区块链等技术，开展线上订舱、换单、提放箱等业务，有效帮助稳外贸。中远海运物流“远海通”智能关务平台，开放24小时远程服务，实现客户委托、下单、派发及制单申报全过程无纸化操作。“目前，我们的船舶在上海港靠泊、装卸作业和离泊总体平稳有序。”中远海运集运全球海运操作中心总经理王斌说。
在上海浦东国际机场，也有不少科研、生产急需物资需要通过海关查验。“货代报关员来不了现场，我们就多做些事情。”上海机场集团航空物流发展公司副总经理孟迅说，浦东机场地区建立了“无人陪同”查验模式，货主无需到场，只需通过电子方式传输信息，机场海关就能在留守作业现场的货站或货代工作人员协助下完成查验。
为加快运输效率，浦东机场货站还开通了特殊物资“绿色专用通道”。孟迅介绍，目前进港货物中包括大量企业急需的芯片、集成电路、光刻胶、汽车零配件等，走绿色通道可实现优先消毒、优先理货、优先分拨、优先提货，提货时长节省6至7小时。
“上海的保供稳链，关系着全国的生产。这些紧缺电子元器件将运往江苏、安徽、湖北等地。最近还到了一批种子，也将投入各地春耕生产。”孟迅说。
海铁联运班列，在保供稳链中发挥着独特优势。4月10日上午8时，某企业6个集装箱的液晶显示屏从安徽抵达上海芦潮港站，随后装船出海发往墨西哥。“眼瞅着要延期了，临时从公路运输改海铁联运，好在没耽误时间。”企业负责人说。
严防控，加强站场港口防疫闭环管理
在中国铁路上海局集团有限公司北郊站，从早上5点半到晚上10点，一直有卡车频繁进出拉货。“最近延长了货运开放时间，多拉一车货，就多一些人早点拿到物资。”上海货运中心北郊经营部主任张龙说。
顺利保供的前提是做好防疫。3月底，北郊站的工作人员就实行了闭环管理。他们吃住在单位，工作时身穿防护服，佩戴防护口罩，再戴上橡胶手套，在高温下“全副武装”保障物资运送。
保供稳链越是紧要，交通枢纽就越要安全。“浦东机场是上海的门户，目前境外货物运输量仍较大，尽管知道要和家人分别很长时间，但闭环人员依然选择留下来，继续坚守门户。”浦东机场防疫总监曹流透露，目前，浦东机场有近万人封闭作业，他们来自机场、航司、地服、海关、边检等单位。“大家都在全力维持机场正常运转。”
曹流介绍，为加强防疫安全，机场各岗位每天进行核酸检测加抗原检测。比如负责配餐的员工，从进货、切配到做饭、打包，每个人都要先检测再上岗。
记者了解到，上海浦东国际码头等重要港区也已实施闭环管理，外来物品进入港区一律消毒，所有区域每日消毒4次。此外，中远海运集团还有大量船员家在上海，特殊时期，中远海运船员公司全面摸排2400多名上海船员及其家庭情况，提醒他们做好防护，并对封控船员及家庭及时提供慰问和帮助。

与病毒赛跑，方向正确、跑得越快，就越能掌握战“疫”的主动权。“动态清零”的精髓，一是快速，二是精准，立足抓早、抓小、抓基础，发现一起就扑灭一起，守住不出现疫情规模性反弹的底线。常态化疫情防控以来，正是因为始终坚持“人民至上、生命至上”理念，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针，我们顶住了一轮又一轮疫情的冲击，快速有效处置数十起局部地区聚集性疫情，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康，有力保障了我国经济发展和疫情防控处于全球领先地位。事实充分证明，快速和精准的“动态清零”，正是我国控制疫情的有效法宝；“动态清零”体现的是尊重科学、尊重规律，路子是对的，效果是好的。
“动态清零”是由我国基本国情所决定的，是我们党坚持把人民生命安全和身体健康放在第一位的必然要求。新冠肺炎疫情发生后，一些西方国家虽然医疗技术全球领先，但却因采取所谓“群体免疫”“自然免疫”的消极应对处置方式，导致感染和病亡人数居高不下。有的国家宣布“与新冠病毒共存”计划以来，住院人数和死亡病例激增，感染人数持续保持高位。我国拥有特殊的人口国情，这就决定了积极应对疫情、实现“动态清零”十分必要。必须清醒认识到，奥密克戎变异株绝不是“大号流感”，其危害性决不能低估。我国地域广阔、人口众多，各地医疗卫生条件存在差异，疫苗接种在不同人群之间存在不平衡性，加上老年人口基数大，如不及时从严防控，势必令易感人群感染风险加大，最终将形成规模性反弹，后果不堪设想!
确定抗击疫情最佳方案，关键在于如何用更小成本在更短时间内控制住疫情，减少疫情带来的不利影响，以良好的防控成效保障经济社会持续健康稳定发展。我国坚持“动态清零”，为的是尽一切努力来维护人民生命安全和身体健康，尽一切可能有效精准平衡疫情防控和正常生产生活及经济社会发展。为了实现“动态清零”，对疫情严重的地方采取封控、管控等措施，势必会给人们生产生活带来不便，但只要快速控制住疫情，就可以也能够换取更长时间的正常生产生活和更大范围甚至全国的正常生产生活。可以说，“动态清零”是现阶段基于我国当前疫情形势的最佳选择，坚决果断采取有力防控措施、力争在短时间内做到“动态清零”，依然是最经济、最有效的疫情防控策略。
目前我国新增本土感染者数量仍处于高位，部分地区社区疫情传播仍未阻断，波及影响范围依然很大，防控正处于关键紧要时期。疫情形势越是严峻，越要保持战略定力，越要继续坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，以时不我待的精神抓实抓细疫情防控各项工作。要看到奥密克戎变异株具有传播速度快、隐性感染和轻症病例比例高等特点，更容易造成大范围的传播。如果错失抗疫的最佳时机，导致疫情传播面扩大，付出的代价会更高，对经济社会和人民健康造成的损失会更大。只有做到“动态清零”，才能消除疫情隐患，避免大规模人群感染可能造成的医疗资源挤兑，预防老人、有基础疾病者等可能出现的死亡。只有快字当头，以快制快，加紧推进应检尽检、应收尽收、应隔尽隔、应治尽治，落实早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗要求，才能快速控制局部聚集性疫情，保持经济社会正常运行，用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果。
当此疫情防控的关键时期和胶着状态，尤须坚定信心迎难而上，发扬苦干实干、连续作战的精神，以更坚决更果断的措施，在与病毒赛跑中赢得主动。在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，亿万人民团结一心，将疫情防控工作抓实抓细，我们完全有能力实现“动态清零”，一定能尽快打赢抗击疫情这场大仗硬仗!

574,反亚裔种族歧视甚嚣尘上坐实美国种族主义社会本质,NA;,5,4/16/22,1030,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruXxYU7GZUdhm7HuumE9rkE2UyKgHEgNXB8BFZwG1wZ1TSCrBHRr3A3m3-18mMrw7C_EmgYJrDyBQPvQ3MjP92Z3nyh-wNV4uCCvzXMAbzGJYxgT9K3sLIKf&uniplatform=NZKPT,"长期以来，美国主流社会给亚裔贴上“模范少数族裔”的标签，极力营造不存在针对亚裔种族歧视的假象。然而在新冠肺炎疫情大流行的背景下，部分美国政客肆无忌惮的种族主义言论，以及美国社会针对亚裔愈演愈烈的种族主义攻击，已经撕下了这层虚幻的面纱。2021年3月16日，美国亚特兰大地区连续发生3起针对亚裔的枪击案，共导致包括6名亚裔女性在内的8人死亡。这一惨案是美国近年来针对亚裔歧视、暴力现象不断升级的后果。
美国的反亚裔事件如同那里的新冠肺炎疫情一样持续肆虐。“停止仇恨亚裔及太平洋岛民”组织2021年11月18日发布的报告显示，2020年3月19日至2021年9月30日，该组织共收到10370起针对亚裔的种族主义攻击事件报告，大多数事件发生在街道、工作场所等公共空间。纽约市警察局2021年12月8日发布的数据显示，该市2021年针对亚裔的仇恨犯罪比2020年猛增361%。有媒体报道说，纽约实际发生的针对亚裔的仇恨犯罪案件远远高于以上公布的数量，因为许多受害者并没有向警察局报告立案。《经济学人》周刊和舆观调查公司2021年3月联合进行的民意调查数据显示，70%的受访者认为亚裔在美国受到严重歧视，其比例甚至高于非洲裔。“肤色在决定美国人的命运方面，显然具有举足轻重的作用”——美国社会这个铁律再次得到了印证。冰冷的现实映照出，美国在骨子里依然是一个白人盎格鲁—撒克逊新教徒的国家，亚裔同非洲裔、拉美裔、原住民一样，在享有和实现人权的诸多方面受到有形无形的歧视和侵害。
一、美国亚裔正在遭受愈演愈烈的种族主义攻击
新冠肺炎疫情这场严重的公共卫生危机，为检视美国社会种族歧视问题提供了一个直观透明的窗口。非洲裔与拉美裔成为美国新冠肺炎疫情的直接受害者，他们的感染率和死亡率要远高于白人群体；而亚裔则不幸沦为美国新冠肺炎疫情的间接受害者，他们是伴随着疫情而日益猖獗的种族歧视言行的主要攻击目标。加州州立大学圣贝纳迪诺分校“仇恨与极端主义研究中心”的统计数据显示，2020年美国整体仇恨犯罪案件较2019年下降了7%，然而针对亚裔的仇恨犯罪却激增149%。2021年第一季度美国15个大城市针对亚裔美国人的暴力犯罪相比2020年同一时期增长了169%。
近两年来，美国针对亚裔的种族主义攻击频发，案情令人触目惊心。
——2020年3月14日，得克萨斯州一名男子在超市里持刀攻击一户亚裔家庭，试图杀死他们全家，被刺伤者中甚至包括两岁和六岁的儿童。
——2020年7月14日，纽约一名89岁的华裔妇女在街边行走时，突然遭到两名陌生男子扇耳光。当她试图逃离时，攻击者却从背后点燃了她的衣服。
——2021年1月28日，一名84岁高龄的泰裔男子在旧金山被蓄意猛烈撞击重摔倒地，最终因伤势过重而不幸死亡。
——2021年3月16日，21岁的白人男子罗伯特·亚伦·朗持枪袭击亚特兰大地区3家亚裔经营的按摩店和水疗中心，共造成8人死亡，其中6人是亚裔女性。
——2021年8月30日，一名菲律宾裔老年女性在纽约皇后区雷哥公园地铁站内遭一名白人男子推下楼梯，脸部和身体严重受伤。
——2021年11月17日，费城3名华裔高中生在放学乘地铁回家时遭到种族主义袭击，当地警方表示，“受害者之所以被选中很明显是因为他们是亚裔”。
…………
《纽约时报》在2021年4月3日一篇题为《愈演愈烈的反亚裔暴力》的长篇报道中写道，“在过去一年里，在一系列明显带有种族敌意的事件中，亚裔被推搡、被殴打、被踢踹、被唾面、被辱骂，甚至连房屋和商店也遭到破坏。”根据亚裔遭受种族主义攻击的不同形式，该文将搜集整理的案件分为三类。第一类是亚裔遭受身体攻击的案件，例如遭遇殴打、胡椒喷雾袭击或者被吐口水，许多亚裔受害者因此身心受重创；第二类是亚裔遭受口头攻击的案件，主要是一些带有种族主义性质的侮辱性言论；第三类是亚裔受害者的财产遭受破坏的案件，例如房屋、店面被破坏，或被喷涂上种族歧视标语。事实上，该报道也只是揭露了过去一年中亚裔所遭受种族主义攻击的冰山一角。令人震惊的是，就在这些种族主义行径开始引发美国社会的关注与抗议之际，针对亚裔的攻击行为还在持续不断地发生，其中妇女和老人等弱势群体成为重点攻击对象。
二、美国亚裔被歧视被排斥的历史仍在延续
长期以来，美国针对亚裔的种族歧视之所以未引起足够重视，一方面是因为在非洲裔与白人之间的种族冲突过于引人注目，另一方面则是美国主流社会意图掩盖历史上亚裔的悲惨遭遇。美联社曾坦言，“针对亚裔美国人的种族主义，一直是美国历史上的丑陋主线”。
美国华裔的命运是亚裔遭受歧视和迫害的缩影。亚洲人移民美国的历史始于19世纪中叶，当时他们因美国经济社会发展急需廉价劳动力而远渡重洋来到这个国家。19世纪后期，在政客的鼓动与媒体的渲染下，亚裔被污名化为“黄祸”，被主流社会视为对美国白人的“种族威胁”“经济威胁”“健康威胁”，美国对亚裔的排斥和攻击达到一个顶峰。在美国历史上的各个时期，亚裔持续遭受着偏见、仇恨和种族暴力的折磨和煎熬。早在1854年，美国联邦最高法院就在判例中判定亚裔不能成为美国公民，对亚裔获得公民权的限制直到二战前后才最终被取消。对亚裔的群体暴力的最早记载是1871年，一伙白人冲进洛杉矶唐人街附近街区，枪击和绞死了21名华裔；亚裔社区被焚毁，居民被赶出城市。对亚裔的恐惧和偏见最终导致美国禁止亚裔移民美国：华裔移民在1882年开始受到《排华法案》的限制；日裔在1907—1908年间开始受到移民限制；到1924年所有亚裔都被禁止移民美国。亚裔在公共卫生事件中被当成替罪羊在美国历史上也不新鲜，早在19世纪70年代旧金山暴发天花疫情之时，华裔就曾被诬称为“罪魁祸首”。
亚裔在美国的悲惨历史未能得到公正的清算和反思，甚至不为美国主流社会所知晓，因而其中所潜藏的种族主义恶意自然无法彻底消除。亚裔被塑造为美国种族关系的局外人，美国主流社会中很多人否认存在针对亚裔的种族歧视历史，更拒不承认当前存在针对美国亚裔的种族主义攻击。华裔历史学家李漪莲在美国国会关于针对亚裔种族仇恨犯罪的听证会上发言说：“当今亚裔美国人和太平洋岛民面临的种族歧视和暴力的行为并非由精神错乱的个人随意犯下的罪行，而是一个系统性的国家悲剧。它反映了美国针对亚裔美国人的系统性种族主义的悠久历史。”对于美国各地针对亚裔暴力事件的增加，联合国秘书长古特雷斯表示深感关切，“过去一年发生的数千起事件，是长达数百年来刻薄、刻板化、寻找替罪羊、剥削和虐待历史的延续。”
对亚裔的种族歧视之所以从历史延续到现在，深刻体现了美国社会对亚裔作为“弱者”的欺凌以及作为“他者”的排斥。美国亚裔整体力量的弱小使其成为种族主义欺凌的目标。亚裔“弱者”地位主要体现在以下几个方面。第一，亚裔人口总量相对较少。美国亚裔总人口约为2400万，在美国总人口中所占比例约为6%，与白人、非洲裔、拉美裔相比都存在较大差距。第二，亚裔人口内部异质性很强。美国亚裔指的是来自东亚、东南亚及南亚数十个国家的移民及其后代，而这些国家的文化遗产、经济状况、政治体系、宗教习俗和语言的差异很大，导致亚裔内部的异质性极强。第三，亚裔群体内部的认同感和凝聚力不强。亚裔这个共同的身份认定在很大程度上是外部社会强行赋予的结果，多数亚裔甚至并不愿意接受属于单一亚裔种族的身份。人口数量少、内部差异大、群体凝聚差，再加上政治参与低，使得亚裔长期以来在遭遇整体性种族歧视时缺乏反抗的能力，而默默承受的弱者形象又使得亚裔更易成为种族主义攻击的对象。
美国亚裔外来者的身份认定使其成为种族主义排斥的目标。亚裔遭遇愈演愈烈的种族歧视也与疫情之下美国排外主义情绪高涨有关，因为亚裔在美国主流社会中某种意义上被认定为永久的“外来者”和“他者”。一方面，美国亚裔人口的增长很大程度上是由于移民而不是自然增长，大量亚裔的出生地在美国之外。另一方面，大部分亚裔与美国主流社会和主流文化保持着一定的距离。因此我们可以看到在针对亚裔的种族主义攻击中，“滚出我们的国家”“滚回自己的国家去”“离开这里”“你们不属于这里”的排外主义表述极为常见。种族主义者甚至将这种“外来者”的认定视作发动针对亚裔种族主义攻击的合理性支撑，这在美国社会中具有相当的民众基础。正如一位亚裔美国人所言：“新冠肺炎疫情提醒我们，我们的归属是有条件的。前一刻我们还都是美国人，下一刻我们就是‘把病毒带到这儿来的外国人’。”
三、疫情大流行背景下反亚裔种族主义甚嚣尘上的原因
（一）美国政客对新冠肺炎疫情的种族主义操弄
美国政客对新冠肺炎疫情的种族主义操弄是美国社会针对亚裔的种族歧视日渐猖獗的直接动因。美国前任总统特朗普擅长利用种族因素达成自己的政治目的，其执政4年间不断操弄种族主义议题，导致美国种族紧张局势不断加剧。随着美国因防控不力逐渐沦陷为全球新冠肺炎疫情的重灾区，特朗普和蓬佩奥等一众美国政客出于推卸责任及竞选的需要，多次采用“中国病毒”等带有地域指称性而非国际公认的名称来指代新型冠状病毒，并千方百计地将本国疫情的蔓延归咎于中国。受美国政客种族主义操弄的影响，那些被认为是华人或其他东亚血统的人士遭受到各种形式的种族主义攻击，如恶意诽谤、拒绝提供服务及野蛮暴力对待等。联合国当代形式种族主义问题特别报告员滕达伊·阿丘梅指出，“那些试图将新冠病毒归咎于特定国家或族裔的领导人正是那些奉行民族主义和民粹主义、将带有种族主义和仇外心理的花言巧语作为其政治平台核心的领导人”。白宫现任新闻秘书普萨基在解释美国当下反亚裔情绪高涨时也承认：“特朗普政府的伤害性言论是导致对亚裔美国人威胁增大的原因之一，并且影响很大。”特朗普下台后，美国政府继续操弄和炒作病毒溯源政治化议题，客观上也使得美国国内反亚裔情绪保持在高位状态。
（二）美国白人至上的种族结构与社会氛围
疫情下美国亚裔所遭受的仇视和排斥境遇，与非洲裔、拉美裔等少数族裔长期遭受的种族歧视一样，最终根源都在于美国白人至上的种族结构和社会氛围。亚裔群体长期以来一直在美国社会处于边缘位置，许多美国人甚至没有意识到或者没有勇气承认美国长期存在针对亚裔群体的种族歧视问题。在“模范少数族裔”标签的遮盖之下，亚裔与其他少数种族同样面临着系统性的种族歧视。白人至上主义者并没有因为亚裔的“模范表现”而网开一面：针对亚裔的种族仇恨犯罪中，75%的攻击者是白人；针对亚裔的仇恨犯罪同样在白人占主导地位的地区发生最为频繁；特朗普、蓬佩奥等白人政客是蓄意将新冠肺炎疫情的祸水引向亚裔的始作俑者。美国主流社会对于亚裔遭受的种族歧视，长期以来都呈现出漠视与掩盖的态度。2020年9月，164名美国共和党议员投票反对国会通过谴责针对亚裔歧视的法案。很多针对亚裔的恶性暴力攻击事件，如九旬老人被纵火焚烧案、华人在曼哈顿街头被刺案，都未能以“仇恨犯罪”的性质来立案。在“3·16”亚特兰大枪击案发生之后，当地警方发言人杰伊·贝克在发言中否认案件的种族仇恨犯罪性质，并出言为枪手辩护，称“其度过了糟糕的一天”。
（三）亚裔“模范少数族裔”标签的羁绊
在20世纪60年代中后期美国黑人民权运动风起云涌的社会背景之下，一批描述日裔、华裔等亚裔族群获得成功的故事相继登上了美国主流报纸杂志。在美国政界、学界和媒体界的共同推动之下，亚裔被贴上了“模范少数族裔”的标签。客观而言，“模范少数族裔”的标签承认了亚裔通过自身艰苦卓绝的努力所取得的成就，也一定程度改善了亚裔在美国长期遭受的污名化困境。然而很多分析指出，“模范少数族裔”只是美国主流社会炮制的“又一个强化种族等级、保护歧视行为的谬论”，对于亚裔自身而言“名为光环，实为枷锁”。其一，“模范少数族裔”使得亚裔面临的种族歧视不受重视甚至不被承认。“模范少数族裔”塑造了亚裔经济收入高、教育程度高的刻板印象，这个标签使得他们通常不被纳入美国种族歧视讨论的范畴。在“成功种族”的光环之下，亚裔群体在经济社会上所面临的困境同样被忽视，如亚裔老年人13.5%的贫困率远高于美国平均水平，亚裔失业之后再就业周期几乎是所有种族中最长的，亚裔在政界、工商业界、学术界、法律界的领导层中代表性明显不足，等等。其二，“模范少数族裔”消解了亚裔对种族歧视的感知能力与反抗精神。美国主流媒体塑造之下的亚裔具有“独立、聪明、勤奋、顺从、从不发表政见”的品德，他们的文化价值观念被认为与美国新教伦理相契合。这种貌似褒奖的话语体系甚至赢得了相当多亚裔的认同，使得他们愿意按照被期望的形象和品质来低调行事。内化了这套话语的亚裔面对种族歧视时缺乏敏感性，甚至羞于承认遭受种族歧视的事实。其三，“模范少数族裔”话语恶化了有色人种内部的关系，成功转移了种族矛盾的焦点。“模范少数族裔”这一概念将亚裔捧上神坛，同时也暗含着对非洲裔隐喻性的批评，其目的正是为了打击当时势头强劲的美国黑人民权运动。这种极具种族分化功效的策略使得有色人种内部产生了尖锐的矛盾，亚裔自此成为很多少数种族群体的指责或攻击目标。
（四）美国种族关系的对立
研究发现，尽管所有少数种族遭受的攻击都主要来自于白人群体，但亚裔比非洲裔和拉美裔更容易遭受到来自其他少数种族的攻击。亚裔遭受攻击的施害者75%系白人，还有25%则系其他少数种族。这一事实在一定程度上揭示了美国种族秩序的复杂性及美国种族关系的对立。非洲裔等对亚裔群体攻击的增加，一方面是由于美国部分政客和媒体对新冠肺炎疫情的种族主义操弄，导致社会上形成了一种特定的种族敌对氛围。在美国政客“甩锅”战术的诱导之下，亚裔成了“替罪羊”和“出气筒”。另一方面，这也是美国亚裔社区与非洲裔社区之间长期对立的反映。美国主流社会对“模范少数族裔”的塑造，文化传统价值观念上的差异，就业等社会资源上的竞争，历史上种族冲突事件的印痕等，造成亚裔与非洲裔之间深深的隔阂与误解。非洲裔和亚裔正在共同遭受明显的种族不公正，然而互不信任的种族关系却使得亚裔更加无力摆脱当下的困境。与“黑人的命也是命”运动中其他种族踊跃参与支持相比，亚裔反种族歧视游行示威中其他种族出席与支持的程度则明显不够。
（五）美国政客破坏中美关系的政治诱因
历史多次证明，来自不同国家的移民及其后代在美国的处境深受美国与其母国关系的影响。一旦美国与某国的关系紧张，针对该国移民及其后裔的歧视就会甚嚣尘上。例如，一战期间的德裔、二战期间的日裔、“9·11”事件之后的穆斯林国家移民在美国都曾遭遇到极为严苛的对待。早在新冠肺炎疫情暴发之前，特朗普政府就不断对中国采取遏制与打压的政策，发表攻击中国政治制度、损害中国主权的极端言论，掀起对华贸易战、科技战，鼓吹中美脱钩，致使两国关系遭遇严重挑战。受此影响，华裔在美国开始遭遇越来越多的歧视性对待，最为典型的是针对华裔知识分子的审查与迫害。新冠肺炎疫情在美国蔓延之后，特朗普政府为了掩盖疫情应对不力，不断使用种族主义言论攻击中国。在造成中美关系进一步恶化的同时，也使得包括华裔在内的整个亚裔群体面临更为严重的种族歧视。拜登政府上台之后，将中国作为主要战略竞争对手，这也是当下美国反亚裔情绪依旧处于高位的动因之一。依此推断，后疫情时代即便美国社会针对亚裔整体的种族歧视可能会有所消退，但针对华裔群体的种族攻击反而可能会愈演愈烈。这不得不引起我们的隐忧和警惕，也需要国际社会持续关注。

一、铸牢中华民族共同体意识、推进民族团结进步，是贯彻落实总体国家安全观的内在要求
习近平总书记强调，只有铸牢中华民族共同体意识，才能有效应对实现中华民族伟大复兴过程中民族领域可能发生的风险挑战，才能为党和国家兴旺发达、长治久安提供重要思想保证。广西作为全国少数民族人口最多的自治区，少数民族人口占比39%，壮族是全国人口最多的少数民族，各民族长期以来亲如一家，民族关系十分融洽，是全国民族团结进步示范区。我们深入学习贯彻习近平总书记关于加强和改进民族工作的重要思想，贯彻落实总体国家安全观，把铸牢中华民族共同体意识作为推动民族团结进步的根本要求，作为凝心聚力建设新时代中国特色社会主义壮美广西的生命线、幸福线，进一步总结好、运用好、发展好民族团结进步的成功经验，齐心协力建设中华民族共有精神家园、共同富裕幸福家园、守望相助和谐家园、边疆稳定平安家园。
中华民族共同体意识是民族团结之本。习近平总书记强调，只有铸牢中华民族共同体意识，才能增进各民族对中华民族的自觉认同，夯实我国民族关系发展的思想基础，推动中华民族成为认同度更高、凝聚力更强的命运共同体。我们牢牢抓住铸牢中华民族共同体意识这条新时代党的民族工作的主线，在全国民族团结进步模范的基础上，建设铸牢中华民族共同体意识示范区，专门出台《关于建设铸牢中华民族共同体意识示范区推进新时代全区民族工作高质量发展的实施意见》，深入开展“壮族三月三·和谐在八桂”等铸牢中华民族共同体意识宣传教育，既做看得见、摸得着的工作，也做“润物细无声”的事情，有形、有感、有效，引导各族人民牢固树立休戚与共、荣辱与共、生死与共、命运与共的共同体理念，牢固树立正确的国家观、历史观、民族观、文化观、宗教观，推动“三个离不开”“五个认同”更加深入人心，促进各民族像石榴籽一样紧紧抱在一起，构建起维护国家统一和民族团结的坚固思想长城。
各民族广泛交往交流交融是中华民族共同体建设的重要途径。习近平总书记强调，加强各民族交往交流交融，尊重差异、包容多样，让各民族在中华民族大家庭中手足相亲、守望相助。广西有壮、汉、瑶、苗、侗等12个世居民族，各民族自古以来就有“同顶一片天、同耕一垌田、同饮一江水、同建一家园”的优良传统，“十口之家、情融五族”比比皆是。我们大力传承弘扬各民族优秀文化，加强对天琴艺术、侬峒节等非物质文化遗产传承发展，维护边疆民族地区文化安全。依托边境地区爱国主义教育基地等平台载体，抓好民族团结进步创建“十百千”工程，推动各民族共居共学、共建共享、共事共乐，和睦相处、和衷共济、和谐发展，共同维护好国家安全和社会稳定。
促进各民族共同繁荣发展是铸牢中华民族共同体意识的重要基础。习近平总书记强调，各民族共同团结进步、共同繁荣发展是中华民族的生命所在、力量所在、希望所在。我们聚焦实现好、发展好、维护好各民族根本利益，毫不动摇坚持和完善民族区域自治制度，健全完善民族政策和地方法规体系，建立健全各族群众诉求表达、利益协调、权益保障机制，妥善处理涉及民族因素的案事件，依法保障各族群众合法权益。统筹抓好边疆治理、巩固脱贫成果、推进乡村振兴等，深入推进固边兴边富民行动，加大对少数民族聚居区基础设施建设、产业结构调整支持力度，补齐就业、教育、医疗等社会事业发展短板，推动各民族稳步迈向现代化，不断增强各族群众获得感、幸福感、安全感。
二、提升应急处置能力、保持社会和谐稳定，是贯彻落实总体国家安全观的应有之义
习近平总书记指出，“公共安全是国家安全的重要体现”“应急管理是国家治理体系和治理能力的重要组成部分，承担防范化解重大安全风险、及时应对处置各类灾害事故的重要职责，担负保护人民群众生命财产安全和维护社会稳定的重要使命”。广西山地丘陵和岩溶地貌广布，各类自然灾害和道路交通等事故隐患交织叠加、易发多发。我们坚持底线思维，强化忧患意识，把加强应急管理体系和能力建设作为贯彻落实总体国家安全观的基础性工作，把防范风险的先手与应对化解风险挑战的硬招结合起来，把打好防范抵御风险的有准备之战与打好化险为夷、转危为机的战略主动战结合起来，既防范“灰犀牛”，又高度警惕“黑天鹅”，努力用大概率思维防范小概率事件，牢牢守住不发生系统性风险的底线，保持社会大局安全稳定，为凝心聚力建设新时代中国特色社会主义壮美广西营造良好环境。
强化风险监测预警是首要。习近平总书记强调，坚持从源头上防范化解重大安全风险，真正把问题解决在萌芽之时、成灾之前。我们深刻认识到，预防是最经济、最有效的风险治理策略，把防风险摆在突出位置，坚持预防与应急并重、常态与非常态结合的原则，充分运用大数据、云计算、人工智能、区块链等现代科技手段，加快“数字平安广西”建设，深化“雪亮工程”建设应用，推动应对突发公共事件从以应急处置为重点转向全过程风险管理，努力将矛盾消解于未然、将风险化解于无形。坚持和发展新时代“枫桥经验”，做好市域社会治理现代化试点工作，全面推行“综治中心+网格化+智能化”社会治理模式，完善社会矛盾纠纷多元预防调处化解综合机制，努力把大矛盾大风险化解在市域、小矛盾小风险化解在基层、苗头性问题隐患解决在网格，筑牢防灾减灾救灾的人民防线。
提升应急能力是关键。习近平总书记考察广西时强调，要严密防范各种风险挑战，有效遏制重特大安全生产事故。我们把加强突发公共事件快速响应能力建设摆在突出位置，抓好自治区、市、县、乡四级应急指挥中心（平台）建设，加快推进信息报送“一张网”、指挥调度“一键通”、应急救援“一张图”，加强多种方式、各类规模的应急培训演练，推动“防”和“救”的责任链条无缝对接、形成整体合力，构建统一指挥、专常兼备、反应灵敏、上下联动的应急管理体制，确保对突发公共事件快速反应、有效处置。强化突发公共事件舆论引导能力，牢牢掌握舆论引导主动权和主导权，着力营造应对突发公共事件的有利社会环境。
抓好队伍建设和应急保障是基础。习近平总书记多次强调，“要加强应急救援队伍建设”“提升应急物资储备和保障能力”。我们以中国—东盟应急管理合作基地建设为契机，健全完善以国家综合性消防救援队伍为主力、军队应急力量为突击、专业应急力量为协同、社会应急力量为辅助的应急救援力量体系，加快建设区域应急救援中心，完善各类队伍共训共练、指挥协同、救援合作等机制，打造应急救援尖刀和拳头力量。加强应急物资装备支撑，建立健全统一的应急物资保障体系，不断提高应急管理的科学化、专业化、智能化、精细化水平。
三、慎终如始抓好疫情防控、维护边疆巩固安宁，是贯彻落实总体国家安全观的紧迫任务
习近平总书记指出，重大传染病和生物安全风险是事关国家安全和发展、事关社会大局稳定的重大风险挑战。广西同东盟国家陆海相邻，是我国面向东盟开放合作的前沿和窗口，要毫不放松抓好常态化疫情防控，慎终如始做好“外防输入、内防反弹”工作。我们把抓好疫情防控作为当下守好祖国“南大门”、维护国家安全的重中之重，深入贯彻落实“及时发现、快速处置、精准管控、有效救治”疫情防控要求，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针不动摇、不放松，坚持人民至上、生命至上，严格压实属地、部门、单位、个人四方责任，突出“四早”要求，全面提高科学精准防控水平。
当前，全球新冠肺炎疫情仍在高位流行，国内疫情多点散发、局部暴发，广西面临着境外疫情外溢和国内其他省份疫情扩散的风险。我们强化系统思维，坚持做严一线、做实二线、做强全线，形成对新冠病毒梯次拦截、全面阻击的坚固防线。做严一线，即严格管控边境线，对入境的“人”和“物”进行严格检查；做实二线，即扎实做好入住登记、通行亮码、测温、戴口罩等基础工作，把防控基础打牢固，发挥好兜底作用；做强全线，即强化全域防控，加强疫情防控应急处置能力建设，全力支持一线、二线地区做好疫情防控各项工作。
境内外、海陆上、近远端联动。加强境内外联动，发挥好广西与越南边境四省建立的跨境疫情防控沟通协调机制作用，加强疫情防控合作，在确保安全的基础上，保持边境口岸通关作业，保障中越边境口岸贸易畅通。加强海陆上联动，打“蛇头”、堵通道、断链条、摧网络，加大对“三非”人员、“三无”船舶的打击力度，管住入境的人、管好边境的人、管牢离境的人，全方位全链条阻断境外疫情输入风险。加强近远端联动，远端加强国外远端防控，近端加强边境口岸防控，强化边境疫情应急处置和防控救治能力建设，凝聚起打赢疫情外防输入阻击战的强大合力。
以“防”为主、以“管”为要。“防控”是与疫情斗争成本最小、跑在时间前面的有效举措。我们坚持以“防”为主，重在平时，坚持外防输入、内防反弹，落实好疫情防控各类“十严格”措施，坚持人、物、环境同防，把网格化管理摆在更加突出的位置，推行“党建+网格”的管理模式，确保人在“网”中走、事在“格”中办，充分调动群众的积极性主动性，构筑起疫情防控的人民防线。强化联防联控机制，盯紧盯牢境外和国内风险地区来桂返桂人员，加强对跨境货车司机、挂靠出入境船舶等薄弱环节的管理，严格抓好冷链货物全面消杀和监管。对发生疫情的市、县，在做好“防”的基础上，突出以“管”为要，重兵合围、尽锐出战，实施分级分区分类管控，做到“快速精准”和“重点覆盖”有效融合，最大限度把疫情控制在最小范围，在最短时间内实现社会面动态清零。

我国是一个有着14亿多人口的大国，防范化解重大疫情和重大突发公共卫生风险、确保人民群众生命安全和身体健康，始终是我们党治国理政的一项重大任务和须臾不可放松的大事。常态化疫情防控以来，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，我国坚持人民至上、生命至上理念，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针，快速有效处置数十起局部地区聚集性疫情，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康，我国疫情防控以最小成本取得了最大成效，经济发展和疫情防控保持全球领先地位。我国的抗疫实践充分证明，“动态清零”符合国情、符合科学、有效可行，是对人民至上、生命至上理念最好的践行。
近期，我国多省份面临同时段多地发生以奥密克戎变异株为主的疫情防控局面，防控形势严峻复杂。越是在这样的时候，越要坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇。从奥密克戎变异株的特性看，虽然其本身的致病性不及其他毒株强，但具有传染性强、传播速度快、隐匿性高等特点，无症状和轻症感染者较多，更容易造成大范围的传播。如不及时从严防控，势必令易感人群的感染风险加大，造成医疗资源挤兑，后果不堪设想。从我国现实国情看，60岁及以上人口达2.67亿，还有超5000万老人未完成新冠疫苗全程接种。以我国庞大的总人口基数、庞大的老年人群体规模，如果“躺平”，不管“防”，只管“治”，不仅会让高龄患者、合并严重基础病患者等特殊人群面临病毒的严重威胁，还可能形成规模性反弹，让来之不易的疫情防控成果大打折扣，甚至付之东流。可以说，坚持“动态清零”，是坚持人民至上、生命至上理念的必然选择，是14亿多人口大国当前务必守住的疫情防线。
疫情防控关系每个人的生命安全和身体健康，没有人是旁观者，每个人都是责任人。应当看到，常态化疫情防控是一项艰巨繁重又需要持久坚持的工作。坚持意味着十分艰辛的付出、极度疲累的坚守、咬紧牙关的挺住，特别是疫情形势严峻的地方采取有关封控、管控等举措，给人们的工作、学习和生活带来一些不便，但这是病毒逼迫我们作出的不得已的应对之举，也是实践证明行之有效的应对之策。从长远看，一时的不便，是为了更长久的方便；局部的坚守，是为了更大范围、更广泛的百姓正常生产生活。依法支持和配合疫情防控工作，既是在保护自己，也是在保护他人，既能减少交叉感染风险，也是在为疫情防控大局做贡献。
当前，疫情仍在高位运行，波及范围进一步扩大，防控正处于关键紧要时期。各地区各部门各方面必须继续坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，坚定必胜信心，更加坚决果断，把各项防控措施落实到每一个环节。“动态清零”的精髓，一是快速，二是精准。要比病毒跑得更快，以快制快，真正把防控措施落细、落小、落实。要针对病毒变异的新特点，提高科学精准防控本领，完善各种应急预案，严格落实常态化防控措施。要保持群众正常生产生活平稳有序，做好生活必需品生产供应，保障好群众就医需求。各地区各部门各方面要坚决把思想和行动统一到党中央决策部署上来，党政同责，齐抓共管，做到守土有责、守土尽责。疫情较为严重的地方，党政主要领导和各级领导干部要坚持把防疫工作放在第一位，尽锐出战，决战决胜。各级党组织和广大党员、干部要继续积极发挥作用，坚持深入防控一线，深入群众，用心用情用力帮助群众排忧解难。
坚持就是胜利，坚持才会胜利，坚持定能胜利。经过45天的艰苦鏖战，吉林省各市州均实现了疫情防控社会面清零目标。这再次证明，我们完全有基础、有条件、有能力实现“动态清零”。在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，保持战略定力，以“咬定青山不放松”的韧劲、“越是艰险越向前”的拼劲，继续攻坚克难、顽强奋战，积小胜为大胜，我们一定能打赢常态化疫情防控这场攻坚战持久战，有力有效保障人民群众生命健康和经济社会发展。

继续抓好海南自由贸易港建设总体方案和海南自由贸易港法贯彻落实
2018年4月，习近平总书记郑重宣布，党中央决定支持海南全岛建设自由贸易试验区，支持海南逐步探索、稳步推进中国特色自由贸易港建设，分步骤、分阶段建立自由贸易港政策和制度体系。
“时隔4年，总书记再次到海南考察，对推进自由贸易港建设做出重要指示，我们备受鼓舞、倍感振奋！”海南省委副秘书长、省委深改办常务副主任王磊说，海南将坚持“闯”为基调、“稳”为基础，“继续抓好海南自由贸易港建设总体方案和海南自由贸易港法贯彻落实，把制度集成创新摆在突出位置，强化‘中央统筹、部门支持、省抓落实’的工作推进机制，确保海南自由贸易港如期顺利封关运作。”
作为海南自由贸易港先行区、示范区，洋浦经济开发区先后实施了20多项制度创新。洋浦经济开发区管委会副主任张勇军说：“我们要大胆创新、先行先试，继续为全岛封关运作做好压力测试。”
“总书记特别提到，要坚持维护国家安全不动摇，加强重大风险识别和防范，统筹改革发展稳定，坚持先立后破、不立不破。”海口海关关长施宗伟说，“我们一定要加强重大风险识别和防范，全力确保全球动植物种质资源引进中转基地建设的风险防控。”
数字海南有限公司承担着海南省电子政务基础设施、公共平台和共性平台的建设运维工作，董事会秘书曹献媛表示，未来将进一步加强网络安全攻防演练，防止黑客攻击、信息泄露、数据滥用，“确保安全有序，提升自由贸易港大数据平台的风险防控能力。”
贯彻新发展理念、推动高质量发展，把海南更好发展起来
“近年来，海口抢抓海南建设自由贸易试验区和自由贸易港的重大历史机遇，聚焦发展旅游业、现代服务业、高新技术产业、热带特色高效农业为主导的现代产业，加快构建现代产业体系，全面提升经济质量、效益和核心竞争力。”海口市副市长刘立武说，“我们一定按照总书记的要求，贯彻新发展理念、推动高质量发展，把海南更好发展起来。”
2018年以来，海南生态软件园已成长为海南发展数字经济的主要平台和载体，目前入园企业逾万家。党委书记杨淳至说：“我们将严格贯彻新发展理念、推动高质量发展，围绕区块链、数字健康等产业，瞄准颠覆性创新项目，重构产业新生态。”
“海南热带雨林国家公园是国宝，是水库、粮库、钱库，更是碳库。”海南省林业局（热带雨林国家公园管理局）局长黄金城说，要贯彻落实习近平总书记的重要指示，“坚持生态立省不动摇，把生态文明建设作为重中之重，对热带雨林实行严格保护，实现生态保护、绿色发展、民生改善相统一，向世界展示中国国家公园建设和生物多样性保护的丰硕成果。”
“去年，离岛免税经营主体总销售额超过600亿元，海南离岛免税‘金字招牌’越擦越亮。”海南省商务厅厅长陈希说，海南将依托国内超大规模市场优势，营造良好市场环境和法治环境，继续做大离岛免税产业，“积极对接国际高水平经贸规则，不断提高贸易投资自由化、便利化水平，形成更大范围、更宽领域、更深层次对外开放格局。”
深入推进农业供给侧结构性改革
“我们深入推进农业供给侧结构性改革，加强农业全产业链建设，严守生态保护红线、永久基本农田、城镇开发边界3条控制线。”海南省农业农村厅厅长何琼妹表示，“十四五”期间，海南立足热带农业特色优势，突出高质量发展方向，保供给、强素质、促融合，“打造高质高效的热带现代农业产业集群，进一步提升热带特色高效农业的国际竞争力。”
中国科学院院士、海南省崖州湾种子实验室主任杨维才说。“总书记指出，中国人的饭碗要牢牢端在自己手中，就必须把种子牢牢攥在自己手里。我们一定要继承和发扬老一辈农业科研工作者胸怀祖国、服务人民的优秀品质，拿出十年磨一剑的劲头，勇攀农业科技高峰。”
橡胶是海南的特产，也是海南农民增收的重要渠道。海南省农垦投资控股集团有限公司党委书记、董事长盖文启表示，海南省大力推进城乡及垦区一体化协调发展，完善天然橡胶产业扶持政策，“我们将做好天然橡胶产业规划，增强天然橡胶供应的稳定性，为保证国家战略物资供应做贡献。”
越是深化改革、扩大开放，越要加强精神文明建设
“习近平总书记强调，越是深化改革、扩大开放，越要加强精神文明建设。这一点，我们深有感受。”海南省委宣传部副部长陆海鹰表示，要持之以恒抓好全社会的理想信念教育，“大力培育和弘扬社会主义核心价值观，广泛开展群众性精神文明创建活动，不断提升人民文明素养和社会文明程度。”
三亚国际免税城刚刚喜迎离岛免税品累计销售突破千亿元大关，中免集团三亚国际免税城客服部工作人员宋亮说：“习近平总书记强调，要加强诚信建设，倡导遵纪守法、诚实守信的社会风尚。我们将进一步加强诚信建设，深入开展‘诚信经营·放心消费’活动，助力三亚打造国际旅游目的地。”
“志愿服务是社会文明进步的重要标志，是广大志愿者奉献爱心的重要渠道。”海口市琼山区新时代文明实践中心志愿者张树源说，“我们将以群众需求为导向，开展更丰富的文明实践活动，吸引更多的社会团体和个人参与到志愿服务中。”
用心用情用力解决好人民群众的急难愁盼问题

美国的疫情应对政策正陷入“收紧—放开—疫情恶化—再收紧—再放开”的恶性循环，一个重要原因在于科学问题被政治化。随着美国联邦政府及各州陆续取消抗疫措施，美国公共卫生专家对疫情在美国再次大规模反弹表示担忧，强调消极抗疫只会对民众的生命健康造成更大危害。
近期，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例数再次出现上升趋势。美国流行病学家表示，由于美国政府削减了新冠病毒检测力度和相关补贴，疫情数据统计不完全等因素可能使美国日增确诊病例数等指标被严重低估，使疫情严重程度被“掩盖”。
美国多地新冠肺炎感染病例数激增
美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学4月14日发布的新冠肺炎疫情最新统计数据显示，截至美国东部时间14日，美国累计新冠确诊病例超过8000万例，累计死亡病例接近98.8万例。美国是全球累计确诊病例数和累计死亡病例数最多的国家。
美媒统计显示，自3月底以来，首都华盛顿哥伦比亚特区的病例翻倍，纽约市病例激增逾60%。另据美国儿科学会网站4月4日报道，截至3月31日的一周，美国新增儿童新冠肺炎确诊病例27521例，累计已有超过1284万名儿童确诊。此前4周，全美新增儿童确诊病例超过13万例。
美国全国广播公司援引的统计数据显示，过去两周，内布拉斯加州新冠肺炎确诊病例增加了近80%，亚利桑那州增加了75%，马萨诸塞州增加了55%。此外，废水新冠病毒浓度监测数据表明，科罗拉多州、俄亥俄州和华盛顿州等地的感染率也正在上升。
数据显示，感染奥密克戎毒株亚型BA.2的相关病例占美国新增病例的86%，其中超过90%的感染者在纽约州、马萨诸塞州等地。美国媒体分析认为，政府防疫资金告急导致新冠病毒检测力度减弱，加之众多州过快取消疫情防控措施，是当前美国疫情激增的主要原因。
美国《时代周刊》报道说，美国现在可能正处在病例激增中，而人们并不知情。多名美国卫生专家批评美国政府“自欺欺人的防疫举措”。
美国《新闻与世界报道》杂志网站说，美国公共卫生专家福奇称，由于具有更强传播性的奥密克戎变异毒株持续蔓延，加之防疫措施有所放宽，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例数量上升的趋势令人担忧。
削减防疫支出将给疫情应对带来压力
在美国感染人数激增、医疗机构承受巨大压力的背景下，美国相关机构却计划大幅削减应对新冠肺炎疫情的资金投入。
近日，美国国会参议院宣布了一项100亿美元的新冠肺炎疫情一揽子援助计划，规模较此前提出的225亿美元的方案大幅削减，而且取消了原方案中总额50亿美元的国际抗疫援助资金。美国国内舆论批评说，如果计划资金被大幅削减，将导致美国无法应对疫情带来的多重压力，妨碍全球抗疫进程。
美国“政客”新闻网报道说，参议院决定将该计划的投票推迟到4月国会两周休会期之后再进行。报道说，援助计划规模之所以被大幅削减，是因为民主党和共和党在边境政策方面僵持不下。美国哥伦比亚广播公司指出，新冠肺炎救助法案落入了党争陷阱。
“美国抗击新冠肺炎疫情的资金告急”，《纽约时报》指出，向那些没有医疗保险的人提供新冠疫苗、检测和治疗的资金正在耗尽。报道说，如果没有资金投入，更多的美国人可能会感染新冠病毒，这不仅会导致本可避免的生命损失，还会让医院不堪重负。随着拯救生命的工具越来越远离弱势群体和有色人种社区，医疗卫生差距可能进一步恶化，“美国此举最终将损害民众生命健康”。
消费者维权组织“公共公民”研究主任扎因·里兹维批评说，美国计划削减全球抗疫援助，将对全球疫苗接种、减少病毒变异风险产生“毁灭性的后果”。放弃承担援助全球抗疫责任，将让美国人的生命健康处于危险之中，“美国已经背弃了世界”。
抗疫政治化导致多重恶果
彭博社报道认为，由于美国政府停止了对新冠病毒检测项目的补贴，成规模的病毒检测力度大幅减弱，人们更多依赖家庭快速检测方式，这使得公共卫生官员很难准确掌握疫情的真实传播范围。“美国正处于新一轮疫情激增期中而不自知”。
美国《福布斯》杂志网站报道说，美国21个州“迫不及待”要求取消乘客在搭乘公共交通工具时佩戴口罩的规定。文章评论说，过早取消“口罩令”可能导致新冠肺炎病例激增，而本次疫情最大的悲剧之一就是美国疫情应对措施政治化问题。
美国医学专家彼得·霍特兹撰文指出，美国反科学浪潮高涨，一些政治势力难辞其咎。《政治杂志》特约撰稿人德里克·罗伯逊说，在美国，关于新冠肺炎防疫措施和疫苗强制令的争论早已脱离科学范畴，成为经年累月文化分歧的宣泄口。
美国民众因为政府混乱的抗疫政策已经付出了巨大的代价。美国《大西洋月刊》网站4月12日报道称，美国近100万人死于新冠病毒，意味着数百万人失去亲人。他们需要数月甚至数年的时间来应对悲伤和失去亲人的痛苦。然而，新冠肺炎死者中大多数为穷人、有色人种等弱势群体，这类家庭最缺乏心理和健康护理。

创新办赛激发参与热情
推动群众体育、竞技体育和体育产业协调发展
开展群众喜闻乐见、丰富多彩的全民健身赛事和活动，是实现全民健身、促进全民健康的主要途径。《“十四五”体育发展规划》提出“运动项目普及推广工程”，要求发挥全国性单项体育协会的主体作用，积极探索不同运动项目的推广模式，不断扩大项目参与人数。
据中国羽毛球协会常务副秘书长冯平善介绍，中国羽协及时转变观念，鼓励支持地方部门和社会力量办赛，变“一家办”为“大家办”，将赛事品牌授权给各省市羽协使用。这一举措充分调动了办赛积极性，各项赛事的规模得到了进一步扩大。“以往我们自己办赛，一年举办赛事大约50站。部分主办权交给地方后，一年可以举办约100站。建立积分赛体系之后，2022年第一批申请的比赛就已经超过200站。显著增加了群众性赛事供给，有效提高了各级羽毛球群众性赛事组织水平。”冯平善说。
充分发挥大型赛事的综合价值，创新赛事举办方式，激发人们参与体育的热情，带动更多人参与全民健身，推动群众体育、竞技体育和体育产业协调发展。
广东省连续两届全运会均在群体项目上取得优异成绩。“我们以‘抓项目、办比赛、树品牌’做大做强体育社会组织，再依靠社会力量办运动队、扩大项目影响力和群众基础，在龙舟项目上实现参赛项目金牌满贯，在毽球、网球、轮滑、三人篮球等项目上取得重大突破。”广东省体育局副局长麦良说。
回应“健身去哪儿”问题
扩大增量、盘活存量，建设更多群众身边的场地设施
与人民群众日益增长的健身需求相比，健身场地设施总量不足、分布不均、利用不充分等矛盾依然存在，“健身去哪儿”仍是亟待回应的问题。国家体育总局群众体育司司长丁东说，建设更多群众身边的场地设施，既要扩大增量，引导支持各地新建体育场馆设施、补齐短板，也要盘活存量，组织实施公共体育场馆开放补助资金管理办法及其配套政策。
山东省青岛市城阳区田村小学为方便附近社区居民运动健身，对校园操场进行全面升级，傍晚放学后校园操场作为“田村社区运动场”，为周边10个社区的2万余名居民提供服务。广东省深圳市龙华区为解决居民体育设施土地资源不足的问题，通过新建改建都市型、楼宇型体育场地，推动全民健身设施更加便民。浙江省杭州市计划2022年新增群众身边体育健身设施300处，组织全民健身赛事活动和科学健身指导进社区（村）活动1万场，开放免费或低收费全民健身场地1万片。
回应群众“健身去哪儿”问题，关键要发挥政府的主导作用，在充分发挥各自优势的基础上，形成政府、市场、社会在全民健身服务供给中的协同关系。
在实现“带动3亿人参与冰雪运动”过程中，河北省提出了“全省3000万人参与冰雪运动”的目标，坚持政府主导、社会参与、市场运作，多渠道筹集资金22.02亿元。据河北省体育局局长张泽峰介绍，河北省在全国率先实现县县都有滑冰馆，室内滑冰馆202座，滑雪场馆62座，张家口市崇礼区已成为国内最大的高端和优质滑雪场聚集区。“今后我们将用好冬奥遗产，在上水平、扩规模、可持续上下功夫，深入推动群众性冰雪运动向纵深发展。”张泽峰说。
科学开展居家健身活动
群众体育工作要主动融入疫情防控大局
新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，居家健身、线上健身对居民保持身心健康、提高抵抗力起到积极作用，逐渐成为疫情防控常态化下群众参与健身的重要方式之一。国家体育总局副局长李建明说，群众体育工作要主动融入疫情防控大局，想群众所想，急群众所急，发挥“体育时时刻刻与老百姓在一起”的价值。
上海新国际博览中心方舱医院，患者在医生护士的带领下开展羽毛球、健步走、慢跑、健身气功等多种形式的锻炼活动。据统计，上海市已有4000多名社会体育指导员成为防疫志愿者，用自己的行动为社区服务。上海市体育局局长徐彬表示，当前上海疫情防控正处在最紧要的关键阶段，上海体育部门坚持做好体育服务，助力疫情防控。
《关于大力推广居家科学健身方法的通知》自印发以来，得到各地体育部门积极响应，社会广泛参与，满足了居民健身需求，倡导了健康生活方式。
今年一季度，北京市相关体育部门共举办近40项全民健身线上赛事活动，内容涉及棋牌、冰雪、骑行、模型、武术等众多项目；中国男子篮球职业联赛辽宁男篮俱乐部联合当地有关部门推出《居家抗疫健身指南》，球员张镇麟进行示范，完成热身、健身、放松拉伸等一整套训练；江苏省淮安市体育局等部门面向上班族、居家人员等社会大众，录制“动起来，增强您的抵抗力”为主题的科学健身系列视频，指导人民群众利用“一平方米的空间”进行有效锻炼。

让吴美琴感到庆幸的是，社区内党员迅速报到，一天汇聚300多名党员。两个小区都成立了临时党支部，筛选出13名党员组建党员突击队，各项工作迅速高效运转起来。
面对复杂严峻的疫情形势，吉林省全面落实省、市、区、街道、社区五级书记抓防控，有疫情防控任务的1452个城市社区全部选派了“第一书记”。省市县20余万名党员干部迅速下沉基层，在抗疫一线成立临时党组织7000余个，组建党员先锋队、突击队1.2万支。
在城镇，街道社区党组织充分发挥党建引领基层治理优势，扎紧扎实“街道、社区、网格、楼栋、单元”五级疫情防控防线。在乡村，9340名村党组织书记带领17.5万名农民党员、11.1万名志愿者，织起排查、防控、服务的大网。全省各级公立医院有1117个基层党组织参与疫情防控，在抗疫一线成立临时党支部196个；各国有企业、两新组织全力保供应，推动有序复工复产；全省高校建立临时党组织372个，凝心聚力坚决遏制校园疫情。
眼下正是长春市疫情防控最关键阶段，吉林省部分市州火速集结1.8万余名党员干部和医务工作者驰援。
吉林省还广泛招募志愿者参与抗疫，据“吉事办”小程序数据显示，目前全省注册志愿者人数超过60万，是疫情之前注册人数的两倍。
历经疫情大考，吉林各地基层党组织正变得更加坚强有力。

完善筛查措施，做好重点区域、重点人群防控
“奥密克戎变异株传播速度非常快，同时具有很高隐匿性，一旦发现感染者，往往呈现家庭聚集、单位聚集，并快速扩散。”上海市防控办疾控组副组长陈昕认为，“筛透、拔清、控住”是当前疫情防控的关键。应结合疫情流行水平、区域地理、人口特征等因素，动态优化“抗原+核酸”组合式筛查策略，提高发现感染者的时效性。
提升核酸检测筛查效率。中国疾控中心传染病所研究员卢珊建议，在采取现有核酸检测筛查策略的基础上，进一步突出重点。比如，本地医疗机构、疾控部门、第三方检测机构的精锐力量重点保障疫情较重的区域。对于城中村、大型企业和建筑工地等聚集疫情规模较大的点位，采用“2次抗原+1次核酸检测”策略，开展快速筛查。
“针对老旧小区、农村出租民宅等点位，各街道、乡镇要分类细化摸排，落实责任，加大管控力度。”上海市疫情防控工作领导小组专家组成员、复旦大学上海医学院副院长吴凡说，对每日感染人数持续高位或仍在上升的小区、企业等，组织专业力量深入分析封控以来每日新增感染人数持续增加的原因，包括感染者聚集特征、可能的传播途径、防控措施落实情况等。实行三区分类管理后，对疫情出现下降的区域，适当减少筛查频次，节约筛查力量；对疫情仍处于高位的区域，增加筛查力量，提高对阳性人员发现和转运的速度。
加强集中用工单位和城郊行政村疫情防控管理。上海市疾控中心党委书记袁政安认为，当前，上海市出现了集中用工单位、城郊行政村聚集性疫情增多的趋势。要压实集中用工单位主体责任，强化城郊行政村封控管理。
切实提高老年人新冠病毒疫苗接种率。目前上海市疫苗总体接种率很高，但60至69岁老人疫苗两针接种率为78%，70至79岁为61%，80岁以上仅为15%。北京大学公共卫生学院研究员刘珏认为，老年人群是奥密克戎变异株感染后重症、死亡的高风险人群。应加快老年人群疫苗接种工作力度，还要统筹老年感染者救治工作，在发现、转运、隔离、救治、健康监测等各环节予以优先，建立专门工作机制，尽可能减少重症、死亡。
盘活定点医院资源，对感染者进行分类救治
中国工程院院士、上海交大医学院附属瑞金医院院长宁光分析，奥密克戎变异株致病性较低，重型和危重型比例低，但病毒阳性合并基础疾病患者比例较高，而基础疾病可能出现加重甚至致死。他建议，对无症状感染者、轻症病例、基础疾病感染者、基础重症感染者和重症病例进行分类救治。对于定点医院来说，康复者应尽快出院、到社区进行居家健康观察，部分无基础疾病的病例可以转到方舱医院，以便盘活定点医院资源。
充分利用定点医院的优质医疗资源。宁光介绍，瑞金医院北部院区成立专家救治小组和专家咨询组，建立每天定期会诊制度。同时，将高年资和高水平医护力量派往一线，成立专科小组，以便更好治疗感染者的基础疾病。建议各定点医院充分利用自身优质医疗资源，开设专科病房，提升收治能力。定点医院的平台学科也要充分开放，例如麻醉、血库、检验科、药房等。此外，尽快恢复对ICU重症、血透、妊娠等特殊需求感染者的救治。
提升重症患者救治能力。宁光认为，未来可能会有更多重症患者需入住重症监护室，因此有必要增加定点医院重症监护室床位数量，并适当将非定点医院的重症监护室有序开放。同时，增加重症监护室医生和护士数量，加强培训和指导。此外，建立重症患者筛查制度，对风险人群及早监测，一旦转重，立即转入重症监护室进行专业化评估、诊断和治疗。
加强隔离病房和方舱医院的救治力量。宁光建议，专家应深入临床一线，进入隔离病房，对疑难复杂的病例进行查房、会诊。隔离病房和方舱医院要配备心理医生、临床药师和中医师，建立医疗、护理、院感、保障和行政每日联合交班制度，制定每日清单制度，提高救治效率。
“医疗机构要维持最低且必需的群众看病需求，但应该避免感染者带来的院内感染。”宁光说，医疗机构必须严格执行分区管理，门诊、急诊、住院部各自分开，独立运行；每栋楼宇相对独立，人员不流动；每个病区相对封闭，减少不必要流动；公共平台区域相对独立。

一段时间以来，英国新冠肺炎疫情持续反弹，住院患者激增，医护人员严重短缺，医疗系统面临巨大压力。高感染率还给教育、航空等众多行业带来巨大冲击。超过2000名英国科学界人士日前紧急发表联名公开信，批评“与新冠病毒共存”计划让脆弱群体处于危险之中。
今年2月下旬，英国政府宣布实施“与新冠病毒共存”计划，取消了新冠肺炎确诊患者需自我隔离等规定，不再为民众提供免费检测服务，将“政府防控转向个人责任”。一系列防疫措施的取消导致疫情猛烈反弹，住院人数和死亡病例激增，多地医院宣布进入“严重危机状态”。与此同时，具有“新冠肺炎长期症状”的人数达到170万。
“大量住院病例将持续，死亡病例将不断增加”
英国国家统计局最新公布的数据显示，截至4月2日的一周内，英国有近490万人感染新冠病毒，感染人数持续保持高位。其中英格兰地区每13人中就有1人感染新冠病毒，创有记录以来最高水平。
据统计，3月21日至27日的一周中，英国新冠肺炎导致的日均住院人数为2115人，是一个月前的两倍多。同一周，全国报告988例新冠肺炎死亡病例，比前一周增加36%。根据第三方机构全球变化数据实验室最新统计数据，按人口规模计算，英国新冠肺炎死亡率比欧盟国家平均死亡率高5.4%。
英国政府紧急情况科学咨询小组成员、伦敦大学卫生和热带医学院教授约翰·埃德蒙兹接受《卫报》采访时表示，英国此轮疫情形势恶化，除奥密克戎变异毒株BA.2亚型传播速度更快外，取消自我隔离等防控措施、民众社交活动增加、戴口罩等自我防护措施减少等都是重要因素。预计感染人数在未来几个月将继续走高，“大量住院病例将持续，死亡病例将不断增加”。
英国国家统计局高级统计学家卡拉·斯蒂尔指出，疫情在英国仍处于高位流行阶段，英格兰和威尔士地区的感染率创新高，老年群体的感染率显著上升。
感染人数持续攀升，引发民众对病毒变异的担忧。英国卫生安全局的监测数据显示，截至4月5日，英国已报告1125例感染新冠病毒XE毒株的病例。该毒株为奥密克戎BA.1和BA.2亚型的重组毒株，传播速度比BA.2亚型增加21%。
英国政府首席科学顾问帕特里克·瓦兰斯表示，疫情远没有结束，新冠病毒进化还有“很多空间”，它可能在未来几年内继续快速进化，而且“不能保证下一个变异毒株的危险性会降低”。
英国知名传染病免疫学家、帝国理工学院教授丹尼·奥尔特曼认为，就现阶段而言，新冠病毒仍然是一种无法忍受的“猖獗”病毒，会导致反复感染，导致人们无法上学、上班，导致大量死亡。
英国卫生安全局负责人哈里斯称，未来18个月至两年，新冠肺炎疫情走向仍难以预测，这是一个广泛共识。
“感染新冠病毒可能出现的长期症状持续给医疗系统带来压力”
“与新冠病毒共存”计划让英国医疗系统面临巨大压力。住院患者激增，医护人员严重短缺，医疗机构不堪重负。目前，全国医院床位占用率达94%。因感染新冠病毒而缺勤的医护人员大幅增加，日均缺勤2.85万人。
英国《每日电讯报》报道，英国多地医院宣布进入“严重危机状态”。英格兰地区有6家医疗机构表示，急诊等候时间一般长达12小时，“除非发生严重事故或者生命垂危”，否则不建议患者前来就诊。
新一波疫情加剧了对医疗资源的挤兑，英国国民健康服务体系（NHS）的等待手术人数创下新纪录，医疗人员持续紧缺。非紧急情况等候治疗的患者达600万人，据预测，该数字到2024年将增加至1400万。一项最新调查显示，英国民众对NHS医疗服务的满意度只有36%，降至25年来的最低点，比2019年下降30个百分点。
伦敦大学国王学院儿科传染病专家麦克德莫特表示：“感染新冠病毒可能出现的长期症状持续给医疗系统带来压力。大量新冠肺炎患者愈后工作能力受限，影响收入，将增加医疗和财政支出，进一步影响经济。”《金融时报》援引英国国家统计局一项研究指出，目前英国有“新冠肺炎长期症状”的人数达到170万。其中，2/3的人日常生活受到影响，1/5的人日常活动能力受到严重限制。
《英国医学杂志》日前发表的一项研究指出，患者感染新冠病毒30天内发生肺栓塞的风险增加33倍，出现深静脉血栓的风险增加5倍，出血风险增加两倍。研究指出，即便是新冠肺炎轻症患者，出现深静脉血栓和肺栓塞的风险也会小幅增加。
“减弱英国应对未来新一波疫情的能力”
高感染率对英国经济社会运行造成严重影响。英国教育部最新数据显示，3月31日，英国公立中小学缺课人数达到17.9万人，是一个月前的1.7倍。同日，每11名教师中大约有1名老师因感染新冠肺炎而缺勤，有20%的公立中小学教师缺勤比例超过15%。英国学校与学院负责人协会秘书长巴顿表示，学校师生感染人数将继续增加，教学活动将继续受到影响，政府教育部门的应对措施“混乱不堪”。
英国小企业联合会称，目前1/7的企业因疫情无法正常运营。据《泰晤士报》报道，因员工感染人数增加，英国多家航空公司纷纷取消航班。4月7日，易捷航空取消了72个班次，英国航空取消了50个班次。易捷航空表示，员工缺勤率是平时的两倍。
英国国内对“与新冠病毒共存”计划的批评声音不断升高。日前，超过2000名英国科学界人士紧急发表联名公开信表示：“我们不相信这一政策基于坚实的科学依据，该政策会导致新的变异毒株很难被发现。”英国医师协会理事会主席钱德·纳格保罗认为：“英国政府的政策使脆弱群体处于危险之中。”英国政府首席医疗顾问克里斯·惠蒂警告，当前英国疫情不容乐观，过早的解封令人担忧。
英国巴斯大学数理生物学家基特·耶茨表示，大范围免费检测停止后，很多民众负担不起每周检测的费用，因此会选择不检测，“政府强调的‘个人责任’无从谈起”。利兹大学医学院病毒学专家斯蒂芬·格里芬表示：“‘与新冠病毒共存’将减弱英国应对未来新一波疫情的能力。疫情造成的损失，远高于削减检测项目省下的钱，不能只看眼前。”
奥尔特曼表示：“‘与新冠病毒共存’就像政策办公室的公关行话，与现代医学格格不入。我们从不会告诉人们，他们只需要学会与艾滋病病毒、肺结核或疟疾共存。”他强调，希望看到英国和欧洲“回归更务实、以数据为主导”的抗疫政策。“你不能通过忽略病毒来假装它不存在”。
英国医学专家警告称，对新冠肺炎疫情的认识存在误区，奥密克戎毒株变得温和可能只是变异过程中的“一个意外”，不排除下一个新冠毒株毒性可能更强；英国疫苗接种率虽高，但新冠病毒也在不断变异，无法预测，充满不确定性。英国雷丁大学微生物学家西蒙·克拉克说：“认为新冠病毒必然会越来越弱是一厢情愿。不幸的是，在英国和世界其他一些地区，有一部分人一直试图淡化这场疫情的严重性。”

583,美国人均预期寿命连续两年下降,李志伟;,17,4/14/22,71,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWa18T3lV7BSVIom52w4Zlnz67QEKDo8ic8qBCm03ntraGF-e_8JP_lZGfiwbflcbnhOm-B3zLewsqiGTuX7cuWKDjIh9CSiBKAhVlVcAwNa62OYYl1SCIx&uniplatform=NZKPT,"近日，美国一份研究报告指出，由于新冠肺炎疫情肆虐，美国人均预期寿命过去两年连续下降。该研究报告第一作者、科罗拉多大学社会学家瑞安·马斯特斯认为，包括不平等加剧、系统性种族主义以及经济无保障等社会因素，导致美国人均预期寿命疫情期间急剧下降。
这份研究报告由科罗拉多州、弗吉尼亚州和华盛顿特区的公共卫生专家撰写。报告显示，2019年美国人均预期寿命为78.86岁，2020年这一数据急剧下降至76.99岁，2021年继续下降至76.6岁。“这些都是历史上罕见的下降”。
报告通过横向比较发现，在统计的20个富裕国家中，过去两年美国人均预期寿命下降幅度最大。其他19个富裕国家人均预期寿命在2020年略有下降之后，在2021年均有所增长。美国是唯一一个连续两年均出现下降的国家。报告作者之一、美国城市研究所高级研究员劳丹·阿伦说：“美国与其他同等收入国家之间的预期寿命差距现在超过了5岁，这令人难以置信。”
分析指出，这一研究凸显了美国应对疫情方面的诸多问题。《时代》周刊网站报道称，疫情期间，无法得到医疗救治的问题在美国医疗机构普遍存在：急救室人满为患；救护车找不到可以实施急救的重症监护室；医护人员极度短缺；医院为应对新冠肺炎患者激增被迫推迟其他非紧急手术。美国有线电视新闻网援引专家的话说，这是美国应对疫情不力带来的后果。
因医疗卫生体系中的种族不平等，美国少数族裔在疫情初期受影响最为严重。报告显示，2020年美国非洲裔、拉美裔的预期寿命分别下降了3.22岁和3.7岁，而白人预期寿命则下降1.38岁。《华盛顿邮报》指出，2020年美国拉美裔、非洲裔民众预期寿命降幅超过了二战期间的历史性降幅。少数族裔预期寿命下降幅度比白人要明显得多，反映出新冠病毒“对有色人种造成的不呈比例的影响”。
报告还显示，2021年预期寿命下降主要体现在美国白人群体。该报告的作者分析说，在白人人口比例高的一些州，人们对疫苗的排斥态度、反防疫措施行为，可能是这一形势逆转的一个原因。
《华盛顿邮报》指出，美国人均预期寿命趋势是社会、经济、医疗和政治等多重因素共同作用的结果。过去10年，一个明显的因素是毒品过量危机，这主要是由于阿片类药物泛滥造成的，这影响了美国人的预期寿命。
当前，美国国内政治极化现象日趋严重，导致防疫被政治化，部分政客屡屡发表反科学、反常识言论，大量民众被虚假信息误导。美国耶鲁大学公共卫生学院流行病学家格雷格·贡萨尔维斯说，美国不顾一切地想将疫情抛诸脑后，“这促使我们决定放弃个人和社区层面的基本防护，将我们所有人都置于危险的境地”。美国普林斯顿大学人口统计学家诺琳·戈德曼表示，美国人均预期寿命下降的数据让她“感到难以置信，美国在这场疫情中表现得十分糟糕”。

疫情防控不松劲，春耕备播不误时。辽宁各地党委、政府抢抓天气晴好、气温回暖的有利时机，在做好疫情防控的同时，全力保障春耕生产。
位于铁岭市郊的新台子火车站是辽北地区农资的主要集散站，在这里，刚运抵的化肥、种子等被有序装载到前往各县区的货车上。“我们制定了春耕重点物资运输保障方案，优先受理、装车、挂运、卸车，开辟绿色通道，随到随装。”沈阳车务段新台子站站长孙冬红说。
辽宁省农业农村厅下发通知，要求各地保障运输春耕物资、运送返乡农民工的车辆以及跨区作业农机具通行。
在阜新蒙古族自治县，得益于县里开通的农资进村绿色通道，务欢池镇永先村村民程龙驾驶货车顺利通过各个疫情防控点，并将化肥种子送到村民家里。村党支部书记陈子明介绍，本轮疫情以来，村里号召村民线上购买农资，互帮互助，不误农时，也保证了防疫安全。
辽宁省农业农村厅还成立农资保供专班，设立热线电话，优化行政审批服务，对涉及春耕农资事项开通绿色通道，优先办理、加急办理；发改、工信等部门落实化肥临时储备任务，做好生产企业用电和原材料保障。据统计，今年辽宁省春耕农资总需求量317万吨，截至目前已备实九成。
“我们在确保农民做好个人防护的前提下，实施错时下田、错峰劳作，并在各个乡镇、村屯设立专人包保责任制，对不能回乡种田的村民，协调各合作社和涉农组织，开展联耕联种、代耕代种等服务，做到不耽误农时，不出现撂荒。”北票市农业农村局局长李玉泉说。
“今年这种天气，玉米最适宜的播种时间是哪几天？”“今年有没有好的水稻品种推荐……”在辽宁省农科院组织的一次春耕备播公益直播中，农业专家耐心细致地回答农户提出的问题。两个多小时的直播，有12万余人次观看，点赞量超过30万。“今年尽管受疫情影响，但对农户们的指导不能减少。”辽宁省农科院科技服务部部长尤文忠说。
截至目前，辽宁已完成机耕整地582.7万亩，播种农作物106.7万亩；全省投入农机具12.9万台（套），指导检修各类农机具超过48万台（套），培训农民、农机手、农机合作社人员等超过3.9万人次。

近期，我国新增本土确诊病例和无症状感染者增长快速，呈现点多、面广、频发的特点，个别地区疫情仍处于高位运行。为了尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延势头，社会各界统一思想、凝聚共识，坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，各行各业人员坚守岗位、辛勤工作，做实做细各项疫情防控措施。
坚持“动态清零”是上海抗疫最佳方案
当前，上海疫情防控正处在最紧要的关键阶段，坚持“动态清零”总方针是最佳选择，也是最佳方案。
“上海是老龄化程度非常高的城市，一旦‘躺平’，很有可能造成老年人和其他脆弱人群重症和死亡，无法承受。”上海市疾病预防控制中心副主任吴寰宇说，上海本轮疫情流行的毒株主要是奥密克戎BA.2，传播速度非常快，隐匿性特别强，也就是无症状感染者和轻症病例占比非常高，大大增加了疫情防控的难度。奥密克戎变异株绝不是“大号流感”，危害性不能低估。放眼“躺平”的国家和地区，老年人和其他脆弱人群的病死率都比预想的要高很多。
“我所在的辖区属于老城区，老年人多、外来人员多，人员密集程度高。”上海市公安局黄浦分局南京东路派出所所长吴春晖介绍，辖区里有大量老式居民楼，不少煤气和卫生设施都是共用的，存在交叉感染风险；加之老年群体的抵抗力更弱，只有快速遏制疫情蔓延，才能更好地保护他们。面对复杂严峻的疫情形势，南京东路派出所民警全员出动，在封闭集中管理的条件下，配合小区做好管控措施，维持秩序。
上海市民正在为早日实现“动态清零”积极出力。“作为居民，我们要做好自己能做的事情，积极参与社区疫情防控。”杨浦区新江湾城街道居民赵志超说，有的邻居是医生，战斗在抗疫第一线；有的主动报名成为志愿者，连夜帮助转运物资；有的协助社区居委会，引导居民做好核酸检测等工作……
我国具备实现“动态清零”的能力
常态化疫情防控以来，我国坚持“人民至上、生命至上”抗疫理念，坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针，快速有效处置数十起局部地区聚集性疫情，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康，我国经济发展和疫情防控保持全球领先地位。
“我国积极应对疫情，努力实现‘动态清零’，是为了更好地保护人民生命安全和身体健康。”广西民族大学校长谢尚果说，我国是人口大国，哪怕是低病亡率，乘以14亿多的人口基数，绝对数都很大。奥密克戎变异株具有极强的传播力，如果放弃“动态清零”总方针，人民生命安全和健康将会受到巨大威胁，经济社会发展将遭到巨大打击。我国始终坚持“人民至上、生命至上”抗疫理念，将人民群众生命安全和身体健康放在第一位。两年多来，我国充分发挥中国共产党的领导和社会主义集中力量办大事的制度优势，顶住了一轮又一轮疫情的冲击。事实证明，我国具备实现“动态清零”的能力，能够实现以最小社会成本获得最大防控成效。
“我国实现社会面‘动态清零’，是可以做到的。”吴寰宇分析，虽然奥密克戎变异株传播快，但只要做到早发现、早管控、早治疗，切断传播途径，保护好易感人群，仍然能够及时有效控制疫情。我国抗疫的“武器”也在不断丰富：大规模核酸检测和抗原检测技术和能力不断提升，新冠病毒疫苗接种在快速推进。
北京首都国际机场股份有限公司运行控制中心副总经理李洋说，作为重要的口岸枢纽，北京首都国际机场对于入境的航空器、旅客、机组、行李、货物等，以及所有参与入境航班保障的工作人员和物品全部实施闭环管理，同时根据疫情形势，动态调整进京航班的防疫措施。“只有实现‘动态清零’，快速有力控制住疫情，才能保持经济社会正常运行，才能保障群众的安全出行需求。”
努力用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果
上海财经大学教授吴一平认为，“动态清零”总方针综合考虑了我国庞大的人口基数以及老年人占比高等国情，也是现阶段基于疫情形势的最佳选择。应构建全链条防治体系，当出现疫情时，能及时识别、快速处置、遏制规模反弹。比如，基层政府和社区做好防疫宣传工作，让群众及时准确获得所在地区的疫情信息；城市封闭管理期，创新运用政企协作的物资供应模式，保障群众基本生活；开展心理疏导，增强群众抗击疫情的决心和信心等。
“尽管目前疫情形势严峻、复杂，但对于每一名阳性感染者，疾控部门仍然毫不松懈地在最短时间里完成流调工作。”吴寰宇说，上海市疾控部门结合疫情传播的新特点，通过了解每个阳性感染者的发现方式、疫苗接种情况、密接人员等关键信息，迅速分析研判疫情特点、态势、风险点，并提出针对性的防控措施建议，为实现“动态清零”打好基础。
“我们现在做的事就是帮助上海尽快实现‘动态清零’。”浙江省援沪方舱医院医疗队医疗副院长陈亚岗介绍，他所在的医疗队在上海临港方舱医院负责约5600个床位的管理和治疗。他认为，相比居家，方舱医院具备更好的隔离环境，是控制传染源、切断传播途径的有效手段，还可以为感染者提供必要的医疗支持。
“我们严格按照疫情防控部门要求，落实落细车站和列车疫情防控一系列措施。”杭州火车东站站长施正威表示，车站认真执行测温、验码等工作，全面加强公共场所消毒，并暂时关闭换乘通道，帮助阻断疫情传播链条；同时，车站强化职工防疫管理，督促职工严守少流动、不聚集等要求，压实单位和个人防疫责任，并完善相关应急预案，从严从紧守住铁路防疫关口。
封控地区的群众相互鼓励、相互帮助，为遏制疫情蔓延打下了坚实基础。“没有葱姜蒜，就有好心邻居拿出来；自己储备的大米白面、生活用纸，只要有人需要，立刻拿出来分享；如果需要志愿者，微信群里一呼百应……”封控期间，邻里之间的帮助，让赵志超非常感动，“相信通过大家的努力，一定能够实现‘动态清零’，尽快解封，让孩子们早点下楼感受春天!”

3月1日至4月11日，31个省区市和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告本土感染者325303例，波及30个省区市。国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长、一级巡视员雷正龙表示，随着各地疫情防控措施的落实落地，新发生疫情的地区能够快速有效处置，没有形成新的规模性疫情。河北、江苏、安徽、广东、福建、浙江、山东等省疫情总体可控。吉林省疫情总体呈下降趋势，但仍在高位；长春市每天新增感染者人数下降，但管控区内社区传播没有完全阻断，仍需要继续加强管控区内各项防控工作。上海市连续8天报告新增感染者数超过1万例，疫情处于快速上升期，社区传播尚没有得到有效遏制，且外溢多省份，预计未来几日新增感染者人数仍将处于高位。
国家发展改革委经济运行调节局副局长许正斌表示，近期部分地区发生疫情以来，国家发改委全面启动生活物资保障相关工作机制，重点工作包括：加强监测调度，建立疫情重点地区生活物资日报制度，跟踪政府储备和商业库存、市场供应、价格波动等情况，及时发现苗头性问题并采取针对性举措。建立全覆盖的分省包片协调机制，加强与包干省区市的衔接，及时了解生活物资保障情况和困难并帮助协调解决。同时，积极督促协调、抓好产销衔接、强化重点保障。
“总体上看，近一段时期，全国重要民生商品供给充裕、价格基本稳定，粮油价格保持平稳，猪肉价格持续低位运行，牛羊肉和鸡肉价格较为稳定，鸡蛋价格稳中略升。”许正斌说，但也要看到，3月中旬以来，蔬菜价格受疫情多发导致物流受阻、成本上升等影响，出现明显上涨，特别是上海、长春等地涨幅较大，近日随着各地保供稳价措施的落实，价格开始逐步回落。
商务部消费促进司副司长李党会说，针对疫情防控重点地区，商务部均已启动“多方帮一方”的联保联供机制，及时调动周边省份、生活物资外延基地省份市场资源和保供力量，维护好重点地区的正常运转。截至4月11日，内蒙古、浙江、福建、江西、山东、河南、湖北、四川、广西、云南、宁夏等省份已累计向上海供应蔬菜1.8万吨、米面850吨、肉蛋500吨，另外还无偿支援了蔬菜、水果、牛奶、面包、罐头等食品5400多吨。
李党会介绍，对于一些地区货运车辆通行、配送仓储“一刀切”管控，导致跨区域运力下降、保供受到影响等一系列问题，商务部积极发挥部门联动作用，配合有关部门研提措施。针对部分城市出现的“最后一公里”“最后一百米”物流不畅、配送不到的问题，在总结有关防控封闭管理区保供经验的基础上，及时复制推广辽宁等地的抗疫保供新经验、新做法，有效提高生活必需品入户的效率。
当前，我国轻型病例和无症状感染者比例高。有观点认为，集中隔离有造成医疗资源挤兑的风险，建议居家隔离，但也有人认为，无症状感染者居家隔离会存在很大的社会面传播隐患。中国疾控中心流行病学首席专家吴尊友解释，无症状感染者中有一部分人很可能处于确诊病例的潜伏期，再观察一段时间后会出现症状，甚至发展成重症。居家隔离存在风险，一是有可能继续造成疫情传播扩散，二是如果不能及时发现病情进展，可能错过最佳的治疗时期，可能发展成重症甚至对生命构成威胁。如果出现轻症和无症状感染者，要尽可能把这些人集中到定点隔离点进行隔离观察。
部分感染者目前来不及或者暂未转运至隔离点治疗，应该如何做好防疫工作？吴尊友表示，首先要做到减少家庭内传播，感染者应该单独居住一个卧室，最好有一个独立的卫生间，不和家人共同进餐。第二，减少传染给邻居或其他小区居民的风险。感染者家庭要及时对居室、卫生间等环境进行消毒，感染者家庭成员不能抱着侥幸心理去串门。封控管理和健康监测期间，每位居民都要注意观察自己的身体状况变化，有没有出现咽喉痒、咽喉疼痛、咳嗽、发热等症状，通过抗原检测方法进行自我检测。如果出现疑似症状或者抗原检测筛查阳性，要及时与当地防疫部门联系。
截至4月11日，全国累计报告接种新冠病毒疫苗33亿32.8万剂次，完成全程接种的人数为12亿4492.3万人。60岁以上老年人接种覆盖人数达2亿2477.7万人。中国疾控中心免疫规划首席专家王华庆表示，接种新冠病毒疫苗对预防新冠病毒、包括对预防奥密克戎毒株导致的重症和死亡有非常好的效果。呼吁符合条件的老年人尽快接种疫苗，尽快全程接种疫苗，符合条件时尽快进行加强接种。

应该看到，对凶猛疫情采取严格防控措施，难免会对经济社会发展、人民生产生活造成一定的暂时影响。确定抗击疫情最佳方案，关键在于如何用更小成本在更短时间内控制住疫情，减少疫情带来的不利影响，以良好的防控成效保障经济社会持续健康稳定发展。
我国坚持“动态清零”，是落实“人民至上、生命至上”理念的基本要求。从病毒特点来看，奥密克戎变异株具有传播速度快、隐性感染和轻症病例比例高等特点，更容易造成大范围的传播。如不及时从严防控，势必令易感人群感染风险加大，最终将形成规模性反弹，进而引发群众恐慌，造成医疗资源挤兑，让正常的就医需求无法得到保证。从我国国情来看，60岁及以上人口达2.67亿。数据显示，还有超5000万老人未完成新冠疫苗全程接种。奥密克戎变异株本身的致病性虽然不及其他毒株强，但绝不是“大号流感”，对高龄患者、合并严重基础病患者等特殊人群具有潜在严重威胁。可以说，“动态清零”是由我国基本国情决定的，是由我国始终坚持的“人民至上、生命至上”理念决定的。
推进疫情防控，要算眼前账，更要算长远账。短期来看，因为疫情防控，一个地方经济社会、群众生活确实会受到影响，但从一个国家、一个整体来看，防止疫情扩散，换来的是更大范围、更广泛的百姓正常生产生活，是更加宽松、稳定的经济社会发展环境。经济社会正常动态循环的恢复以疫情的有效防控为前提，疫情越早得到控制，经济社会发展受到的影响就越小。相反，如果错失抗疫的最佳时机，导致疫情传播面扩大，付出的代价会更高，对经济社会和人民健康造成的损失会更大。“动态清零”较好地平衡了疫情防控和经济社会发展之间的关系，能够让我们用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响。也正因此，我们必须坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，从严从实把防控措施落实到每一个环节。
实践是最有力的说服。2021年，德尔塔变异株带来的疫情一度波及20余个省份，我国坚持“动态清零”总方针，迅速采取防控措施，迎战德尔塔变异株，有效处置30余起聚集性疫情，基本用一个潜伏期（14天）就控制住疫情。这也充分说明，“动态清零”是符合我国国情、符合科学的，是我国当前抗击疫情的最佳选择，力争在短时间内做到“动态清零”是最经济、最有效的疫情防控策略。
当前，上海市各项疫情防控措施正在发挥作用，上海有基础、有条件、有能力实现“动态清零”。虽然上海市报告的感染者数量处于高位，但按照奥密克戎变异株流行的指数型增长的参数来看，没有出现指数型上升态势，表明采取的防控措施遏制住了指数型上升的势头。处在这样一个关键时期和胶着状态，必须牢牢抓住这个时间窗口，以快制快，尽快阻断社会面传播，共同战胜疫情。坚持“动态清零”总方针不动摇，从严从紧、从细从实抓好疫情防控各项工作不松劲，坚定信心、连续奋战，我们相信，上海一定能战胜眼前的困难，打赢这场疫情防控攻坚战。

埃及——
电子钱包成多数人付款和转账首选
马赫迪·萨威在埃及首都开罗一家电脑城工作。工作间隙，他通过软件Fawry缴纳了当月的水电费、燃气费和电话费等。“即便用户没有银行账户或信用卡，依靠Fawry，也可以通过电子钱包、自动取款机、零售店等其他服务网点支付各类账单。”萨威坦言，自己已经很久没有与现金打交道了。
Fawry是一家总部位于开罗的金融科技公司，创设了埃及首个也是规模最大的电子账单支付平台，目前为全国500多座城镇、15万个服务网点提供250多种电子支付服务。据介绍，Fawry拥有数千万用户，每日处理超过210万笔交易，日交易额达25亿美元。
埃及银行研究所的一项调查结果显示，疫情防控期间，埃及现金交易数额减少了85%，数字支付和货到付款数额跃升了690%，并且90%的用户表示对电子支付有信心。开罗大学金融与投资学教授赫沙姆·易卜拉欣在接受本报记者采访时表示：“电子钱包已成为多数埃及人付款和转账的首要选择，因为它比其他支付方式更便捷，而且减少了货币印刷和回收的负担。”
埃及“2030愿景”把大力发展数字支付和电子金融作为重要部分。目前，埃及的数字支付技术部门包括39家银行、39家保险公司、900家小额融资金融公司和民间社会组织、44家移动电话网络运营商和50家电子支付公司等。“这为埃及的数字支付提供了强有力的支持和提升空间，埃及的电子金融和无纸化经济必将得到更加蓬勃的发展。”易卜拉欣说。
新加坡——
数字支付从便利选择变为基本服务
网上购物、打车、订外卖……29岁的阿扎里来自新加坡，电子支付已成为他日常生活的一部分。“在疫情防控期间，这种方式既安全卫生，又快捷便利。”阿扎里说，使用电子支付还能获得奖励积分或现金回扣。
据统计，2021年前10个月，新加坡跨银行转账服务系统PayNow交易量达1.85亿笔，较去年同期的1.09亿笔大幅增长。从2019年到2020年，PayNow的交易量和交易额都翻了一番。新加坡目前约75%的商家都在使用通用二维码作为支付方式。
为推动电子支付的广泛应用和发展，新加坡金融管理局专门成立了支付委员会，成员包括银行、支付服务提供商、企业协会等，以共同促进行业创新合作。2018年，新加坡政府推出全国共用付款二维码“SGQR”，支持多种支付模式。消费者无论使用哪种手机支付应用，都能扫描同一个QR码付款。
为了保障消费者权益，新加坡政府于2019年通过了付款服务法令，对新加坡的支付服务提供商进行监管。政府还通过多项计划，安排数码大使、商业顾问等，在小商贩、老年人等群体中间推广数字支付，帮助他们适应数字社会。
谷歌、淡马锡和贝恩公司联合发布的《2021年东南亚数字经济报告》显示，2021年新加坡电子商务同比增加45%，商品交易总额达71亿美元。新加坡大华银行个人金融服务部主管杰奎琳表示，数字支付正从一种便利的选择变为一种基本的服务。
巴西——
推动更多消费者接触数字支付
近年来，巴西选择无现金支付的消费者正在逐渐增加。数据显示，2020年，巴西现金交易的比例为35%，相比前一年的47%有不小的降幅。
在巴西推动无现金支付的过程中，巴西中央银行于2020年11月推出的实时电子支付系统PIX发挥了重要作用。依托个人银行账户，巴西用户在PIX系统中可以把纳税人识别号、手机号或者电子邮箱设为用户名，之后就可以方便即时地进行电子钱包之间的转账和付款。巴西央行行长罗伯托·坎波斯·内托表示：“支付方式正发生巨大的变化。社会需要快速、低成本、安全、透明和开放的产品。”
如今，在巴西的商店、餐馆、出租车等消费场景，PIX支付方式随处可见。根据巴西央行数据，PIX正式推出一年来，用户超过1.1亿，完成交易16亿笔，已超过银行账单、银行转账、支票等支付方式交易总和，成为巴西人的主要支付方式之一。据悉，巴西央行还打算为PIX用户提供国际交易选项。
巴西数字银行业也得到迅速发展。去年12月，拉美地区金融科技独角兽、巴西数字银行Nubank在纽约证券交易所上市。这家成立于2013年的公司，基于机器学习和人工智能技术，开展数字银行账户、虚拟信用卡以及个性化个人信贷等业务。顾客使用手机应用便可以进行冻结信用卡、额度调整等操作，且无需缴纳管理费、工本费。2021年前9个月，Nubank实现10.6亿美元营收，较2020年几乎翻了一番，目前注册用户数量达到4800万。
独立支付业务运营商Worldpay拉美区域经理胡安表示，从销售到支付，数字化趋势已经不可逆转。“疫情加速了这个早已开始的过程，推动更多消费者开始接触数字支付方式。当消费者体验到数字支付的安全和便捷，他们就很难回到以前依赖现金的状态。”

3月以来，吉林省疫情防控形势严峻，部分企业生产效率受到影响。
贯彻落实习近平总书记关于疫情防控工作的重要指示精神，吉林省坚持疫情防控和稳运行“两手抓”，紧盯抓牢重点企业的疫情防控和稳定生产，切实帮助企业解决实际问题，尽力降低疫情对经济和民生的影响。
吉林省成立由常务副省长任组长的稳运行组和物资保障组，吉林省工信厅组建专班，全力保障企业防疫情、稳运行、早复工。逐户调度全省14户百亿级产值企业、50户重点大型企业，组织各地区调度500户重点企业，全面了解涉疫人员管控和生产情况。
“现在我们两班倒，全力投入生产。”在位于长春市九台区的吉林中财管道有限公司，相关负责人介绍，“同时为做好疫情防控，员工们定期做抗原检测，每隔几天做一次全员核酸采样。”
“针对各家企业的不同情况，我们推行‘一企一策’，帮助解决员工返厂、物资运输、疫情防控等方面出现的困难，使企业尽快有序复工复产。”九台经济开发区党工委书记、管委会主任祖东航表示，在做好疫情防控措施的前提下，将推进具备条件的各类工业企业应复尽复。
吉林省制定全省工业企业有序复工复产方案，坚持问题导向，着力解决原材料供应不足、运输受阻等问题。积极对接工信部，协调解决部分企业跨省运输受阻问题；横向协调省交通厅、公安厅，将汽车及零部件、石化、冶金建材等重点工业原辅料、产成品等纳入优先通行保障范围；加强省市协同，及时调度对接企业需求，为重点企业提供口罩、防护服等物资支持；对吉林四大发电公司22家热电联产企业的电煤进耗存情况进行日调度，推进落实“五路并进”电煤保供措施。
“我们将继续推进落实助企惠企的各项政策措施，全力支持复工复产，提振市场主体信心。”吉林省商务厅副厅长吕继伟说。

通知深入贯彻落实党中央、国务院决策部署，要求各地区、各部门全力保障货运物流特别是医疗防控物资、生活必需品、政府储备物资、邮政快递等民生物资和农业、能源、原材料等重要生产物资的运输畅通，切实维护人民群众正常生产生活秩序。
一要全力畅通交通运输通道。各地区和有关部门要迅速启动部省站三级调度、路警联动、区域协调的保通保畅工作机制，确保交通主干线畅通。严禁擅自阻断或关闭高速公路、普通公路、航道船闸，严禁在高速公路主线和服务区设置防疫检查点，高速公路防疫检查点应设在收费站外广场及以外区域，具备条件的地方要配套设置充足的货车专用通道、休息区，不得擅自关停高速公路服务区、港口码头、铁路车站和航空机场，确需关停的，要按规定报批。
二要优化防疫通行管控措施。因疫情需对地级城市市辖区和县域、地市级及以上城市实施全域封闭管理的，防疫通行管控措施分别由地市级、省级联防联控机制批准并公布。不得随意限制货运车辆和司乘人员通行，不得以车籍地、户籍地作为限制通行条件，不得简单以货车司乘人员、船员通信行程卡绿色带*号为由限制车辆船舶的通行、停靠。
三要全力组织应急物资中转。疫情严重地区要依托周边物流园区（枢纽场站、快递园区）、高速公路服务区等，加快设立启用物资中转调运站、接驳点或分拨场地，并及时向社会公告；对需跨省域设立的，相邻省份要给予支持。对进出全域封闭城市内物资中转站点的货车司乘人员，在严格落实闭环管理措施、24小时内核酸检测阴性情况下，实行通信行程卡“白名单”管理模式。
四要切实保障重点物资和邮政快递通行。涉疫地区所在省份的省级联防联控机制应根据本地疫情防控形势和重点物资运输需求，建立健全重点物资运输车辆通行证制度，实行网上办理，全国互认。要充分发挥区域统筹协调机制作用，加快推进京津冀、长三角、珠三角、东北三省、成渝等重点区域货运物流保通保畅协同联动。要确保涉疫地区港口码头、铁路车站、航空机场的集疏运畅通。要将邮政、快递作为民生重点，切实保障邮政、快递车辆通行。
五要加强从业人员服务保障。原则上防疫检查点都应就近配套设置充足的核酸检测点，在车流量较大的高速公路服务区加密设置核酸检测点。鼓励有条件的地区为货车司机、船员提供免费核酸检测服务。切实做好因疫情滞留的货车司乘人员、船员的餐饮、如厕等基本生活服务。
各地区、各部门要着力纾困解难，全面落实对交通运输企业和个体工商户的扶持政策，关心关爱货车司机、快递员群体。要加强值班值守，精准落实疫情防控举措，对与本通知要求不符的防疫通行管控措施要立即整改。国务院有关部门要加大督导检查力度，对疫情防控措施层层加码、简单实行“一刀切”劝返、违规设置防疫检查点、擅自阻断运输通道的，要督促加快整改。对于严重影响货运物流畅通、造成物资供应短缺或中断的，要依法依规严肃追究有关地方、单位和人员的责任。

当前，上海每日报告的感染者数量仍在高位，疫情形势仍然严峻复杂，疫情防控正处在最紧要的关键阶段。越是在这个时候，越要充分认识到，“动态清零”是上海抗疫最佳方案。一方面，上海本轮疫情流行的毒株主要是奥密克戎BA.2，绝非“大号流感”。与流感相比，奥密克戎变异株传播速度更快，传播的隐匿性更强，更容易造成大范围的传播，致病性也比流感大。如果在坚持“动态清零”总方针上有动摇，一旦错失抗疫的时间窗口，出现大规模感染，付出的代价会更高，损失会更大。另一方面，短期来看，因为疫情防控，上海经济社会、群众生活确实会受到影响，但从长远来看，防止疫情扩散，换来的是更大范围、更广泛的百姓正常生产生活，是更加宽松、稳定的经济社会发展环境。正因此，我们必须坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，坚定信心迎难而上，咬紧牙关持续奋战，尽快实现社会面清零的目标。
疫情防控越是到最吃劲的时候，民生保障就越要细致。民生保障越有温度，防控工作就会越有力度，也会更有成效。可以说，解决好民生小事，关系“动态清零”大局，关系社会面清零目标的实现。保持群众正常生产生活平稳有序，做好生活必需品生产供应，保障好群众就医需求，这既是抗疫中的一道必答题，也是“动态清零”的必然要求。要尽快实现社会面清零的目标，就必须千方百计加强生活物资保障，持续充实基层防控力量，细心做好群众工作，积极帮助排忧解难。
抗击疫情，信心比黄金更重要。实践反复证明，“动态清零”符合我国实际，是抗击疫情的最佳选择，是科学、有效的。还要看到，虽然上海市报告的感染者数量处于高位，但按照奥密克戎变异毒株流行的指数型增长的参数来看，没有出现指数型上升态势，表明已经采取的防控措施遏制住了指数型上升的势头。我们坚信，有党中央的坚强领导，有中国特色社会主义制度的显著优势，有强大的动员能力和雄厚的综合实力，有全国各地各方面的有力支援，有广大干部群众的积极行动，有广大医护人员和志愿者的无私奉献，有丰富的抗疫经验和各种科学工具，上海完全有能力实现“动态清零”。
在上海新国博方舱医院，墙面上几乎全都被一幅幅手绘画占满，还有医务人员的祝福和患者的感言。“感谢你们来沪共同抗击疫情”“上海加油”……一句句留言，写下的是守望相助的大爱，是战疫必胜的信心。坚定信心迎难而上，咬紧牙关持续奋战，从严从紧、抓细抓实落实各项防控措施，我们一定能尽快打赢这场大仗硬仗！

习近平主席在第七十六届联合国大会一般性辩论上郑重提出全球发展倡议，呼吁国际社会关注发展中国家面临的紧迫问题，共同推动全球发展迈向平衡协调包容新阶段。全球发展倡议将抗疫和疫苗列入八大重点合作领域，为进一步凝聚全球抗疫合力，共创后疫情时代美好世界指明关键路径。
促进共同发展，战胜疫情是当务之急
当前，一些发展中国家因疫返贫、因疫生乱，发达国家也有很多人陷入生活困境。统计显示，人类发展指数30年来首次下降，世界新增1亿多贫困人口，近8亿人生活在饥饿之中。医药卫生等民生领域面临困难。
这场抗疫斗争也存在着国家和地区间不平衡。世卫组织今年1月发布的数据显示，一些发达经济体正大范围推广疫苗加强针接种，非洲大陆接种率却仅有7%。世卫组织194个会员国中仍有36个疫苗接种率不足10%，88个会员国不足40%。
“国际社会应该加紧行动起来，坚决遏制疫情蔓延势头”“全力搞好疫情防控。这是当务之急”“抗击疫情是国际社会面临的最紧迫任务”……两年多来，在一次次视频、电话、信函等“云外交”中，习近平主席谈得最多的就是携手抗疫，因为“这既是坚持人民至上、生命至上的基本要求，也是稳定恢复经济的基本前提”。
人民健康是社会文明进步的基础。如果人民健康水平低下，如果群众患病得不到及时救助，如果疾病控制不力、传染病流行，不仅人民生活水平和质量会受到重大影响，而且社会会付出沉重代价。习近平主席把抗疫和疫苗列为全球发展倡议八大重点合作领域之一，旨在通过各国加强合作，共同战胜疫情，破解当前全球发展困境。
团结抗疫和复苏经济，两手都要抓，两手都要硬。构建人类卫生健康共同体、构建全球发展命运共同体，两大主张彼此呼应，正是统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展这一中国理念的世界表达，也是人类命运共同体在面对疫情挑战时的生动写照。
两年多来，中国坚定不移地推动疫情防控国际合作，坚定不移地为各国特别是广大发展中国家抗击疫情提供支持。中国始终把疫苗作为全球公共产品，促进其公平合理分配，确保在发展中国家的可及性和可负担性。
“不论遇到什么困难，我们都要坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，把促进发展、保障民生置于全球宏观政策的突出位置，落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程，促进现有发展合作机制协同增效，促进全球均衡发展。”
“中国将继续高举真正的多边主义旗帜，坚持与世界相交，与时代相通，在实现自身发展的同时，为全球发展作出更大贡献。”
这些中国主张，为世界战胜疫情、赢得这场事关人类前途命运的重大斗争指明方向。
以人民为中心，共同构筑全球免疫屏障
“我们应该坚持以人民为中心，提升全球发展的公平性、有效性、包容性，努力不让任何一个国家掉队。”
全球发展倡议最核心的理念是以人民为中心。在团结各国共同抗击疫情的过程中，中国始终坚持“人民至上、生命至上”，为全球战胜疫情注入思想动力。
从携手30多个国家一道发起“一带一路”疫苗合作伙伴关系倡议，到成功举办新冠疫苗国际合作论坛；从提出全球疫苗合作行动倡议，到向“新冠疫苗实施计划”捐赠1亿美元；从启动“中国东盟健康之盾”合作倡议，到金砖国家疫苗研发中心启动……中国努力让疫苗成为各国人民用得上、用得起的公共产品。
在巴西，中国科兴新冠疫苗年初获批为当地6岁至17岁儿童和青少年接种，圣保罗马塞利诺少校州900多所学校安全顺利地迎来了新学期；在缅甸，中缅合作生产的新冠疫苗3月正式投产，计划每月生产100万剂；在塞尔维亚，欧洲首家中国疫苗工厂将于年内开始生产中国国药新冠疫苗，助力满足本国、巴尔干国家及欧洲其他国家疫苗需求……
一架架“疫苗航班”跨越山海，一座座疫苗工厂投入运营，一项项中国技术惠及普通民众，书写出一个个共抗疫情、共促发展的生动故事。
截至目前，中国已向120多个国家和国际组织供应超过21亿剂新冠疫苗，全球使用的疫苗有一半是“中国制造”；中国最早支持疫苗知识产权豁免，率先同发展中国家开展联合生产；中国在15个国家已经或正在建设疫苗原液灌装基地，打造当地疫苗生产中心，并向有疫苗合作需求的国家提供相应技术支持。
“中国努力向世界提供疫苗，为世界应对疫情作出巨大贡献。”联合国秘书长古特雷斯表示，“习近平主席提出的全球发展倡议，对推动实现联合国2030年可持续发展目标、解决全球发展不平等不平衡问题具有重要意义。”
坚持团结合作，构建人类卫生健康共同体
“世界各国要加强国际抗疫合作，积极开展药物研发合作，共筑多重抗疫防线，加快建设人类卫生健康共同体”“加快落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程，构建全球发展命运共同体”……在多边主义遭遇逆流的当下，中国展现出同各国共克时艰、携手战胜疫情的坚定意志，彰显出推动落实全球发展倡议的坚定决心。
3月15日，中国援柬埔寨中医抗疫专家组赴柬开展对外医疗援助。6天后，中国援柬埔寨考斯玛中柬友谊医院大楼正式启用，专家组的10名医护骨干向柬方介绍推广疫情防控中国经验，运用中医药组织开展救治工作，助力柬埔寨抗击疫情。
截至目前，中国与180个国家、10多个国际和地区组织分享疫情防控和诊疗方案，向世界卫生组织提交《中医药治疗新冠肺炎循证评价研究报告》；向34个国家派出37支医疗专家组；向国际社会提供了约3720亿只口罩、超过42亿件防护服、84亿人份检测试剂。
中国还承诺，未来3年内提供30亿美元，用于支持发展中国家抗疫和恢复经济社会发展；未来3年内再向东盟提供15亿美元发展援助，用于东盟国家抗疫和恢复经济；继续向亚太经合组织“应对疫情和经济复苏”子基金提供支持，助力各成员恢复和发展经济……
中国积极开展国际抗疫合作，携手各国共克时艰，用实际行动践行全球发展倡议，诠释了构建全球发展共同体和人类卫生健康共同体的应有之义。
巴西中国问题研究中心主任罗尼·林斯表示，中国秉持人类卫生健康共同体理念，积极推进抗疫国际合作，为世界上其他国家作出了表率。
坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆大学中国研究中心主任汉弗莱·莫西表示，中国始终积极参与并推动国际抗疫合作，向多个国家援助医疗设备和新冠疫苗，是多边主义与经济全球化的倡导者与支持者。
人类是一个整体，地球是一个家园。面对共同挑战，人类只有和衷共济、和合共生这一条出路。坚持团结合作，共同落实好全球发展倡议，人类必将共创后疫情时代美好世界！

面对严峻的疫情防控形势，广州市委组织部8日晚发布动员令，要求居住在白云区的市区机关、国企干部职工全部向居住地报到，听从社区疫情防控工作安排。发布仅3小时，市区两级就有7500多名家住白云区的党员积极主动向所在社区报到，协助开展敲门扫楼、入户走访、秩序维护等工作。
“紧急集合！火速支援白云区鹤龙街道。”10日下午，广州酒家集团疫情防控“尖刀班”的20名党员迅速从四面八方集结，一个小时内赶到指定核酸检测点，分成两队开展服务。
“去年8月，我们在全市构建起‘镇（街）党（工）委—村（社区）党组织—综合网格党支部—楼栋（单元）党小组—党员责任区’五级基层组织架构，实现了20849个综合网格建立党组织全覆盖，建立了3.96万个楼栋党小组，划分了50.98万个党员责任区，成立了1.97万支党群服务队。”广州市委组织部有关负责人说，广州还建立完善了“市直机关+市属国企”组团式对口支援区应急工作机制，将全市86个市直部门、28家市管企业共114个单位与11个市辖区定向“结对子”，各区也建立区直单位支援镇（街）疫情防控“尖刀班”“应急队”。
一个支部就是一个堡垒，一名党员就是一面旗帜。广州港集团居住在南沙区12个社区的53名在职党员响应集团党委号召，迅速回到所在社区，参加信息摸排、社区防控、核酸检测、超市供应等志愿服务工作。广州地铁集团调配2000名党员，其中200名专门充实海珠区的“一管控区一工作专班”以及“三人小组”和服务对象“双名单”的防控机制，专人对接服务老弱病残等特殊人群，并配合该区启动先后三轮全员核酸检测。
广州市委组织部副部长陈晓嘉介绍，9日、10日、11日3天，市区两级每天都有15万名党员下沉街道（社区）支援疫情防控，为服务全市疫情防控大局提供组织保障。截至11日21时，广州本次疫情累计报告新冠病毒感染者已增至61例（其中白云区45例），全市11区仍在紧张组织第三轮全员核酸检测。

“这是第一天上地，往后大机械陆续都能进地干活，那就更快了。”梨树县宏旺农机农民专业合作社理事长张文镝说，10多天前，自己还很担心。“正值备春耕关键时期，新冠肺炎疫情形势却严峻复杂。人都动不了，农机咋检修；有路不通车，外地购置的化肥咋运进来？”
确保疫情防控和春耕备耕两不误，吉林省坚决扛稳维护国家粮食安全重任，下大力气保面积、保物资、保人力、保进度、保安全，抓紧抓实抓细备春耕生产。
梨树县是吉林省玉米主产区之一，通过让农民“点对点”上岗务农，引导农民在做好疫情防控的同时不误春耕生产。
吉林省多地出台农民返乡春耕的具体办法，为农民提供“返乡通行证”，安排客车“点对点”返村。截至4月7日，全省各市（州）已返乡5.3万多人。
吉林省吉林市舒兰市是水稻种植大县，如今正掀起水稻育苗高潮。舒兰市18个涉农乡（镇、街道）协调域外供应商与属地内各种植大户、家庭农场签订意向订单，确保春耕生产所需物资及时入村入户。
舒兰市平安镇，李学明经营的家庭农场有127公顷稻田，3月24日就开始了水稻育苗。“咱们农户可以与商户预约，实现农资‘点对点’调运，只要保物资的举措在，备春耕就不犯愁。”李学明说。
吉林省各地畅通农资运输绿色通道，加强运力服务保障。截至目前，农用物资持续到位，种子、化肥到户到位率分别达到95.3%和83.2%，到位进度稍快于往年同期。
主动抢抓农时保进度，吉林省将科学合理放开社会管控，抓紧动员农民下田春管春耕、组织秸秆离田清运等工作，确保春耕生产按时序推进。4月10日，吉林省疫情防控工作新闻发布会详细介绍了金融助力备春耕稳增长30条保障措施。吉林省各银行机构3月份累计发放备春耕贷款84.8亿元，力争今年涉农贷款增速高于上年2个百分点。
“今年春耕打算贷款200多万元。”张文镝盘算着地租、种子、化肥费用，还打算置办几台小拖拉机。
“早育苗、早插秧，能早两个星期秋收，凭着咱们舒兰大米的好品牌，一定能卖个好价钱。”李学明说，虽然疫情使备春耕多了些艰辛，但是盼丰收的心情更迫切。

埃及——
让游客获得不同以往的体验
本报记者 黄培昭
“足不出户，便可游览埃及的很多景点和古迹，如同身临现场一般，这是我没有想到的。”易卜拉欣是一位埃及旅游发烧友，说起数字化旅游，他告诉记者，“这是一种全然不同以往的感受，除了身临其境的真实感之外，还有一种玩游戏的感觉，三维清晰画面比实地参观景点更富有视觉冲击力，而且我还可以掌握前行的节奏，随时随处停下来，或者根据自己的意愿，快进到任何一个感兴趣的地方，真是奇妙。”
为满足疫情防控期间人们的精神文化需求，埃及旅游文物部与科学考古研究所联合推出了“在家体验埃及”系列精品文化项目。在这一框架下，埃及数十家博物馆和考古遗址被纳入数字化虚拟旅游云空间，景点画质高清、图像栩栩如生，并配有图文、视频和音频介绍。
“在家体验埃及”文化项目不仅涵盖吉萨高地三座金字塔、埃及国家博物馆、科普特博物馆等著名景点，还有一些平时较冷门，甚至处于关门维护中的景点。“这极大拓展了人们的旅游范围，激发了人们的兴趣。其中有些景点我以前都没有参观过，现在总算弥补了遗憾，感觉长了不少知识。”易卜拉欣说。
易卜拉欣还介绍，他以前曾数次去阶梯金字塔游览，但对这座埃及历史上最古老的金字塔的许多细节并不了解，这次通过网络游览，仿佛上了一堂生动的历史课。“在现实场景，许多细节并不能看清，加之游人众多，很少有机会静下心来一个人仔细观赏。现在进入数字化虚拟旅游云空间后，三维游览的高清界面可实现360度旋转，仿佛穿越时空，回到了数千年前的埃及历史深处，一些壁画的花纹、质地甚至褶皱、裂纹等，都看得清清楚楚，这是现场旅游很难看到的。”
记者登录易卜拉欣介绍的网站进行体验。果然画面壮观、场景宏大，图像完全模拟游客进入阶梯金字塔的实景设计，移动、前行、回退都十分自如。整个过程寓教于乐，十分有助于激发人们对历史的兴趣。
目前，数字化旅游也还存在一些不足，如在人和场景的互动感方面还有待提升。同时，一些数字化虚拟云游空间页面需要较高的网速，有时会出现卡顿或者页面在某些浏览器环境下无法打开等现象。
在易卜拉欣看来，“这些仅仅是美中不足，无论如何都瑕不掩瑜。在疫情的特殊情形下，人们跨出家门多有不便，‘在家体验埃及’是一个相当不错的畅游埃及的数字化产品。即使疫情过后，我也会继续使用数字化旅游，甚至可以将网下和网上旅游结合起来，从而对景点有更加全面细致的了解。”

游客可以提出从作品到日常生活的各种问题，“米开朗基罗”不仅一一回答，还会向游客介绍其作品。圣母百花大教堂博物馆馆长蒂莫西·韦尔登表示，通过这样一种数字化交互方式，游客可以更好地了解米开朗基罗在艺术上的传承与创新，以及他对当时乃至当今世界的贡献。
意大利拥有丰富的人文和自然旅游资源，在新冠肺炎疫情发生之前的2019年，有约6500万人次外国游客到访意大利。作为历史文化名城，当时佛罗伦萨的游客接待量超过400万人次，是其常住人口的10倍，一些热门景点经常超负荷运营，这也促使该城市在数字技术的应用方面走在了前列。例如早在2016年，佛罗伦萨市政府便与移动运营商合作，通过分析移动数据量，研判不同时间地点的游客数量并提出科学合理的对策。
2017年，意大利政府多部门联合制定了未来5年旅游业战略计划，支持旅游相关企业积极运用数字技术。
许多艺术机构投入数字化大潮，为游客带来更好体验。乌菲齐美术馆是久负盛名的博物馆之一，2018年该美术馆与意大利和美国高校合作开展“乌菲齐数字化项目”，将馆藏的1200多件古希腊和罗马时期雕塑全部进行数字化处理。乌菲齐美术馆还将其中最著名的70多件馆藏作品高清版本放到线上，让全世界的艺术爱好者点击鼠标便能与艺术作品面对面。
目前乌菲齐美术馆定期举办虚拟展览，只要打开官方网站上的“超级视觉”页面，就能浏览当下举行的不同主题展览。许多展览还设置了以真实展厅为蓝本的虚拟展厅，游客可以如同在线下展厅中那样一幅幅观赏艺术作品。
2021年是但丁逝世700周年，乌菲齐美术馆特地在线上展出了16世纪插画家为《神曲》绘制的纸质插图。乌菲齐美术馆馆长艾克·施密特表示，由于纸质藏品十分脆弱，此前这些美丽的画作只有很少一部分向公众展出过，“现在通过网络，所有有兴趣的人都能欣赏”。
德国——
推动旅游业数字化转型
本报记者 张慧中
赫伦贝格市位于德国巴登—符腾堡州，拥有约3.1万居民。小城风景如画，环保美观的半木建筑房屋和设有钟楼博物馆的古老教堂是该市的旅游特色。现在，得益于德国斯图加特高性能计算中心等机构合作开发的“数字孪生”模型，世界各地的人们有望通过虚拟现实技术，饱览赫伦贝格小城的美丽风景。
“数字孪生”模型由空间句法概念发展而来。斯图加特高性能计算中心团队的法比安·德姆斯基博士表示，如同人体骨骼为人的其他系统与功能提供了支架一样，空间句法建构了一个城市的物理网格轮廓，为执行空间分析提供了基础框架。此外，该团队还添加了地理信息系统和交通控制系统等数据，整合城市地形、交通流量等信息。
旅游业是德国的支柱产业之一。据统计，2019年，来德国旅游的外国游客总数约为1.9亿人次。突如其来的新冠肺炎疫情对德国旅游业形成了巨大打击。世界旅游业理事会的报告显示，2019年，德国旅游业收入高达3440亿欧元，2020年大幅降至1830亿欧元。
疫情为德国旅游产业带来挑战的同时，也促使其加速数字技术转型。疫情防控期间，德国推出了各城市景点的虚拟旅游网站；博德博物馆、柏林国立歌剧院、柏林爱乐乐团等机构也纷纷推出虚拟游览、线上听歌剧或音乐会等项目，让世界各地的游客足不出户即可游览德国的自然风光、体验文化艺术。
虚拟旅游是德国旅游业数字化发展的一个方面，数字技术在旅游业领域有着更为广泛的应用。2019年，德国政府提出了“提升旅游业能力创新示范项目”。在该项目支持下，德国石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州的吕贝克湾开发了名为“智能人群控制”的交通管理系统；西南部巴登—符腾堡州的黑森林国家公园则开发相关项目，用以提供有关游客流量的实时信息。
当前，德国仍在加大力度继续推动旅游业的数字化转型。德国国家旅游局董事会主席何佩雅表示，数字化形式和信息技术开辟了更多机会，扩大了旅游机构与客户的精准对话，加强了德国和国际旅游产业的联系，“经历了新冠肺炎疫情，我们进一步强化了数字化能力，在可预见的未来，这将帮助德国旅游业走出困境，变得更加强大”。

596,“动态清零”是上海抗疫最佳方案,申少铁;,2,4/11/22,234,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWRTmupZDNePdqjo_CaxW_nVhMiUkiemmbB-j6ki32Ph9c0T86kPCd6OessBO_3L_QdYb3bnZDve_hUuCiV668ELz8-6jSXZc5kybYh3Se40ZQ4GDEIPkdR&uniplatform=NZKPT,"“当前，上海的疫情形势比较严峻、复杂，坚定执行‘动态清零’是最佳选择，也是最佳方案。”4月10日，国家卫健委疫情应对处置工作领导小组专家组组长、清华大学万科公共卫生与健康学院常务副院长梁万年说。上海市本轮疫情有何特点？防控的难点在哪儿？实行“动态清零”有何意义？记者在上海采访了梁万年。
采取更果断坚定的防控措施
“上海本轮疫情流行的毒株主要是奥密克戎BA.2，传播速度非常快，隐匿性特别强，也就是无症状感染者和轻症病例占比非常高，大大增加了疫情防控的难度。”梁万年说，目前上海市的16个区大部分社区都有感染者，存在着广泛的社区传播。所以，单独依靠过去的疫情防控措施，很难快速控制住疫情。因此，必须要采取更果断坚定的措施。
上海市是2500万人口的国际化大都市，国内、国际交往极为频繁。“上海既要防止市内疫情扩散，又要防止外溢到其他省份，还要防止境外输入，防控压力很大。”梁万年认为，当前，上海市疫情防控最重要的是防止市内扩散和反弹。对这么大一个城市进行疫情防控，无论采取什么措施，比如全员核酸检测，对于城市的组织能力、管理能力等都是巨大的考验。
“统一思想，坚定信心，团结起来才能战胜来势凶猛的疫情。”梁万年说，上海市从基层群众到基层组织，再到区级和市级政府，必须形成一个有效的系统，共同防控疫情。
“在保护人民的生命和健康免受病毒侵害的同时，要保障群众的基本生产和生活。”梁万年认为，平衡疫情防控和群众基本生活及经济社会发展，是上海这样的大城市面临的重要课题。所以，疫情防控必须更快速、更精准、更有效。
上海市的疫情防控策略和措施正在发挥作用。梁万年分析，虽然上海市报告的感染者数量处于高位震荡，但按照奥密克戎变异毒株流行的指数型增长的参数来看，没有出现指数型上升态势，表明采取的防控措施遏制住了指数型上升的势头。“上海疫情处在关键时期和胶着状态，不进则退。要牢牢抓住这个时间窗口，大家一起努力，共同战胜疫情。”
把生命和健康放在第一位
奥密克戎变异株不是“大号流感”，危害性比流感大很多。梁万年认为，与流感相比，奥密克戎变异株传播速度更快，传播的隐匿性更强，更容易造成大范围的传播。更重要的是，奥密克戎变异株致病性明显比流感大。从全球看，如果放任病毒流行，奥密克戎变异株总体病死率比流感要高，特别是老年人群，病死率比普通流感高出几十倍，80岁以上老年人甚至高出近百倍。
“从公共卫生的角度看，全人群都是奥密克戎变异株的易感人群。我国老年人口数量庞大，一些大城市人口老年化率较高。如果‘躺平’，疫情对这类脆弱人群就是一场灾难。”梁万年说，奥密克戎变异株还会不断变异，如果向坏的方向变异，对人类健康危害就会更大。此外，如果出现大规模感染，人们会出现恐慌，造成医疗资源挤兑，让正常的就医需求无法得到保证。所以，我国对奥密克戎变异株采取“动态清零”的总方针是科学、有效的。
梁万年说，应对奥密克戎变异株，一些国家采取“躺平”策略，放任病毒感染，对居民的生命、健康和社会生产造成了巨大危害。我国坚持“动态清零”，一方面是“人民至上、生命至上”防疫理念的指导；另一方面，我国有能力、有基础。我国本土总体上“干净”，社会主义制度具有强大的组织动员能力，群众积极主动配合，加上丰富的抗疫经验和各种科学工具，有能力实现“动态清零”。
梁万年认为，我国坚持“动态清零”，是尽一切努力来维护人民身体健康和生命安全，同时尽一切可能有效精准平衡疫情防控和正常生产生活及经济社会发展。为了实现“动态清零”，对一部分群众进行管控，对他们的生产生活带来不便，但只要快速控制住疫情，可以换取更长时间的正常生产生活和更大范围甚至全国的正常生产生活。“要坚持‘动态清零’总方针不动摇，以最小的成本获取最大的效益。”
“动态清零”的精髓是快速、精准
“动态清零”并不是零容忍、追求完全零感染。梁万年说，“动态清零”是我国抗击疫情的总方针，也是2020年以来我国经历前后几十起各类新冠病毒变异株引起的聚集性疫情，总结出的一套战略性打法。实践反复证明，“动态清零”符合我国实际，也是抗击疫情的最佳选择。“动态清零”的核心内涵是出现疫情后，能够快速发现它，并快速围堵它，切断传播过程，实现发现一起，扑灭一起，不造成持续性社区传播，其精髓就是快速、精准，跑在病毒传播的前面。
上海具备“动态清零”的能力。梁万年分析，只要把传染源控制住，切断传播途径，保护易感人群，就可以实现“动态清零”。如今，我们有核酸检测和抗原自测技术，抗疫的武器更为强大，能尽早将感染者识别出来。上海有丰富的医疗资源，加上全国各地的支援，能够做到对感染者和可能的感染者进行有效收治和隔离。此外，随着疫苗接种不断推进，易感人群将得到进一步保护。
上海疫情什么时候出现社会面“动态清零”？梁万年认为，这基于防控措施的进一步落实落地。目前，全市在对居民进行多轮核酸检测筛查，目的就是把传染源都找出来，并做好隔离和救治，管理好密切接触者，切断传播途径。当所有传染源都做好了隔离和救治，新增的感染者都来自监测人员，就实现了社会面“动态清零”。
“上海人民对抗疫措施的高度支持，让我们感动。”梁万年说，在上海的几天调研中，无论是封控、管控，还是核酸检测、抗原检测，群众都积极配合，给他留下了深刻印象。梁万年表示，上海市民一定要坚定信心，不要恐慌，也不要焦虑，要理解和相信党和政府的抗疫策略和方式。大家要注意防护，保护好自己的身体健康，饮食和睡眠要规律。如果今后按照防范区、管控区、封控区进行分类管理，防范区14天没有阳性感染者，居民可以有一定的活动范围，但要减少不必要的聚集，同时做好个人防护。“大家再坚持一段时间，相信曙光很快会出现。”梁万年说。

为欧亚地区产业链供应链畅通作出贡献
本报记者 牛瑞飞
不久前，从青岛发出的中欧班列（齐鲁号）搭载化工原料、车辆配件、生活用品等货物抵达德国曼海姆市。中欧班列（齐鲁号）中国青岛—德国曼海姆双向对开班列是中欧班列开行的又一条新路线。面对新冠肺炎疫情的冲击，中欧班列安全稳定运行，2021年全年开行1.5万列，运送货物146万标箱，同比分别增长22%、29%，通达欧洲23个国家的180个城市。
疫情发生以来，不断攀升的物流和时间成本给欧洲许多企业带来巨大挑战。疫情造成全球海运价格飞涨、港口拥堵，铁路运输的优势更加凸显。数据显示，中欧班列运输一个标准集装箱的价格远低于在主要海运航线上的平均运输成本。丹麦物流公司DSV称，从中国到欧洲的铁路运输时间是海运所需时间的一半，运输成本是空运的1/4。运输时间的缩短让企业可以更快地对瞬息万变的市场需求做出反应。
法国国家铁路公司SNCF中欧货运列车负责人泽维尔·范德尔波潘说，2019年到2021年间，法国和中国之间的货运列车数量翻了一番，他对中欧班列的未来发展充满希望。据他估算，到2030年，中欧班列的运力将是目前的两倍。
一趟趟列车穿梭于欧亚大陆，源源不断地将防疫物资、机械配件、电子产品等货物运抵目的地—作为共建“一带一路”的重要载体，中欧班列为沿线国家和地区产业链供应链稳定畅通作出了重要贡献，加深了中欧经贸合作，也推动了区域经济复苏。
作为全球第一贸易大国，中国在稳定全球供应链、抑制通胀方面发挥积极作用，为中欧经贸发展注入更多稳定性。在比利时，中国临港集团泽布鲁日现代产业园于去年6月底开工建设，园区物流贸易业务范围将涵盖新能源汽车、跨境电商、冷链运输等；在希腊，中远海运集团控股经营的比雷埃夫斯港年吞吐量不断提升，累计为当地创造直接和间接就业岗位超过1万个，为当地带来直接社会贡献逾14亿欧元……
在全球疫情反复、世界经济复苏放缓背景下，中欧双边贸易规模2021年呈现快速增长势头，经贸等多领域合作展现出旺盛活力和巨大潜力。中国海关总署数据显示，以美元计算，2021年中国与欧盟进出口总值达8281.1亿美元，比上年增长27.5%。中国继续保持欧盟第一大贸易伙伴地位，欧盟为中国第二大贸易伙伴。
“中国经济稳定发展，大力推动与区域内国家高质量共建‘一带一路’，这些都为欧亚地区产业链供应链稳定畅通作出重要贡献。”西班牙IE大学中国研究中心主席菲利克斯·巴尔迪维索认为，推动区域内互联互通是加强经贸交流合作的基础，各国间经贸联系日益紧密，将进一步促进区域经济社会发展。
对接非洲工业化和城市化需求
本报记者 万宇
在坦桑尼亚东北部港口城市坦噶，马文尼水泥厂不久前刚完成升级改造，重新投产。新产品面市以来，凭借强度高、初凝时间短、脱模快、性价比高等优点受到当地客户广泛好评。如今，水泥厂每天水泥销量可达3300多吨，熟料1000吨，实现满产满销，已成为坦桑尼亚第二大水泥制造商。“许多政府基础设施项目都在使用我们的产品。”马文尼水泥厂行政助理安妮塔·穆西高兴地说。
这家生意兴隆的水泥厂在2018年曾一度停产，濒临倒闭。2020年5月，在获得中非发展基金与华新水泥股份有限公司共同投资后，马文尼水泥厂启动环保升级改造，新建了年产160万吨的新型节能环保粉磨站，还应用绿色环保的粉尘回收和余热发电技术，大大降低了水泥厂对周边的粉尘影响。坦桑尼亚驻华大使姆贝尔瓦·凯鲁基表示，这一项目带来了先进技术、促进了当地经济发展、创造了就业岗位，为促进坦中关系友好发展起到积极作用。
马文尼水泥厂是中非发展基金在新冠肺炎疫情防控期间完成投资收购、技术改造、扩建并实现投产的重点项目。作为中非合作论坛重要成果和中国首支对非股权投资基金，中非发展基金紧紧围绕中非“十大合作计划”“八大行动”“九项工程”等重点，帮助非洲国家提高社会综合发展水平，为非洲经济发展创造内生动力。截至2021年底，中非发展基金已累计对37个非洲国家投资近60亿美元，撬动中国企业对非投融资270亿美元。
投融资合作是近年来中非合作的亮点之一，为非洲经济社会发展注入活力。截至2020年底，中国对非投资存量超过434亿美元，涉及50多个非洲国家。中国已经成为非洲第四大投资来源国，3500多家中国企业扎根非洲，民营企业逐渐成为对非投资的主力，聘用非洲本地员工比例超80%，直接和间接创造了数百万个就业机会。
南非国家规划委员会委员米丽亚姆·奥尔特曼认为，来自中国的投资助力非洲更好地融入全球价值链。中国企业不但为当地带来品质优良、价格适中的产品和装备，也带来更多的投资、管理经验以及创新活力，同非洲工业化和城市化需求对接，有力带动了当地经济发展。
在中非合作框架下，中国企业对非投资在聚焦基础设施、制造行业、能源矿产、工业加工等传统领域的同时，也在关注中高技术制造、医疗医药、数字经济、航空产业等新领域的发展与合作。由湖北人福医药集团与中非发展基金在马里共同投资的人福非洲药业股份有限公司是西非地区建设标准最高的现代化药厂之一。药厂投产使马里市场上的基础药品价格大幅下降。新冠肺炎疫情防控期间，药厂全力保障正常生产，极大缓解了马里及周边国家的药品短缺问题，有力支援了西非地区的防疫工作。
联合国非洲经济委员会执行秘书薇拉·松圭认为，疫情防控背景下，中国持续推动企业对非洲投资，为非洲国家创造了许多就业机会，也促进了非洲经济复苏发展。与此同时，双方均关注并致力于实现可持续发展，未来非中合作将愈发密切和深入。
深化与东盟各国的数字技术合作
本报记者 孙广勇
在曼谷郊区一个2万平方米的物流仓库内，当地员工威猜在工位上轻点电脑屏幕，货架上的货物由多台自动引导运输车接力送到他的工作台前，贴好标签后再通过传送带送上货车。两天后，这些商品就能到达泰国各地的消费者手中。
这是东南亚最大的自动化仓储系统，由菜鸟与泰国快递公司闪电达携手打造，日均处理能力保持在6000单，最高日处理能力可达2万单。在这里，商品的入库、分拣、包装、出库等环节都实现了自动化处理。仓库运营负责人披叻说，来自中国的先进技术让物流仓储环节的出错率更低、仓储效率和发货能力更高，彻底改变了以前拣货速度跟不上订单增长的窘境。
近年来，泰国电商市场发展迅猛，作为泰国当地单量最大的快递公司之一，闪电达在本土拥有超过2000个网点，每天派送单量超过200万单，业务覆盖东南亚大多数国家。随着电商交易量不断增长，原有的物流和仓储系统的短板逐渐显现。为改变这种情况，当地电商平台在同中国企业开展跨境贸易的同时，引入成熟的技术经验和运作模式，改进技术、物流及支付体系，并将直播等营销新模式引入东南亚电商市场。
“中国企业帮助泰国建设智能数字物流中心，不仅能提高两国间的物流效率，还将助力泰国成为区域物流枢纽，为柬埔寨、老挝、缅甸和越南等国提供服务。”闪电达创始人兼首席运营官狄玮杰表示。
泰国政府一直致力于推动各行业数字化转型和数字经济发展，以提升国家竞争力。泰国总理巴育表示，先进的信息及通信技术和数字创新在支持泰国经济韧性和可持续发展方面发挥了重要作用。
发展数字经济是泰国等东盟国家经济转型升级的重要驱动力，中国和东盟国家的数字物流合作是双方数字经济合作的一个缩影。2015年，东盟数字经济产值占国内生产总值的比重为1.3%，到2025年，该数字有望提升至8.5%。2021年初，东盟数字部长系列会议通过了《东盟数字总体规划2025》，与会部长期待东盟与中国加强政策协调，深化数字技术和应用等领域合作。
“中国在发展数字基础设施等方面走在前列，是东盟推动本地区数字经济发展的理想伙伴。”东盟秘书长林玉辉认为，中国的支持将为东盟数字化转型增添新活力，未来双方将在金融科技、数字化转型等领域开辟全新合作局面。东盟与中国加强数字化互联互通有利于区域经济保持活力与竞争力。
目前，中国和东盟正抓住新一轮科技革命和产业变革机遇，在智慧城市、5G、人工智能、电子商务、大数据、区块链等领域打造更多新的合作亮点。一大批中国5G、数据中心和云服务提供商在东盟国家启动和落地相关项目，为当地建立和完善数字生态系统、电子商务和支付平台提供了巨大支持。新加坡《联合早报》刊文指出，中国科技公司在人工智能、大数据和金融科技等领域拥有许多领先技术。通过与中国企业合作，本地企业能够提升科技能力，催化更具创意的解决方案，进而带来更多增长机遇。
“数字化发展是东盟经济共同体建设的三大重点领域之一，关系到东盟国家经济复苏和可持续发展，与中国的合作推动了本地区经济社会发展。”泰国国家行政学院政治系教授派汕表示，“未来，期待双方推进数字基础设施建设合作，提升数字互联互通水平，共同推动区域经济复苏。”
增强拉美国家内生发展动力
本报记者 李晓骁
在秘鲁安第斯山脉高原腹地的瓦努科省，几台大型设备正在紧张作业，沥青被均匀地铺到指定地点，碾压机来回压实，平整崭新的沥青路面逐渐成形。这是瓦努科至瓦杨柯公路扩建项目，项目连接秘鲁山区和该国主要外贸中心，由中铁二十局集团有限公司承建。扩建项目完成后，这条全长约236公里的公路还将与泛美公路相连，极大改善当地交通状况，惠及沿线243个城镇的近30万民众。
“在共建‘一带一路’框架下，秘中合作不断加强，2020年秘鲁25%的外国直接投资来自中国。这些投资有力地推动了秘鲁经济社会发展，也给当地民众带来实惠。”秘鲁国立圣马科斯大学亚洲问题研究中心主任卡洛斯·阿基诺表示。
瓦努科至瓦杨柯公路扩建项目是中拉基建投资合作的一个缩影。在阿根廷，中国企业投资承建的阿根廷赫利俄斯风电项目群分布在该国高山、荒漠和沿海地区，有效促进该国环境保护事业发展和能源转型，同时为当地提供了超过1000个工作岗位；在巴西，中企投资承建的美丽山二期特高压输电项目，将巴西北部的清洁水电源源不断地输送至东南部，为2200多万巴西民众提供了稳定的电力保障；在智利，中企获得智利5号公路塔尔卡—奇廉段的特许经营权后，对全长约195公里的既有道路进行扩建改造，并新设13处电子收费系统，缓解了区域交通压力，也促进了该项目沿线地区经济增长……
近年来，中国与拉美国家共建“一带一路”合作持续深入，拉美地区已是中国对外投资的第二大目的地，在拉美的中资企业超过2700家。近20年间，中国在拉美地区已投入使用或在建的基础设施项目共138个，项目资金总额超过940亿美元，为当地创造逾60万个就业岗位。
疫情发生以来，世界各国特别是发展中国家的经济社会发展受到严重冲击，拉美地区遭遇严重的经济衰退。疫情并未减缓中拉经贸合作的发展势头，双方在基建投资领域的合作契合拉美地区发展需求，也为拉美国家增强内生发展动力和经济社会发展韧性提供了支持，中拉经贸合作显现出蓬勃生机。
智利塔尔卡大学工业工程系学者埃内斯托·桑蒂瓦涅斯认为，拉美国家对于优质基础设施和先进技术的需求不断增加，拉中产品、技术、服务交流日益密切，特别是中国对拉美国家基础设施领域的投资持续促进地区国家发展。
当前，中国大力支持数字产业发展，有序推进5G、大数据、物联网等数字技术应用和新型基础设施建设。“拉中在绿色低碳、数字基础设施等领域的合作有着广阔发展空间，将推动拉美地区可持续发展。”墨西哥国立自治大学国际问题专家伊格纳西奥·马丁内斯说。
随着中国与拉美多国签署共建“一带一路”合作文件，中拉合作在未来将全面推进。阿基诺指出，中国经济快速稳定增长，并向高质量发展转型。作为拉美第二大贸易伙伴和拉美多国的主要投资来源国，中国经济发展对拉美地区的积极影响正进一步显现。“一个发展的中国将使世界受益。”阿基诺说。

在库代别尔根看来，北京克服了各种困难，成为全球首个“双奥之城”，这就是北京冬奥精神的体现。“中国能够迎难而上，成功举办本届冬奥会，未来也一定能够克服各种困难，在各项事业中取得新的成就。”
法国巴黎第八大学教授、中国问题专家皮埃尔·皮卡尔表示，北京冬奥精神的内涵具有全球普遍性，反映出整个人类文明需要克服困难、团结向前。“这一精神呼吁人们秉持包容开放的态度，共创美好未来，这和中国提出的构建人类命运共同体理念一致，为凝聚更多力量、共同应对全球性挑战提供了精神动力。”
日本长野县驹根市议员小原茂幸表示，在全球疫情仍然蔓延的背景下，中国成功举办冬奥会、冬残奥会殊为不易，体现了重信守诺的精神。北京冬奥精神的提出令人振奋，将促进世界各国人民增进相互理解，深化友谊与合作。
“北京冬奥精神的提出，让世界看到一个开放奋进、自信向前的中国。”拉杰布认为，北京冬奥精神体现了合作共赢、携手进步的理念，有利于团结各国并肩努力，为构建人类命运共同体贡献力量，一起向未来。

与病毒较量，是物质的角力，也是精神的对垒、意志力的比拼。来势汹汹的奥密克戎变异株具有传播速度快、隐性感染和轻症病例比例高等特点。面对如此狡猾的奥密克戎变异株，一方面兵贵神速，我们必须坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，态度坚决果断，行动迅速有力，实现“以快制快”；另一方面“动态清零”需要时间，我们也必须咬紧牙关、坚持不懈，坚决克服麻痹思想、厌战情绪、侥幸心理、松劲心态，坚守防疫抗疫各个岗位，积小胜为大胜。惟有如此，才能早日战胜疫情。
行百里者半九十。当前，上海疫情处于高位流行，抗疫进入“最关键，最吃劲”阶段。越是在这样的时候，越要保持战略定力，越要以“咬定青山不放松”的韧劲、“越是艰险越向前”的拼劲，继续攻坚克难、顽强奋战。坚持再坚持，努力再努力，一定能尽快打赢这场大仗硬仗，尽快恢复生产生活秩序。
坚守才能胜利，坚守定能胜利。目前，各地已有数万名医务人员支援上海，江苏、浙江紧急为上海提供6万间隔离房，多地米面粮油、瓜果蔬菜等物资供应纷纷抵达抗疫一线，“一方有难、八方支援”的守望相助，正汇聚成战胜疫情的强大合力。只要大家心往一处想、劲往一处使，坚定信心、团结奋斗，相信胜利并不遥远，曙光就在前方。

尽锐出战护佑健康
在过去的24小时里，上海崇明花博会复兴馆方舱医院安徽医科大学第一附属医院方舱院区院长陈明卫，只休息了不到4个小时。
“4月4日凌晨，我所在的方舱院区正式收治患者，今天已经是第五天了。”作为领队，陈明卫既要进入方舱医院内部查房、会诊，还要负责整个队伍的管理、协调、保障工作。陈明卫介绍：“从接到任务到接收病人，只有不到48小时。在安徽省援沪医疗队临时党委的领导下，我和团队定人定岗、明确职责，现场调研、敲定流程，还要做好院感防控培训、制定应急预案，为打赢疫情防控攻坚战、避免医护人员感染创造条件。”
“皖沪一家亲”。得知要派人支援上海，陈明卫向安医大一附院党委请缨，并带上了最精锐的骨干——160人的队伍。这支队伍由安医大一附院牵头，16家医院共同组建，包括120多名护士，20多名医生。许多医护人员参加过援鄂医疗工作，经验丰富，战斗力强，而且专门调集了6名院感防控专家，帮助方舱医院的医护、干警、保洁等工作人员做好专业培训。“我们还设置了多个党员示范岗，充分发挥党员带头作用，承担最苦最难的任务。”陈明卫说。
结合连日来在方舱医院的实践，陈明卫表示，我国坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针不动摇是完全正确的，是真正的以人为本，“我国老龄化程度较高，而且慢性基础病高发。奥密克戎并不是所谓的‘大号流感’，对于高风险人群来说，一旦感染，就可能面临生命威胁。因此，我们要加强分级分类监测管理，尽快控制住疫情。”
“眼下，面对严峻复杂的防控形势和快速增长的感染人数，我们要坚定信心。有党中央坚强领导，有伟大抗疫精神的鼓舞，有来自全国各地援沪医疗队的鼎力支持，相信上海一定能战胜眼前的困难，打赢这场疫情防控攻坚战。”陈明卫说。
在护理中倾注关爱
下午4点半，王丽萍才刚吃上几口泡面，这是她走出方舱医院后一顿简单的“午餐”。
王丽萍是浙江省人民医院的护士长，如今，她和1500多名浙江援沪医疗队员一起，奋战在上海临港方舱医院，全力为患者服务。
俗话说“三分治疗，七分护理”，足见护理工作的重要。王丽萍所在的这支医疗队伍有150人，其中护士有119人。每组护士14人，要服务600多名患者。尽管大多是无症状感染者，但护理工作依然不轻松。每天，护士们人均走2万多步，脱下防护用具时，都能看到满身的汗水、红肿的耳根和留下深深压痕的鼻翼。“这是一场硬仗，我们做好了思想准备。”王丽萍说。
护理，不仅要关注身体，还体现在心理安抚上。“不少新冠病毒感染者感到焦虑，更需要我们及时关心，注重倾听。”王丽萍说，“有一名新冠病毒感染者入住后，不停地打电话。我们主动询问，得知他80多岁的老父亲留在家中，还患有癫痫，这让他十分担心。我们赶紧与他家所在社区取得联系，为他父亲提供帮助，消除他的后顾之忧。”
对新冠病毒感染者的用心，体现在浙江援沪医疗队工作的方方面面。“每名感染者进来之前，我们都要进行评估，了解病史等情况。保障他们的生命安全永远是第一位的。”浙江省卫生健康委副主任、省人民医院院长、浙江援沪方舱医院医疗队总领队葛明华介绍，医务人员在提供治疗服务的同时，还注重对感染者进行科普讲解，有效缓解大家的焦虑情绪，增强了信心。
据悉，浙江援沪方舱医院医疗队于3月30日受命组建并于3月31日晚组建完毕，4月1日晚开始分批驰援上海抗击新冠肺炎疫情。医疗总队由10支医疗队组成，共有队员1555名，其中医生258名，护士1220名。
注重发挥中医药作用
“头一天晚上赶往医院报到，准备物资，第二天一早6点就去火车站，直奔上海。”回想一周前出发时的场景，湖北省中医院援沪医疗队队长肖明中说，“两年前，是上海支援我们，现在我们必须顶上。”
4月6日，湖北医疗队接管上海新国博方舱医院的医疗任务，肖明中和23名医院同事进入W1舱开展工作。“这里每个舱最大可容纳约1500个床位，目前已收治1300多名新冠病毒感染者，工作紧张有序。”
收治的新冠病毒感染者病情如何？肖明中介绍，方舱收治的主要是轻症和无症状感染者，有些人表现出发热、咳嗽、咽痛等症状，但病情总体稳定。
“相信医务人员，相信中医的作用。”这是方舱医院里经常听到的话。“你们是湖北来的？”刘先生刚来上海，一家人都不幸被感染，人生地不熟，再加上担心病情加重，他急得几宿都没睡着。当看到肖明中的防护服上写着“湖北省中医院”，他放心了，“中医在抗击疫情中起了大作用，我相信您，这下我能睡个安心觉了。”
经历武汉抗疫，中医的突出作用被更多人熟知。如今，肖明中和同事们也在值班过程中尽力去实施多种中医疗法：“三方”中成药化湿败毒颗粒的使用；教患者按揉列缺穴、膻中穴，揉或者拍双侧肺俞穴治疗咳嗽；教新冠病毒感染者轻刮大椎穴治疗发热；带领大家练习“八段锦”等传统功法，受到许多人的喜爱。
疫情防控中，实践多次证明，中医药在加快阳性患者转阴，加强后续康复等方面都有明显作用和优势。“在武汉抗疫保卫战中，面对那么多危重症挑战，中西医协同作战已经取得了较好的疗效。如今，在上海的方舱医院，中医特色治疗更加成熟，我们会尽全力为新冠病毒感染者提供有疗效、更便捷的中医药服务，帮助大家早日康复。”肖明中说。

上海全市奋力保供，全国各地大力支援，而打通“最后一百米”的责任，则落在了社区。
超大城市，社区形态各异，不同群体关切点也不同。为了打通“最后一百米”，上海基层社区多措并举，党建、社会和市场力量拧成一股绳，奋力排忧解难，在特殊时期体现特殊精神和特殊担当。
党员干部亮身份
“200多份爱心餐，我们今天送完了！”4月7日中午，在普陀区长征镇新城党群服务中心，社区事务受理服务中心主任李炜罡长舒一口气。
平日里，长征镇一直有为行动不便的老人送爱心餐的服务。4月1日起浦西封控，社区食堂仍坚持为留守工作人员和老人们做饭。
此前，爱心餐配送由第三方负责，封控后，驻守党群服务中心的16名工作人员当起“送餐员”。
“兵分多路，用最短时间把餐食送到小区门口，再由居委会干部送到老人家中，确保老人拿到饭还是热的。”长征镇社区事务受理服务中心老龄办工作人员刘佳说。
爱心餐的受益群体，原为80周岁以上行动不便或长护险评估为5级以上的老人，此前共有178名。考虑到疫情防控期间很多老年人用餐受到影响，长征镇决定不再设门槛，规定凡是确有用餐困难的老年人都可以向居委会申请。如今，爱心餐每日送餐量在230至240份。
长宁区江苏路街道的岐山村小区，是上海知名新式里弄，拥有钱学森、施蛰存、杜重远等名人故居。“老弄堂四通八达，出入口很多”，岐山居民区党总支书记朱卫红说，为了有序防疫，弄堂所有小门都关闭，居民除了核酸检测足不出户。“将近100位老人出门不方便，医生和居委会干部就爬楼一个个采样。”
孕妇产检、患者血透、大重病就诊——江苏路街道居民服务组设立24小时专线，有需求必有回应。
“我们归纳了‘共情抗疫群众工作十法’，坚持生命优先、生活优先、安全优先”，江苏路街道党工委书记戴涛说，街道保留10个机关工作人员在街道防控指挥部协调工作，其余街道班子成员、党员干部等全部下沉居民区一线。
筛查启动至今，江苏路街道工作人员接听居民来电1394通、受理各类服务需求9492项，向独居老人、残障人士及经济困难家庭提供保障型蔬菜礼包138份，协助血透、大重病、孕产妇等外出就诊322人次、代配药702人次，为社区居民提供批量型保障菜品22911份。
上海各部门、地区党组织正统筹工作力量下沉社区，抽调机关、企事业单位党员干部下沉基层一线，31.3万名社区报到的在职党员化身“大白”“保安”“外卖小哥”“搬运工”……
志愿服务添力量
4月6日，在浦东新区北蔡镇，南新第四居民区党总支书记何秀梅穿着防护服，拿着电喇叭维持核酸检测秩序。
“为了避免居民接触，检测点位都是移动的”，一幢楼完成采样，她和志愿者搬起桌子、设备，带着医护人员迅速走向另外一幢。
南新第四居民区下辖2个居民小区，共有居民1800余户、4600余人。居委会和物业工作人员平均下来，每人要服务400位居民。
78岁的老党员戎凤英站了出来，带头在疫情防控一线帮忙。透过面罩，记者能看到她脸上的汗珠，“抗疫要靠大家，我是党员，虽然年纪大了，也要竭尽全力。”戎凤英说。
让何秀梅意外的是，很多以前不太参加社区活动的年轻人也加入进来。70名固定志愿者，每天负责送菜送药、组织核酸检测、帮助老人操作手机……“今天早上我还和志愿者们说，没有你们，我真的撑不下来，太感谢了！”何秀梅说。
位于闵行区的上海康城，是上海最大的半开放式社区，有286个楼栋、近4万居民。封控期间，这样大体量的小区如何管理，是极大的考验。
7日下午，上海康城第一居民区办公室门口，不时有人戴着口罩匆匆赶来，向居民区党总支书记、居委会主任周艳报到，“我是志愿者！”
“请出示核酸检测阴性证明！”正在忙碌的周艳直起身提醒。当天下午，居民区内要开展抗原检测，整箱整箱的试剂盒刚送到，她就在微信群发了通知。不到半个小时，20多名志愿者赶来，换上隔离服进行分装。
“居委会基本工作人员只有9人，要为6000多位居民服务，防疫、保供千头万绪，工作量太大，根本忙不过来”，周艳说，好在有志愿者挺身而出，目前登记在册的有100多名。
群策群力保供应
“我母亲92岁了，心绞痛发作，有什么办法？”4月2日，一位居民在嘉里华庭一期微信群求助。一个小时内，小区群策群力，凑齐急用药品、血氧计、带心电图功能的手表，居委会开好外出就医证明，直到老人生命体征平稳，大家才放下心。
小区所属的曹家堰居民区党总支书记计凤林说：“特殊时期，居民自治发挥了重要作用，解决急难，也加深了邻里感情。”
嘉里华庭还是一个涉外小区，近半居民为海外人士。如何让他们理解抗疫要求，避免不必要的冲突？几位志愿者把上海防疫要求翻译成外语，发给外籍居民，让他们也充分理解、配合防疫。
7日中午，普陀区象源丽都小区门口，摆放数百包蔬菜、鸡蛋、水果。
“这都是居民团购的，300份，我们帮送到居民楼下”，满头大汗的居民谢冠红说，居民自发组群团购，多方拓展渠道和货源。
“我不会骑电瓶车，为了送菜现学的”，象源丽都居民区党总支书记倪晓倩说，近40位小区“蓝骑士”，打通了社区配送的“最后一百米”。
市场力量和居民自治力量，是抗疫保供的生力军。
陈通表示，上海支持保供企业在全国统筹调配资源，引进充实新的保供人员。允许非涉疫原因被封控在小区的快递小哥等保供人员，走出封控区，回到保供岗位。

4月1日，部分新能源初创车企发布了亮眼的月度“成绩单”，其中，前5家企业月销超万台，同比增速均超一倍。3日，比亚迪宣布，3月份已停产燃油车，并以超过10.43万辆的销量刷新国内新能源车企月销纪录。
“尽管受疫情、芯片短缺、锂价上涨等不利因素影响，我国新能源乘用车依然延续了高增长态势。”全国乘用车联席会秘书长崔东树说，预计一季度产销依然会翻番，中国新能源汽车在全球市场份额也提升到65%的新高。
抗疫情、保交付，产业链为行业增长提供有力支撑
清明假期刚过，位于广州番禺区的广汽埃安工厂就恢复到了满产状态。3月份，广汽埃安销量同比大幅增长189%，在众多新造车品牌中率先跨过月销2万辆门槛。
“面对疫情、缺芯、原材料价格上涨等诸多压力，埃安热销态势未减，为确保交付，2月份工厂利用春节假期实施了产能扩建升级。”广汽埃安总经理古惠南介绍，1月31日至2月14日，埃安工厂利用短短15天完成产能扩建。产能扩建后，埃安智能工厂实现生产效率提升45%，定制化能力提升35%，有力推动3月产销量实现快速突破。
同样为确保交付倾尽全力的，还有智己汽车。受疫情影响，3月底智己汽车位于上海嘉定区的工作园区一度处于封闭状态，但为了确保首款产品按时交付，智己汽车的产品开发、营销和测试团队，一刻也没有松懈。
“为了将疫情影响降到最低，智能驾驶团队200多名员工分成4个小分队，分别隔离在上海4家酒店。”智己汽车联席CEO刘涛介绍，他们把酒店会议室临时改成办公室，把酒店地下停车场变成了临时测试场，对车辆进行不间断联调测试。与此同时，上海临港工厂的生产、检测都在按计划正常进行。
“我国汽车产能布局相对均衡，华东、西南、华南、华北、东北等地区产量占比分别为19%、17%、16%、14%和12%。尽管吉林和上海的疫情对生产造成影响，但两地汽车产量全国占比只有两成左右。”崔东树分析，新能源汽车相对完备且自主可控的产业链，也为行业增长提供了有力支撑。
性能优、新车多，进入市场驱动为主的发展阶段
“我们近期在一个地方车展做了测试，用5天时间观察现场看车行为，发现60%—70%的消费者在看新能源车。”谈起当前新能源汽车市场的热度，比亚迪股份有限公司董事长兼总裁王传福介绍，我国新能源汽车渗透率2021年1月为6%，到去年年底增长至22%，平均每个月提升1.3个百分点。
“老百姓用实际行动在支持新能源车”。王传福表示，如果说十年前，新能源汽车发展主要靠政策驱动；三五年前，行业发展是“政策+市场”双轮驱动；那么当前主要靠市场驱动，“这是新能源车渗透率逐月提升的直接原因”。
——产品性能快速提升。CTP无模组电池包技术、刀片电池、弹夹电池、半固态电池……近年来，我国动力电池行业持续创新突破，骨干企业电池系统循环寿命超过5000次，2021年，我国纯电动乘用车平均续驶里程已经从2016年的253公里提高至400公里以上。续航里程达到1000公里的多款新产品今年将投放市场。
——有竞争力的新产品加速涌现。仅在轿跑车细分市场，今年有竞争力的全新产品就有近10款。据统计，2021年我国新上市新能源车型达70款，目前在售新能源车型总量达289款，覆盖了轿车、SUV、MPV等几乎全部乘用车细分市场。
——产业发展配套环境进一步优化。截至今年2月，累计建成充电桩261.7万个，换电站1405个，在31个省区市设立动力电池回收服务网点超1万个。
强化协作、保障供应，多策并举稳定产业运行
“早知道要涨价，旧车置换就该抓点紧。”清明假期，北京的王女士跑了趟汽车市场。打算换辆新能源车的她发现，时隔一个月，不少之前关注的车型，价格都涨了。
小鹏汽车在售车型售价上调1.01万—2万元，理想汽车售价上调1.1万元，宏光MINI EV涨价4000—4200元……受上游原材料持续大幅上涨的影响，3月1日起，已有近20家新能源车企宣布涨价，涉及车型超过40款。其中，特斯拉多款车型月内已涨价三轮，目前最高涨幅已超3万元。
统计数据显示，电池级碳酸锂、氢氧化锂市场价格分别从2021年初的5.2万元/吨、4.95万元/吨飙涨至今年2月底的48万元/吨和44万元/吨。
“针对电池级碳酸锂、氢氧化锂价格大幅上涨，要适度加快国内资源开发进度，坚决打击囤积居奇、投机炒作等不正当竞争行为。”在日前召开的中国电动汽车百人会论坛上，工业和信息化部副部长辛国斌表示，要引导产业链上下游企业强化协作、共同发展，推动关键原材料价格回归理性。
“进入新阶段，攻坚突破的困难和复杂程度都在增大，一些新情况、新问题需要着力解决。”辛国斌表示，一是要完善支持政策体系，修订完善双积分管理办法，探索建立灵活性调节机制，明确后续年度积分比例要求；配合相关部门研究新能源汽车购置税优惠等支持政策。二是深化融合创新，加快新体系电池、车规级芯片、车用操作系统等关键技术攻关和产业化。三是继续做好汽车芯片保供，努力保障关键零部件生产供应，深入推进换电模式应用和燃料电池汽车示范，着力破解小区、高速公路充电难的问题。四是加强功能安全、数据安全、网络安全监管，提升动力电池热失控报警和安全防护水平，让消费者更喜欢买、更放心用。
“2021年到2030年，我国新能源汽车市场进入快速增长的新阶段，预计到2030年左右销量与燃油车基本持平。”中国科学院院士欧阳明高说。

一直坚守在疫情防控一线，任劳任怨；始终把群众的事放在心上，无怨无悔；对工作无限热爱，从不计较……乔良牺牲的消息传来，妻子张彩和儿子乔俊龙的电话就没断过，“都是同事和群众打来的慰问电话”；乔良组建的“邻里守望”微信群里，写满了感激和不舍……
“看到乔警官的身影，心里就踏实”
2月4日5时30分，参加疫情防控安保部署会；6时30分，骑车到熙景园核酸检测点；7时整，忙前跑后维持核酸筛查秩序；9时30分，因过度劳累，身体出现异常反应……19时47分，经医务人员全力抢救无效死亡。
这是乔良生命的最后时刻。
“那天早上很冷，零下七八摄氏度，乔良之前一直没有休息好，又不顾劳累带病工作。我9点50分赶到熙景园时，看到他特别疲惫，脸色也不好，劝他赶紧去医院。”朝夕相处的老同事王煜，清晰记得乔良生前说过的最后一句话：“没事，我还能坚持。”
瑞景派出所副所长宋佳强说，新冠疫情发生以来，乔良既肩负着抗疫任务，又要守护熙景园片区安全，一直处于超负荷工作状态。“除夕那天，他们警组白天值班，忙了一整天，晚上又到社区巡查非法燃放烟花爆竹，一直忙到凌晨1点多。看到他脸色不对，我就让他倒休回家歇一天，老乔还是那句话，‘没问题，我还能坚持’。”宋佳强回忆。
疫情防控期间，乔良总是冲锋在前。“维护秩序、协助筛查，方方面面的工作，他都没落下；社区防火、防盗、防电信诈骗，他都没耽误；每天早晨8点半开完例会，他就沉到片区一线，走入群众之中。”同事夏存说。
“在社区一线工作多年，老乔干活特别踏实。疫情防控期间，社区里有不配合流调工作的情况，居委会便会直接给老乔打电话，无论多忙，他就是一句话‘把电话给我’，随后便动之以情、晓之以理，直到把工作做通为止。” 宋佳强说。
“有他在，我们就安心”“看到乔警官的身影，心里就踏实”……乔良以社区为家，与群众在一起，把全部精力和时间投入到疫情防控工作中，赢得了群众发自内心的称赞。
“他心里装的永远是群众，很少考虑自己”
“永远把群众的事放心上”“想到的只有群众，却唯独不想自己”……这是同事和群众对乔良的评价，也是这位基层民警的真实写照。
“从扎根基层无私奉献的乔良身上，我们学会了怎样做好群众工作，怎样让自己真正融入群众之中，和群众心贴心。”乔良因公牺牲后，回忆起他的事迹，瑞景派出所民警无不满怀敬仰。
“他心里装的永远是群众，很少考虑自己。他生病的老母亲已经80多岁，遗憾的是，他临走前没能留给家人一句话，只留下了一身正气和群众的口碑……”接受记者采访时，宋佳强一度哽咽。
“做群众工作时，乔良有一股‘执着劲儿’。有他在，群众心里就踏实。”北辰区紫瑞园社区党群服务中心党委副书记吴琼说。一天，片区居民家中着火，参与完灭火并安抚好群众情绪后，乔良又逐楼、逐栋、逐户排查，一家不漏地宣传防火知识，消除安全隐患。有的居民白天上班不在家，他就晚上再上门，直到人人知晓。
针对电信网络诈骗案件高发态势，乔良重点抓好防范工作。有糖尿病、高血压等疾病的老乔，时常拖着疲惫的身躯，挨家挨户提醒。他先是把常见的电信网络诈骗类型做成彩印宣传单发放，之后又挨家挨户宣传安装防电信诈骗APP……
群众利益无小事。对群众工作极度认真、尽责，始终把群众冷暖放在心头，从不敢有丝毫懈怠，乔良用情、用心交出了一份闪光的答卷。
“在看似平凡的岗位上，作出了不平凡的业绩”
“干一行，就得爱一行，他的心中只有对工作的热爱”“没有轰轰烈烈的壮举，却在看似平凡的岗位上，作出了不平凡的业绩”……很多同事这样评价乔良。
为了找到嫌疑人，即便希望渺茫，他依然在案发地蹲守了一个星期；为了打击扒窃，他天天拿着喇叭，走街串巷宣传；每逢节假日，万家团圆之时，家里总是缺他一个……
“乔良太热爱公安工作了，只要是交给他的工作，他都能保质保量做好，不讲任何条件，也从来不提困难。”宋佳强说，之前辖区内王庄市场时有扒窃案件发生，为了守护群众财产安全，乔良索性把“家”安在了市场警务室，以方便一早在市场内巡逻。一个人的力量不够，他又组建了9人组成的市场秩序维护队，每天拿着小喇叭在市场里喊话，提醒群众注意防范。“经过他们的努力，市场内扒窃案件大幅度下降，当地老百姓都念他的好。”
“既然选择了这份工作，就要干出个样子来！”乔良没有豪言壮语，却有一身正气。在他的影响下，巡逻队员个个奋勇争先。有一次，在北辰区王庄村，他带的巡逻队员抓获两名小偷，受到有关部门表彰。
遇到困难上，遇到荣誉让。“评先评优，他都谦虚推让，把荣誉让给年轻人”“他是老百姓认可的好民警，群众爱戴，才是最大的荣誉”，说起乔良，战友们感慨良多。
“抗疫战冬春，年节舍此身。警民情不改，仁义大名存。”“老乔：一路走好，精神永存！”……群众送别乔良的留言，道出了对一名人民警察的深情厚谊。

要采取一系列手段保障封控区、管控区心血管疾病、癌症等特殊患者就医需求
本报北京4月6日电 （记者申少铁）国务院联防联控机制6日召开新闻发布会，介绍从严从实抓好疫情防控工作有关情况。国家卫健委新闻发言人、宣传司副司长米锋说，当前，全国新增本土确诊病例和无症状感染者快速增长，部分地区社区传播仍未阻断，疫情仍在高位运行，防控形势严峻复杂。要继续坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，快字当头，加紧推进重点地区应检尽检、应收尽收、应隔尽隔、应治尽治。
3月1日至4月5日，全国累计报告本土感染者176455例，波及29个省份。国家卫健委疾控局副局长、一级巡视员雷正龙说，全国疫情总体呈现流行范围广，规模性疫情与散发疫情交织，外溢病例及续发疫情多发等特点。3月中旬以来，随着各地疫情防控措施的有效落实，此前疫情较为严重的5个省市中，广东、山东、河北等均呈现向好态势，但上海和吉林疫情仍处于发展状态。
“上海疫情防控正处于关键时期。国家将根据需要继续往上海调派支援力量。”米锋介绍，按照党中央、国务院决策部署，国家卫生健康委已从全国15个省份调派医务人员3.8万余人和每日238万管核酸检测的能力支持上海，开展核酸检测和新冠肺炎患者救治工作，帮助提升医疗救治与核酸检测能力。
“多地疫情得到有效控制证明，从严从紧采取隔离、管控、封控、筛查等为核心的措施应对奥密克戎变异株引发的聚集性疫情依然有效，可以实现‘动态清零’的既定方针。”雷正龙说，下一步，国务院联防联控机制综合组将继续指导各地提升应对规模性疫情的能力。在发生疫情后，抓住主要矛盾，聚焦重点地区，从紧从严、从早从快、从细从实落实各项防控措施，坚决筑牢疫情防控屏障。
目前，我国新冠病毒感染者大多为无症状和轻症。北京大学第一医院感染疾病科主任王贵强分析，无症状感染者包括潜伏期感染者，可能出现症状甚至病情进展。轻型病例个别可能出现疾病进展，尤其是年龄大、有基础病以及未接种或未全程接种疫苗人群。因此，在管理无症状感染者和轻型病例时一定要有医务人员在场，在方舱医院里要安排医务人员和必要的诊疗设备，包括抢救设备、基本用药等。
当前，一些地方对中高风险的社区采取管控措施，如何保障心血管疾病、癌症等特殊患者的就医需求？王贵强说，疫情防控和基本的医疗救治都非常重要，封控区、管控区的群众看病问题应该引起高度重视，特别是重危患者，要采取一系列手段保证这些病患能够得到及时、有效的治疗。国务院联防联控机制要求，医疗机构在急诊、抢救室、手术室、医院病房以及妇产科要有相应的应急区域或者缓冲病区，以便救治核酸检测未出结果前的重危患者。各地要统计孕产妇、透析人群、放化疗人群的基本底数，把本底摸清楚，建立台账，并有效跟踪随访，以便及时救治。对需长期用药的慢性病患者，要安排就近的医疗机构给予相应药物处方，建议结合病情将处方延长到12周，并提供上门送药服务。对于封控区、管控区的群众用药问题，要有健康咨询、心理咨询，包括慢性病的咨询问诊工作，充分发挥互联网诊疗优势，解决百姓足不出户的日常看病需求。
春暖花开，我国疫情防控形势是否会好转？中国疾控中心流行病学首席专家吴尊友分析，这取决于我国防控策略以及防控措施落实力度。受全球第四波疫情影响，我国“外防输入”压力特别大，一定要坚持落实疫情防控“四早”政策，压实四方责任，把防控措施落到实处。“坚持‘外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和‘动态清零’总方针，从严从实把防控措施落实到每一个环节，近期呈现的疫情多点散发的形势很快会得到好转。”吴尊友表示。
截至4月5日，全国累计报告接种新冠疫苗32亿8358.6万剂次，接种总人数达12亿7872.4万人，已完成全程接种12亿4322.6万人，全程接种人数占全国总人口的88.18%。完成加强免疫接种7亿569.3万人。60岁以上老年人接种覆盖人数达2亿2418.2万人。

应当看到，目前主要流行的奥密克戎变异株传播速度更快、隐匿性更强，无症状感染者人数多、比例高是本轮疫情的明显特点，很多感染者感染后短时间内没有表现出临床症状。越是在这个时候，越不能掉以轻心。从无症状感染者情况看，一是虽无症状，但一样有传染性；二是今天无症状，部分患者可能两三天就出现症状了。从全球范围看，奥密克戎变异株的流行，对一个国家总体造成的危害并没有减轻。我国是一个人口大国，一个非常小的发病率或死亡率，乘以14亿多的人口基数，绝对数就会很大。只有做到“动态清零”，才能消除疫情隐患，规避大规模人群感染可能造成的医疗资源挤兑，防止大量老人或有基础疾病者等可能出现的死亡。针对我国当前的疫情形势，力争在短时间内做到“动态清零”，依然是最经济、最有效的疫情防控策略。要坚持“动态清零”总方针不犹豫不动摇，态度坚决果断，行动迅速有力，把党中央、国务院关于疫情防控的决策部署落到实处，同心协力尽快打赢这场大仗硬仗。
坚持就是胜利，坚持才能胜利，这是我国抗疫斗争取得重大战略成果的深刻启示。面对近期全国本土聚集性疫情呈现点多、面广、频发的特点，尤其要加强组织领导，保持头脑清醒，坚决克服麻痹思想、厌战情绪、侥幸心理、松劲心态，以时不我待的精神抓实抓细疫情防控各项工作。我国疫情防控经验证明，靠有效的行政措施，以及广大群众的积极配合，可以实现精准防控、动态清零的目标，即便出现疫情局部规模暴发的情况，也依旧可以很快将其控制住。要坚定信心，快字当头，把各项措施做得更快、更准，落实得更细，加快核酸筛查和风险人员排查管控，加紧推进重点地区应检尽检、应收尽收、应隔尽隔、应治尽治，齐心协力战胜这波疫情。
上下同欲者胜，同舟共济者兴。这些天，“守‘沪’有我”的铿锵誓言响遍上海的各个角落。每个人都行动起来，为尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延贡献自己的一份力量。广大市民全力配合核酸采样等防疫工作，自觉做好个人防护，通过线上等渠道互相帮助、互相打气。广大医务人员日夜奋战，挺在最前面，全力守护人民生命健康安全。党员干部尽职尽责、带头冲锋，让党旗高高飘扬在疫情防控斗争第一线。社区干部以及志愿者兢兢业业、无私奉献，确保各项防疫和日常生活保障工作有序进行。来自各地区各部门和军队的广大医务人员紧急支援上海，展现了“一方有难、八方支援”的大爱精神。同心协力，迎难而上，相信在各方共同努力和通力配合下，上海一定能够早日战胜疫情，尽快恢复生产生活常态。
常态化疫情防控是一项艰巨繁重又需要持久坚持的工作，各地区各部门各方面必须有充分的思想准备和工作准备。我们坚信，有以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导，有中国特色社会主义制度的显著优势，有强大的动员能力和雄厚的综合实力，有全党全军全国各族人民的团结奋斗，我们一定能统筹好疫情防控和经济社会发展，用最小的代价实现最大的防控效果，维护和巩固我国来之不易的疫情防控成果，有力有效保障人民群众生命健康和经济社会发展。

自3月初上海本土疫情发生以来，全市广大党员干部冲锋在前，在关键时刻发挥先锋模范作用。3月24日，中共上海市委组织部发出致全市共产党员的一封信，号召全市党员带头亮明党员身份、落实“双报到”要求，主动到对口联系或所在社区参加防疫工作，与基层干部群众并肩作战，在疫情排查、小区封控、群众服务等工作中当先锋、作表率。
浦东新区隧成居民区的配送物资，预计将在深夜或次日凌晨运达。居民区党总支书记夜里10点收到消息，随即在微信群里传达任务，短短几分钟，30名“双报到”党员已完成自发接龙报名。500余箱蔬菜凌晨到达，中午时分就送到了居民家中。
“核酸检测，我们会！”“我们多出一份力，就有一份核酸报告能早一点出来！”中国科学院上海巴斯德研究所的党员们给所党委写下“请战书”，组建起“彩虹先锋队”临时党支部，奔赴嘉定区支援核酸检测实验室。
国网上海市电力公司迅速组织53支“明灯”共产党员服务队、26支党员突击队，为全市核酸检测点、临时隔离场所、防疫制品生产企业等建设供电配套项目18个，实施接电、扩容超过6.3万千伏安。在中石油加油站，有时一名党员就顶一个班组，连续顶岗300多小时。
得知自己居住的九里亭小区即将封闭管理，黄浦区五里桥街道妇联主席祁莉萍坐不住了，第一时间报名加入了小区在职党员疫情防控临时党支部，参与到小区防疫工作中。她说：“挑战来临，党员就应该用实际行动作表率。”
“我是共产党员我先上！”随着上海市一批方舱医院陆续启用，上海市公安局迅速制定工作方案，组织市局机关增援警力入驻浦东世博展览馆、新国际博览中心等方舱医院。4月2日凌晨1时，来自刑侦总队的8名一线侦查员首批进入世博展览馆执行勤务，第一时间与驻场医护人员进行任务对接，熟悉场地基本情况，分区域开展常规巡视守护，确保不扰民、无死角。
按照“一点一方案”的要求，上海公安机关周密制定集中隔离收治点安全管理工作方案，明确岗位职责、勤务模式和处置流程，科学安排勤务运作，组织好场内外巡逻防控、秩序维护、警情处置等工作，做到无缝衔接、不遗不漏。在场外设置警务室，在场内按照区域设置警民联系点，民警在防护服上明确标识“警察”字样和党徽，亮明身份，便于工作人员和群众及时联系求助。
截至4月6日，上海已发动68.6万名在职党员向社区报到，除警察、医务工作者、社工等已在岗工作以及不符合相关条件的人员外，31.3万名报到的在职党员已分为9155组编入相关区、街镇和村居工作队伍，广泛参与小区封控、核酸检测、物资保障、垃圾清运、特殊群体关爱等工作。

消息一出，社区里260余名志愿者积极响应、踊跃报名。根据年龄、专业、特长分工，居委会工作人员和志愿者在18个采样点服务值守，确保采样过程有序开展。
在普陀区，志愿者已经成为疫情防控中的一支重要力量。普陀区鼓励党员向社区报到，同时联动党代表、人大代表、政协委员和团员青年志愿者，共计形成2.7万余人的集中封控区志愿者储备库。在社区报到的党员、机关干部等人员就地组建社区抗疫工作小组，按照“区级下派、属地管理、属地使用”原则下沉一线，在党组织的领导下投入防控工作。
普陀区青少年教育活动中心教师朱凌佳就地下沉，成为所住的真北一居民区党员志愿者。在接受记者视频连线采访时，她说：“疫情面前，党员志愿者就是抗疫一线的战士。一声令下，马上集结。”
真北一居民区党总支书记施蓉说，对出现过新冠病毒感染者的楼栋，居委会工作人员和志愿者带领医护人员挨家挨户上门采样，“我们共同努力，并肩作战，心连心，共同抗击疫情。”
志愿者参与社区疫情防控，不仅充实了工作力量，也带来了不少有效的工作方法。
普陀区各居（村）委会共组建了278个“支援力量”微信群，挑选多名志愿者组长，就地指挥志愿者充分发挥力量。长风新村街道中山桥居民区志愿者团队群策群力，绘制了两张“作战图”。一张图为志愿者分工，按工作内容划分多个板块，志愿者根据自身所长进入适合板块，织密服务网格；另一张图为核酸检测采样路线图，楼栋号、检查点、检测路线、队列方向、离开路线等一目了然，将采样居民动线交集压缩到最小程度。来自区级机关、驻地大型国企的志愿者，加班加点设计志愿者任务分领表、工作提示，细化12项任务5类支撑力量，助力志愿者快速准确上岗。

优化疏导 顺畅出行
清明假期，交通出行较为集中。公安部近日向社会公众发布道路交通安全预警。结合近3年清明假期期间道路交通事故情况，公安部提示：自驾出行应提前了解当地祭扫、疫情防控政策和天气、路况信息，合理规划出行时间和路线；驾乘汽车务必全程全员系好安全带，骑乘摩托车、电动自行车务必全程戴好安全头盔。
在抓好疫情防控的同时，各地交管部门着力做好假期交通运输保障工作。
天津公安交管部门加大交通事故多发时段、路段和交通易堵点段警力部署，并联合市城市公用事业管理局推出清明假期期间便利停车便民服务举措。在不影响交通安全和正常通行秩序的前提下，市民可以在各大超市、菜市场、临街商铺、旅游景点等临时单排顺行停放车辆。同时，加大巡查疏导。
在河北，公路、铁路、民航、港口等部门加大运力投放，严格落实安全保障，优化服务举措。河北邯郸在高速公路增加疏导和备岗人员，开启全部车道，做好车辆疏导工作。加大道路巡查和清洁力度，重点排查公路水毁、塌方、桥涵安全通行承载能力和路面隐患，切实为过往司乘人员做好服务保障工作。
在浙江新昌，县交警大队罗列出35个易拥堵点，派出7个执勤执法小组，联动镇街、村（社区）开展假期交通安全保畅工作。
重庆渝中区交通局对辖区客运公司开展安全督导，督促企业做好清明运力保障等。清明重点祭扫地区重要时段客流较多，渝中区交通局采取灵活的运营组织措施，及时调整辖区内主要接驳线路班次结构，强化运行组织保障，做好中转接驳和应急支援。
甘肃省交通运输厅提前设立引导标识，合理规划利用现有收费车道和免费专用通道，切实提高ETC车道和人工车道通行效率。同时，加密路段和收费站广场视频巡查频次，24小时动态即时调度，筛查拥堵缓行收费站，多渠道、多形式准确、及时、高效发布路况信息。
针对清明假期出行特点，中铁呼和浩特局统筹做好疫情防控和运输组织工作，动态调整列车开行计划，开行低风险城市间旅客列车，努力满足旅客出行需求。新疆铁路部门结合短途客流较多、旅客出行较为集中的特点，统筹疫情防控和客流运输组织，按照“应流开车、精准匹配、梯次投放”的原则，动态安排运力投放和客车开行。
做好防疫 文明祭扫
民政部近期召开电视电话会议，部署清明祭扫安全管理和服务保障工作。会议指出，确保人民群众健康祭扫、安全祭扫、文明祭扫是今年清明节祭扫工作的重点任务。各级民政部门和殡葬服务机构既要避免出现聚集性疫情和规模性反弹，又要努力满足群众的祭扫需求。各地要大力推广网络祭扫、鲜花祭扫、家庭追思等文明低碳祭扫方式。
在内蒙古包头，当地民政部门引导服务机构广泛开展网络祭扫、代客祭扫等服务，倡导市民以敬献鲜花、诵读祭文、网上祭扫、居家祭奠等环保的方式缅怀先人、悼念逝者。同时，协调公安、城市执法、市场监管等部门对相关市场进行联合检查，严厉打击封建迷信用品制售活动。
在江西南昌，市、县（区）民政部门指导经营性公墓、城乡公益性公墓所在乡镇、村委会在严格落实疫情防控措施的前提下，开展文明祭扫活动，组织集体祭扫仪式、向墓位敬献鲜花、开放网上祭扫平台、清理墓区环境等，满足群众追忆故人的需要。同时，引导群众通过居家追思、网上祭扫、书写寄语等方式缅怀亲人，倡议市外人员非必要不跨省跨市回乡、不跨县区祭扫。
广东东莞倡导“就地过节休假，尽量避免或减少出行”。全国爱国主义教育基地鸦片战争博物馆推出清明系列文化活动，以“云祭扫”“云课堂”“云互动”等形式开展线上祭奠。市民登录相关平台，即可一同在线祭奠英烈。
据悉，为在疫情防控的同时做好英烈祭扫工作，广西退役军人事务系统制定了疫情防控期间的烈士清明祭扫服务保障工作方案，避免出现规模性的祭扫聚集。广西退役军人事务厅还通过官方新媒体平台，为全国各地老兵和烈属开展网上祭扫、直播代祭扫等服务，为社会各界缅怀先烈、致敬英雄提供便利。
消防值守 加强巡查
清明期间，进山扫墓、野外踏青等入林活动和野外违规用火现象大幅增加，野外火源管控难度加大。3月28日起，江西南昌开始在全市布置森林防火任务，加强清明期间的森林火情预防和督查，要求严格落实森林防灭火网格化巡查和林农交错区定点看护两项制度，对重点林区、重点部位防火隔离带、防火线等进行全覆盖巡查。
贵州贵阳市乌当区根据辖区森林覆盖面大的特点，强化林区、景区森林防火卡点设置，做到扫码入林，杜绝火源进山。加大巡山频次，杜绝野外用火。通过加强森林防火宣传，引导群众采用鲜花祭扫。乌当区提前组建覆盖全区8个乡镇、5个街道办事处及重点行业部门的16支应急救援队伍，强化清明假期值班备勤工作，确保有效处置。
“您好，当前已进入森林火灾高火险期，在森林防火区内，禁止上坟烧纸钱、烧香点烛等，倡导改用鲜花祭祀，请您配合。”连日来，河北张家口蔚县应急管理局综合统筹，扎实抓好防火工作，确保人民生命财产安全。蔚县各乡镇设置森林防火临时检查卡点，倡导文明祭祀，并通过村（社）护林员、巡查员加强隐患巡查，严防火源进林。
为确保清明期间消防安全，新疆森林消防总队巴音郭楞蒙古自治州支队库车市靠前驻防分队扎实开展执勤备战、防火督查、森林防火宣传等工作。为做好清明前后防火宣传工作，该分队在重点时段采取线上线下同步宣传的方式开展科普宣教，通过社区大喇叭广播、网络系列直播、张贴标语海报等方式，倡导群众文明祭扫。驻防期间，该分队联合库车市塔里木乡公益林中心管护站成立检查组，加大对胡杨林内外祭扫点及周边区域的防火检查督查，及时督促相关单位清理胡杨林内和墓地周边堆放的芦苇秆、棉花秆等可燃物。

中共中央政治局委员、上海市委书记李强出席有关活动。
当前，上海疫情处于高位流行，各项防控措施正在有力有序推进。孙春兰听取国家专家指导组汇报，到上海市疾病预防控制中心调研并主持召开有关专家座谈会，实地考察世博展览中心方舱医院、长宁区新泾五村，了解流调排查、转运收治、社区管控等措施的落实情况。她指出，在2500万人口的特大城市应对奥密克戎疫情，还要保持核心功能的正常运转，任务艰巨、挑战巨大。要尽快提升核酸检测能力，周密组织开展全员核酸筛查，不漏一户、不落一人，抓紧摸清疫情本底。要改扩建方舱医院和定点收治医院，备足隔离房间，快速转运收治感染者，及时开展流调排查，追踪管控风险人员，做到日清日结。要从严从紧加强社区管控，保障好居民基本生活和正常就医需求，开展区域协查，严防疫情外溢。对关键行业、重点机构等要实行严格的闭环管理，确保核心功能正常运转、供应链产业链畅通。
在吉林市期间，孙春兰每天召开专家座谈会分析研判疫情形势，每晚视频调度各区县应收尽收、应隔尽隔，推动实施社会面“清零”行动，集中资源力量对疫情较重的船营、昌邑、高新三个区发起总攻，推进流调排查、“四应四尽”、社区封控、服务保障等综合防控措施落到实处。目前，吉林市社区新发现的感染者明显下降，疫情得到有效控制。

612,更早发现疫情 更快落实措施,杨彦帆;,2,4/2/22,781,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWPdu85sur0sYGFA4kyiNqcbvz9O1_PE5aaBbpwK-X4fKxuE_ZTQKd8_lCHlrRA6n_1UYchRqMDF3ZWvvxxqbCmGR6GRsXcCkej83k7mQBlhx_MLZdYcZ0z&uniplatform=NZKPT,"本报北京4月1日电　（记者杨彦帆）在国务院联防联控机制1日召开的新闻发布会上，国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长、一级巡视员雷正龙表示，我国疫情防控面临“外防输入、内防反弹”的压力依然很大，同时段多地发生奥密克戎疫情的风险依然存在，防控形势仍然严峻复杂。
“3月1日—31日，全国累计报告本土感染者10万3965例，呈现出点多、面广、频发的特点。”雷正龙说，其中，1万例以上的省份有2个。吉林省疫情仍处于发展阶段，累计报告感染者超过4.4万例，吉林市和长春市管控区域内社区传播还没有阻断；上海市疫情正处于快速上升阶段，累计报告感染者超过3.6万例，并外溢到部分省份，近期感染者数量仍将增加。近日全国报告新增感染者90%来自这两个省市。辽宁沈阳、河北唐山、福建泉州疫情社区传播的风险依然较高。山东、江苏、浙江的疫情整体趋好。广东疫情整体平稳，但外防输入压力时刻存在。北京近5天报告的感染者均来自管控人员，疫情整体平稳。
中国疾控中心流行病学首席专家吴尊友表示，尽管奥密克戎BA.2毒株流行时具有较高比例的无症状感染者，但由于其传播速度快，短时间内会产生大量的感染者。通过分析国外一些数据可以看出，奥密克戎毒株流行期间造成的死亡人数，比德尔塔毒株流行期间同期造成的死亡人数还要高。奥密克戎毒株的流行对一个国家或地区的危害依然十分严重。吴尊友表示，实现“动态清零”目标，要更早发现疫情，更快落实各项防控措施。
清明假期临近，吴尊友提示，外出踏青、郊游要注意落实个人防护措施，了解目的地疫情情况，不建议跨省旅行。对于非跨省的祭扫活动，一定要了解墓地所在地的疫情情况，以及墓地管理规定。如果涉及跨省，不建议安排传统的祭扫活动，可以利用现代电子技术，开展网络或者虚拟祭扫。
截至3月31日，全国累计报告接种新冠病毒疫苗32亿7087.4万剂次，完成全程接种的人数为12亿4228.1万人。60岁以上老年人接种覆盖人数达2亿2370.8万人，完成全程接种2亿1257.2万人，完成加强免疫接种1亿4363.7万人。中国疾控中心免疫规划首席专家王华庆说，接种疫苗的获益远远大于风险。建议60岁以上的老人，只要没有禁忌，不是缓种的对象，要尽快接种疫苗，并按照规定时间间隔接种加强针。
《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第九版）》指出，轻型病例实行集中隔离管理。北京大学第一医院感染疾病科主任王贵强解释，密切接触者和轻型病例、无症状感染者不能同时在同一个空间进行隔离观察，一定要区分开，避免进一步传播的风险。方舱内的患者以及医护人员会严格做好个人防护和消毒隔离，新的患者进入方舱不会对原来的患者造成不良影响，不会引起感染扩散。

613,疫情发生以来检察机关起诉涉疫情案件逾万件,张璁;,11,4/1/22,80,https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=ImqjoT-6ruWPdu85sur0sYGFA4kyiNqcbvz9O1_PE5aaBbpwK-X4fKxuE_ZTQKd8qaQpdPpLcQDfy2fMe7XyS9_DVFxFhKrRxzNaM6_fcwDSnYRGz2kugqEbuA1WxlYi&uniplatform=NZKPT,"本报北京3月31日电　（记者张璁）记者从最高人民检察院获悉：新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，全国各级检察机关严格在法治轨道上依法战疫，有力维护疫情防控秩序。据统计，截至2022年2月，检察机关共批准逮捕涉疫情案件7047件9377人，不捕1584件2528人；起诉11340件15666人，不诉1437件2393人。
据介绍，从近期检察机关办理的妨害疫情防控秩序犯罪情况看，这些违法犯罪活动涉及多行业、多领域，具体行为呈现不同特点，有的危害后果和情节较为严重。特别是在当前国际疫情迅猛发展、国内疫情多点暴发的形势下，能否严格落实机场、边境口岸等重点区域，环境消杀、物流快递等重点行业，核酸检测、封控管理等重点环节的防控措施，直接关系到“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略和“动态清零”总方针能否实现。在此背景下，仍有一些单位和个人，严重违反有关疫情防控政策要求，人为造成疫情传播严重后果或者重大传播风险，情节十分恶劣。
据悉，3月31日，最高检发布第十六批全国检察机关依法办理涉新冠肺炎疫情典型案例，涉及消极、懈怠执行区域疫情防控措施，伪造核酸检测证明供物流行业使用，伪造核酸检测报告、破坏进口冷链食品管理秩序等妨害疫情防控秩序的犯罪行为。最高检第一检察厅负责人表示，此次典型案例的发布，目的在于指导检察机关依法办理涉疫情防控案件，尽快遏制疫情扩散蔓延势头，进一步引导人民群众自觉遵守疫情防控有关法律法规。
